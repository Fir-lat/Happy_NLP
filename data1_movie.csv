4,"The first episode spent far too much time showing rather than telling. There was no 'grab you by the balls and never letting go'. The show spent fifteen minutes of boredom in a forty-six minute episode. The story of the protagonist is could be summed up in less than five minutes. I don't need that much time to understand the background story. The action is limited to a few moments, then it is back to boring dialogue. The best scenes are when the antagonist (Ethan Hawke) is present. I gathered more information and more action when he was present during a five minute scene than in eighty minutes of Steven/Marc talking to each other in a mirror.

The second episode was worse. They rehashed the same story again and wasted twenty minutes doing it. Enough all ready. We know the backstory. You only needed five minutes to do that, stop dragging this out and get in to the action.

The casting is fine. Ethan Hawke is fantastic. Wow he really has his character nailed. Oscar Isaac is good, but I think they spend far too much time forcing him to talk about his problems and how he is trying to resist what is happening to him. His character is intelligent. It shouldn't take him that long to realize what is needed. Heck, he puts sand around his bed, tethers himself to the bed, and knows that he has creatures chasing him. This conflict doesn't make sense.

When there are action scenes the show is at its best. The cinematography is good. The backdrops at night are the best. The dark and sinister feeling you get is like walking in to an alley with shadows chasing after you."
9,"I heard of Moon Knight, but never really knew the hold story, but then I saw the first episode on Disney plus, and I gotta say I'm excited for what comes next. Oscar Issac really takes us on this journey, playing like a Cary Grant like style.

Nice to see another Marvel Character is making there debut, seems like at the moment that it's trying to stand on it's own, without trying to be a reminder that it's in the marvel universe, and I hope it stays that way. Ethan Hawke is great in his role, I'd rather not spoil who he plays."
8,"A strong first episode setting the scene of a multiple personality protagonist. The reflection metaphors work well (mirrors, puddles, scales ...) even if they are pasted on so thickly. So too the missing time around the girl, the goldfish and most impactfully the fighting. The use of implied violence is compelling especially in the car chase where there is already explosive action - this also informs us of the character of the alter ego.

Passable acting from the three main characters - Isaac, Hawke and Calamawy. Some of the support cast, however, are poor, notably the wooden portrayal of the museum supervisor played by Lucy Thackeray - who, based on this single example, could not act her way out of a paper bag!"
8,"I loved the whole ep, Oscar Isaac is perfect for this role. I can't really talk to much about it but the way they presented moon knight was a kids dream , super cool and true to what a hero is . I don't think I got that moved ever for a superhero introduction."
4,"Another mediocre show.

We are accustomed to the fact that the content that arrives is usually boring, tedious, with hilarious dialogue and predictable characters and situations, because producers set certain requirements that writers must adhere to.

If certain characters and situations are not written, as well as certain dialogues, the series or film will not be funded. That's why most movies and shows today are predictable and tedious.

It might be a lot more interesting, but unfortunately, this is just another in a series of boring and predictable mediocre productions. Oscar Isaac is a good actor, but it's just weird to hear him speak with a British accent. It doesn't sound bad, but it does sound like a parody at times.

The show is barely watchable, with solid special effects, nothing new we haven't seen before. Most series and movies have almost identical characters and themes, which made most of them predictable, tedious and boring. Oscar Isaac is a solid actor and a good choice for this role, but the script is, as usual, mediocre and predictably lukewarm.

Moon Knight is no different from most film productions and fits into the mediocrity of today's entertainment industry. Unfortunately, most shows have become tedious, predictable and boring.

The show has solid acting talent, but that's all it has, it doesn't even have an interesting action scenes. It might be a lot more interesting, but unfortunately, this is just another in a series of boring and predictable mediocre productions.

In the end, this is just another lukewarm show that is not worth wasting time on."
10,"This was amazing.

Totally what I wasn't expecting, but it blew my mind into the stratosphere...

I love the pacing and the storytelling route they have chosen for this extraordinary adventure.

MOON KNIGHT HAS RISEN ??"
1,"I usually love anything about superheroes, be it Marvel or DC ,doesnt matter...This series is so bad I can barely sit thru it and thats fastforwarding thru the most boring parts...Which ,for me ,is about 2/3rds of the show...Why dont I like it? Well, its the main character ...Watching him wimpering thru his psychosis for an hr just doesnt make for an interesting super hero show...This is really poor writing and when the superhero starts to come out, it sounds like he;s channelling ""Venom"" from the movie..Ive liked Oscar issac in Dune and Ex machina. But what they have him playing here is not in the least appealing...Hrad to believe anyone would find it interesting to watch this...Hard pass..."
10,"Creators, with all its details, one episode that made me excited, the sequel of the series, mentioning the civilization of Egypt, makes me feel proud because I am an Arab."
7,"Okay, it's just two episodes in so this isn't a comprehensive review but I like it so far. First episode was great, I loved how we sorta get to look at it from Spencer's point of view and you can feel how panicked and nervous he always is and what he deals with, I was however left yearning to see more of the Egyptian mystical powers and we only got a glimpse but the following episode gives us a better picture. It's taking longer than I thought to build up but I wouldn't call it slow paced, i think I'm just eager to see everything unleashed. I love how stand-alone it is and how I have to remind myself it's a marvel production which makes me even more excited to see how all this fits into the MCU( I don't read the comics). Oscar Isaac is great and I've always been into Egyptian mythology and I'm excited to see Egyptian gods brought into life by marvel and hope it lives up to it's potential. Ethan hawk as the antagonist is also perfect for the role and steals the show every time he's on. Only thing I'm not too pleased about so far is it's a spencer show all the way and we don't get to see moon knight fully released, or the power of the gods, but then again it's only two episodes in and maybe that's how the story's told in the books. Also, in episode two marvel tried to sneak in a few forced laughs, I've been saying this for a while, as good as it is to have a laugh but we need to be released from the clutches of whoever decided superhero movies and shows all need to have laughs in it. If there's an uncontrived funny scene that's fine, but don't go out of your way to devise one; it's absolutely perfect for it to be dark or serious. Humor in like deadpool for example was amazing and made sense for the character, doesn't mean it should spill over to everything else. Apart from that, so far so good, it's a good start and I hope it only keeps getting better from here."
8,"Let me start by saying this review may go down depending on future episodes... I'm rating this based on the premier... it may even go higher who knows. What I do know is I was VERY surprised... when I saw the trailers I was thinking it would be average at best mcu show... but This is everything I wanted venom to be... idk why I liked this so much. Just Based on the first episode alone it definitely has some things that aren't explained thoroughly and leaves it open, and I can see why people may say ""wait until the other episodes come out and their score may go higher"" I understand. But I love this so much because I feel like marvel matured a bit more with this one. It still has that similar MCU charm but it has a very thrilling element... it is very similar to venom this idea of something taking over your body and talking in your head... it has a very Jason Bourne feel to it with a mystery feel... a dash of superhero charm... Idk why I liked it so much but I just know I did.... I believe it just had to do with how well they mastered suspense, thriller, dash of horror, complex story and a sense of mystery into one episode alone. It was very captivating and also OSCAR ISSACS performance blew my mind... very impressive

Pros: Oscar Isaac knocks it out this world, the story and plot is very mysterious, the show has a great and clear direction for what it's trying to achieve even though it's not explained thoroughly in one episode...

Cons: will have to check out other episodes to maybe explain more on what just happened... some things feel a little pushed fast, not too fast but just things are happening a bit faster than it should."
9,"A good start!

Some first episodes like Wandavisiin was a turn off for me but got better!

Moonknight took a great start.

Oscar did a brilliant English accent, but like Chris Pratt did on Graham Norton show.

This series is going places, I know there will be highs and lows but this is a high!"
9,What an amazing first episode. The camera work was delightful the way it made me felt as confused as him was amazing. Plus the dialogue between himself sold it.
9,"Great! The mystery of the storey drew me in and kept me there. It touches on a very dark aspect (mental illness) that a character may have, despite the fact that he or she is a superhero! Well, perhaps a superhero. What are the chances? However, it already feels distinct from previous MCU efforts. I'm quite interested to see where this goes!"
9,"Well - I'm not one Episode in - but I enjoyed it - it's good. Let's see how it all plays out - but so far, do good. Oscar Isaacs is pulling it off - as well as Ethan Hawk - See where it goes from here!"
7,"Unless you're a die hard marvel fan that will literally watch every marvel stuff, the only reasons i can think of to watch Moon Knight is it's 'looks' great and Oscar Isaac. Great acting, his British accent isn't cringe and he looks mighty fine. As any marvel films/series, it's very visually driven, the rest, nothing much. The Series is okay so far, watchable but nothing extraordinary."
7,"Aside from the obvious faking of London locations which people who've never been to London won't notice, although why you would fake the National Gallery when the place would never have held the exhibition is anyone's guess this isn't as bad as I expected. Isaacs is quite good and so far the show hasn't clumsily done a bait and switch or introduced identity politics. Perhaps that is for next week. This is a Marvel show, after all. Ethan Hawke gets very little to do but hopefully that will change."
10,"This feels like walking into a conversation at a party kinda awkward, but after an hour and a nice buzz you're all of a sudden best friends with your new company. Oscar absolutely slays in this so far. I can't wait to see the beast unleashed like in daredevil and punisher. The best episode of literally anything I have seen in years. Lovin' it."
9,"Everbody who is somebody knows that Dale Carnegie says that to win friends and influence people one of the dire requirements is that one must be ""Lavish in his praise"" so I was p o'd when at 40'58"" the run credits only until 45'32"". Why so short? Skimping on the praise, like that? So disappointing, I gotta tell ya. Such misers, these people. Would it have kilt them to do an additional 5 minutes? I wouldn't be surprised if Oscar quits the just to show solidarity with his mates that didn't get their due. Too bad Will Smith is not in this one."
5,"Writing on this series needs work. The show deals with creepy elements such as the afterlife, Egyptian gods, and so on, but they're handled without the usual panache that makes those elements grab the viewer. We're two episodes in, and it's a mostly cut and dried ho-hum story with on-the-nose statements about what's happening."
8,"The first episode of Marvel's latest Disney+ series Moon Knight far exceeded my expectations . During its first 40 odd minutes, I was treated to a brilliant performance by Oscar Isaacs (with a cool British accent), captivating on-location photography and a gripping tale of mental anguish. It wasn't until the final five minutes that we get a glimpse of what this show is all about - another Marvel superhero flick with all the requisite Marvel CGIs and action scenes. Let's hope the next five episodes will focus on what makes this episode beyond great and less of the Marvel formula that we have become accustomed and subject to."
3,"I did not expect this to be great or even good, but it did surprise me with regards to the ways in which it was bad.

First and foremost, it was painful to watch Oscar Isaac struggle with a British accent.

I always thought of him as a decent actors, but he was so clearly uncomfortable trying to affect the accent that is made me uncomfortable.

Next, of course, was the very lackluster story development, which seems to be Disney's signature these days.

Compounding that was the very poor dialogue; even the casual banter was awkward and stilted.

Alas, the other problem was treatment of the hero.

The insistence on denigrating certain people and exalting others based purely on immutable traits like gender, race, and sexuality is impossible to ignore.

Ironically, it also has the opposite of its intended effect.

That is to say, the fact that the writers are trying to hard to shoehorn in certain ideologies is painful obvious and therefore rings false.

Consequently, instead of liking the characters you are being pushed to idolize, you end up disliking them, in this case, intensely.

One thing that saves a lot of Disney's Marvel offerings was absent from Moon Knight, humor.

The comedic elements that typically make these increasingly generic superhero shows somewhat tolerable was almost non-existent in this show.

Certainly attempts were made to inject mirth, but they failed, which in turn made watching this a very joyless experience.

In the end, all that was left to recommend Moon Knight were the sets and costumes.

Disney does not skimp when it comes to the look of its shows and films, so you do get visual interest.

Still, if I want to look at something pretty, I'd rather spend my time at an art museum where the creations have something Moon Knight sorely lacks: soul.

This latest Marvel series is simply devoid of anything remotely inspiring, which makes for a very sad viewing experience."
9,"I am a huge comic book fan. So finding out Moon Knight was getting a TV show was pretty cool. He was underrated in the marvel universe so I'm glad to see his recognition. The show is more violent let alone more bloody than anything the MCU has put out. And that is awesome to see. The character is funny like he is in the comics and it feels more like a movie than a TV show. The bad guy isn't super exciting but I'm sure as the series goes on he is better. Overall, I haven't been this excited for a marvel TV show since Wandavison."
8,"Was a half-hearted Moon Knight fan. Looking forward to following this series, but just a few things that bug me, especially for a newbie to this character.

First, why label it ""Dissociative identity disorder (DID)?"" Just call it it multiple personalities like everyone else. DC describes it as such in Doom Patrol. This is a TV show, not a course in psychology....so the guy has a couple of personalities. OK

Another bugger for the newbie. I read that Moon Knight was Marvel's equivalency to DC's Batman....and wish it was just as straightforward: Batman is a an iconic genius concept: kid watches parents' murder, creates the vigilante Batman to compensate for the psychological issues springing from this trauma. But nooooooo, Moon Knight's creators went out of their way to create a superhero that is actually the perfect subject for the the current Netflix-type companies that need to sell a half a dozen episodes to stream to entertain the masses, but OK with me.... I am have time...healing a wrenched knee. , good spring /summer fun show."
6,"It's a good premise, but the script was very lacking, and it felt like half a season premiere, they surely did better with Mandalorian and Loki, this was not in that level. We'll have to see how the season develops and I'll update the rating."
6,"After a promising start it seems in the second episode they will try to make fun of as many moments as they get.

Not natural fun of course. But shallow slapstick fun that plagues the mcu.

I'm hoping this will change. It has great potential to be both dark and funny. But keep it natural to the scene."
7,"So far only watched the first episode, and it's looking good.

It starts slow, very slow, but if you hang in there, you'll be rewarded with ever increasing pace in the narrative, including some unique car chase scene, and the first emergence of the Moon Knight.

VERDICT: It looks promising."
2,"Perhaps the series will get better as it progresses, but so far I'm not impressed with the split personality/dissociative disorder of the main character. It's just weird."
7,"I am not a fan of previous Disney+ Marvel shows because for me they were all pretty average but moonknight kept my interest in the first episode. The acting was really good especially from Oscar Issac. The visuals cinematography is also exciting with a good mix of mystery, thrill & horror.

Let's hope they don't mess it up like their previous shows. Looking forward to see more of this."
7,"I don't know anything about Moon Knight, I did not understand most of it but it's interesting and different.

I think the costume should have been less silly.

This doesn't feel like a comic book series more like The Mummy. If you liked The Mummy watch it!"
7,"First episode shows some real promise. Oscar and Ethan come across well and Oscar plays Steven Grant a like a mixture of Ricky Gervais from the Office and Frank Spencer. It's certainly not as formulaic and cliched as some recent Marvel TV offerings, and the dialogue is refreshingly void of the usual claptrap that plague Marvel/Disney stuff. I'll be back for episode 2."
7,"I was expecting more of a serious tone since kevin feige claimed this was going to be the most serious show yet. I was thrown off by how goofy it was which didn't ruin it for me but i feel as if a serious approach woulda worked better. I'm thinking since steven was in control then that's why it was goofy, once marc takes over for good then hopefully it gets better. I like the identity disorder plot but they didn't show any of it, the blacking out and having zero action felt cheap to me. The CGI was also pretty bad but i'm hoping most of the budget went to CGI for the moonknight sequences. It wasn't a strong start but there is potential. Hopefully no more steven cause that got old quick."
10,"I just finished watching the first episode (which was released yesterday), and I can confidently say that this TV series will become a huge hit... I was hesitant at first because Moon Knight is quite different from your typical superhero character, but probably this different flavor will be its strength... Can't wait & see how the plot develops."
10,"Marvel Studios has done it again. Over and over again they constantly and consistently turning out the highest product ever. DC and Warner Bros just can't figure it out. That these shows are more than fights and chases and costumes, It is people. It is being able to identify with the characters. It is even sympathizing with the ""villains."" And it is finding the best people in their fields to help make their shows.

Absolutely amazing. Unlike anything Marvel Studios has done with the MCU so far! The writing! The pacing! The mysteries! The acting!!! So edge of your seat. So intriguing! So Oh-My-God(s in this case) I-Have-To Wait A Week For The Next Episode!!! Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawk were fantastic-but then Marvel has a way of attracted some of the best actors who are alive today. Don't miss this show! It is NOT your typical superhero show. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure what kind of show it is. Don't miss!"
8,"Went into this knowing absolutely nothing about Moon Knight, and was pleasantly surprised!

Intriguing, exciting, Oscar Isaac is a great lead and whilst only episode one is out it's a promising start.

One negative is that whilst it's set in London with a British main character, it's clearly made by someone who has no idea of English culture. Everyone talks like they're Michael Caine and uses British words completely out of context, like saying Cheers instead of goodbye.

Aside that though, great start! My favourite marvel show since Loki, recommend!"
10,This was on ever scale unimaginable amazing perfect plot perfect story flawless it's everything I've wanted and more cast is incredible and cannot wait for more.
7,"It is a puzzle, and each scene progressively gives you a pieve until the final scene has the episode making sense. I honestly have no idea who this character is but the actor (Oscar Isaac) gives a worthy acting performance that had me invested.

I am yet to read the aourcw material, but from what ive seen thus far, this show has so much potential and would have made an awesome Movie.

I follows a confused man with a form of split personality disorder only, one identity is a superheor or anti-hero and he doesnt even know it .

He is fighting for control of his own body and the struggle is shown through how he atruggles to control his own life. He is disfunctional and a mess with no hope but it seems the path laid out before him is unavoidable.

If you are looking for a show that tells a story, i suggest you jump on board.

I can only hope Marvel does not ruin this one as they seem to be unable to help themselves when it comes to ruining TV shows with great potential."
9,This has to be the best marvel tv show they have made i tried watching hawkeye and the others and i could not get past the first episode of any of them but this was funny had good action and good story so i will stick with it as long as they dont screw it up.
3,"There's no easy way to say this, but this is very well filmed and expensive looking schlock.

The excellent acting, production values and investing scenery doesn't help what essentially is a bad story. I'm not talking about the lazy, cliche'd screenplay, but the original material.

I haven't read the comic, and if you told me about it to encourage me to read it, I'd give it a hard pass, so I was reluctant to just dismiss the TV version outright, but he translation to TV medium doesn't improve it.

Sometimes things should stay a comic book."
8,"I'm an old school comic book fan with a huge collection and one of the very few fans of Moon Knight in the world. This series will likely change that.

Although I am a huge comic book historian and collector, Comic books are kind of terrible nowadays especially after Disney bought Marvel. I resent them for that and a million other things. They helped kill off comic books and Disney is pure evil all the time lately. I also dont care for Isaac much for his politics and his bad acting in Disney Star Wars as maybe gay boring pilot guy who we cant say is gay cuz China would get mad.

Anyways, all that considered, I still loved this episode which I pirated from Walt Disney the way he pirated German memorabilia. Things looked so bleak for any Disney MCU stuff post Avengers and I never really liked any of their TV shows. Agents of Shield started off strong the first few seasons then lost me, and I watched Cage for like 7 episodes. Daredevil seemed OK but didn't hook me. Loki was OK I guess, I like weird cosmic Marvel comics. Did one season of Legion mostly for Aubrey Plaza. Plain disliked everything else, but as a comics lover I have to at least look at all this stuff. Moon Knight has potential to be their best TV show ever and I think it could work even if people aren't super into superheroes. Best first episode they've done at Disney Marvel. Loved the way they handled the character, kind of introducing him backwards to a new audience. As a comics nerd it works perfect but it should be pretty trippy for normal folks too. Excited to see where it goes when the next stream comes up. Hope it holds up and gets even weirder with the split personality aspects. The two leads did a great job here too, I like how it focused mostly on them and didn't boggle it up with too much side mess. If somebody who despises modern Disney as much as me can admit its good, you'll probably dig it more."
9,"Like with other TV shows, I will adjust the rating as the show progresses.

This being out of the way, I really like the show so far. I am not familiar with the Moon Knight comic character, therefore I can have a fresh perspective. Unlike others here I don't have an issue with missing profanity or Isaac's British accent. I think both the writers and Isaac are doing a pretty good job. Also the director is dong a great job in visually telling the story.

Really looking forward where this show is going. It has some Venom vibes, just better."
9,"In terms of conception, talent, writing, cinematography, originality and sheer chutzpah, this is the best Marvel character put on the screen since Daredevil. Oscar Isaac is spectacular as he carries the first episode single handedly. Marvel steps beyond the spandex wrestling into new realms of mythical storytelling, first with The Eternals and now with Moon Knight. It had to happen as it gives much needed new life to the superhero genre. Give us more!"
9,"Honestly, Moon Knight could be it's own set of movies but I have a feeling a series will do more than justice for the character. I am glad the show has a more mature approach to the story telling, there's less hand holding at least from what I could tell in Episode 1 and that's a good thing! Looking forward to the rest of the series!"
8,"I'm hesitant about where this series will go, but look forward to seeing where it does. That is thanks to Oscar Isaac, who had a terrific first episode.

Split personality is tough to pull off effectively, and also risks one character being much more likeable than the other. Oscar did a good job with Steven, and if they pull of Marc well, then this could be one of Marvels best!

A well executed first episode that has me wanting more!"
10,Finally the plot set ! The foundation is built. Episode is superb in establishing the multiple personality disorder of Steven and his problems. Now from the second episode it will gear up!
7,"Not sure why, but I was expecting a movie. Not a series. I'm glad it's the latter though because there seems to be greater detail with this than I'd ever imagined.

1st episode was back and forth so much. I can only presume there is an elongated back story that will probably take 3 episodes to get a flow going.

As a non comic book addict. I have entered this adventure wide eyed and without expectation.

So far so good. I'll give it a shot for its outstanding production aesthetics alone."
9,"Moon Knight delivers on superb storytelling, fantastic acting, unique action/dark humor, and more. Oscar Isaac kills it as Moon Knight/Mark, Stephen, Ethan Hawke is a convincingly sinister (pun intended) villain, and the camera angles are just perfect. After the pilot ended I was upset that viewers have to wait a week because it was just that strong of a start to this new MCU series."
7,"Superheroes in Marvel have become like Pasta, they serve you Macaroni, Spaghetti, Cannelloni, Ravioli.. sometimes with Red sauce sometimes Green And White sauce this time around And If you are not a fan You can try the varieties atleast even for a bite of each But imagine you are a fan of pasta you will have it for the whole week happily, can even make it work for a month with different servings But the question is Can You Survive on Pasta and Pasta ONLY FOR A WHOLE YEAR?? The Answer for the Most would be NO!!

So That's how I have been feeling watching some recent Marvel shows and movies and Moon Knight was no different except they gave the protagonist DID. All the Personality Change cuts the mystery they tried to create around the central character felt made up and the supporting characters were nothing new we have already seen Like Sarcastic Boss, Mysterious Ally... even the wits fell flat with the cheeky dialogues.

But I will tell you where Marvel is actually falling short and That is the Villain Section. The Only Villain MCU successfully developed in more than 2 decades is Thanos And that says a lot about Marvel how they are churning on their heroes but it won't be long before getting rejected if they don't start working on their weakness and keep repeating Heroes storyline with cheeky shows like Ms Marvel in cannon.

High Time to Get your Own JOKER marvel!!"
9,"We're only two episodes in and it's brilliant. The only problem I have found is that they are pretending Steven Grant is the ORIGINAL persona as opposed to an adopted one while Marc Spector is the actual persona... technically he has four, including the billionaire who funds their superhero antics. The theatrics are great, the acting by Oscar Isaac is superb, Khonshu is not only done well but pretty comedic. While I know that his character isn't going to be used in the Avengers, it is worth noting that his immortality while being Knoshu's avatar meant that he defeated ALL of the Avengers at one stage... It is a pleasure to watch this."
8,"I have absolutely no prior knowledge of Moon Knight, I'd never heard of it until I saw it on Disney+ and decided to watch, so my review is based solely on the two episodes I've seen.

Firstly it's worth mentioning I'm not a big Marvel fan. My idea of a good superhero instalment would be 'The Boys' - which kind of pokes fun at the superhero franchise (100% recommend).

However I've really enjoyed this so far. Oscar Isaac nails his version of a bumbling British history nerd (voice not dissimilar to Lou, Andy Pipkins carer in Little Britain lol), who is living with two other personalities inside his head and who occasionally take 'control' of him.

Cool concept. Big budget. Interesting characters (well acted) so far. Looking forward to seeing where this goes."
6,"Most of it was pretty mid. Oscar Isaac is great, Ethan Hawke is straight up bad. Some inconsistencies with the writing. Will update as the series goes along but so far it's nothing special."
10,"I was so happy with how they introduced the concept of multiple personalities for Moon Knight. Basically every film or show you see where someone has DID, they're either always aware or we see them go from ""I'm Sally"" straight to ""I'm Bob"". For those unfamiliar with the character, they wouldn't know what's going on until Steven knew what was going on.

What a fresh take.

What's also nice to see is they're not as worried about it being higher-rated in terms of people dying or getting killed with a man's fist, but they're also not going overboard. They're tackling mental illness in a spectacularly insightful way. They're honouring an interesting character who isn't always treated as good in the comic world, and it genuinely doesn't seem as predictable as previous Marvel TV series. Do we know where everything is going? Not yet because they don't want us to. An exciting feeling to have while watching.

Even my dad (+60) keeps telling me how exciting that first episode was. The whole family loves it."
8,"As a lifelong fan of the Moon Knight comic books I was excited to see that they were finally adapting this character for screen, though I was also mildly disappointed by the fact that it was going to be a Disney+ original series instead of a feature length film like I think this character deserves. Though I also understand that Moon Knight is historically not as popular a character as some of the other marvel heroes such as Spider-Man, or Iron Man. So I suppose it makes sense that studio execs would be hesitant to spend the money necessary for a feature length film.

Being an original series aside however, Moon Knight looks much more cinematic than one would usually expect from a show kin to television which was a huge relief to me because I tend to greatly dislike the cheap quality of television in terms of the general look and feel of things. The show has a dark, almost Batman like quality (which I don't think was an accident) and has very snappy, deliberately disjointed editing to really help us get in the head of Steven Grant.

Steven Grant is a troubled individual who works in a kind of natural history museum's gift shop. He clearly has a significant interest and nack for Egyption history that his boss refuses to see. Steven also feels the need to tie himself up in bed and take other various precautions because when he falls asleep he tends to wake up in other parts of the world or in awkward confusing situations. This episode is mostly an expository episode where we learn about the character Steven and his alter-ego(s).

Oscar Isaac does a great job portraying this character and looks like he is completely sleep deprived and stressed out all the time. This first episode we only see Isaac play Grant and very briefly play Spectre. These two characters obviously being very different from one another, I'm excited to see how Isaac does transitioning between an innocent and shy gift shop clerk to a ruthless mercenary in future episodes.

Ethan Hawke is in it as well as some kind of cult leader that judges people's characters by what they will be in the future as opposed to who they are in the present or what they have done in the past with dire consequences if being found guilty. Again, this opens up some doors to interesting moral questions that can be addressed in future episodes. Is this minority-report-esque future judgment the right thing to pursue? Is it moral to kill baby Hitler? I think this take can certainly go interesting places, especially in a show about a hero of dubious morals such as Moon Knight.

So far the series has plenty of interesting visuals and creative decisions to keep me interested in continuing watching the series. I'm Looking forward to seeing where they take the series in the coming episodes."
9,"Just goes to show how utterly dreadful the SW sequels were that they made him look one dimensional and cheesy. The guy can act, great that everyone gets to see it now. Wonder if Jar Jar Abrahams has bothered watching yet...

Cracking show so far."
10,"First episode was amazing Oscar was the perfect casting role for moon knight,probably the beat first episode for a Disney plus show or for a marvel show."
10,"The confusion, the Horor touch, , the bgm, the scenes, the mystery, everything maintained till end. Thanks Director and Kevin Feige and everyone involved in this series. Waiting for episode 2 eagerly. A must watch."
8,"The execution of this show is garbage. I'm very familiar with the character and while the costume is perfect the way they executed everything else is terrible. Oscar Issac's nebbish choice is beyond cliche. And ""the voice in his head"" sounded like Tom Hardy came in to redo his Venom voice overs. It's Khonshu an Egyptian God, not Keith David. Maybe it'll get better, but anyone giving this high marks is ignorant to Marvel comics."
4,"I have seen too many products with someone who has multiple personalities and they manifest into the primary character and they are never done well. Too bad, I really like Oscar Isaac."
9,"We all feel like Steven with a V and want to be like Marc dealing with all the crap in the world.

Great action, and character development from the get go. Woo haaa! Yes!"
8,I wasn't familiar with Moon Knight as it is newer a Marvel character but I really enjoyed this first episode. Oscar Issac does an excellent job as he always does to make you care for his character and you experience his confusion and disorientation at it is happening. Good job so far I hope they can keep it up.
6,"This show has been so boring only 2 episodes in so I'm gonna stick around but I was expecting a lot more. It's slow, the fights are hardly ever shown and when they are parts are cut out to make the creatures invisible and him look like an idiot which should be funny but it's really not I mean I thought this would be insane and hilarious but so far it's been slow and boring and with these marvel shows only being 6 episodes slow and boring is not what you want."
6,"Sony made Venom and showed Marvel great ideas. A little violent insanity, in the conscious-subconscious, when subjected to a protagonist, synthesizes beautifully to make an anti-hero, and compels an audience to judge an underdog as an entertaining, rare anomaly, aka, a super hero. Now, Marvel, as with many re-invented DC stories, seeks to monetize a reboot-sort of model. As a lover of Marvel, this is sadly disappointing. But at least I haven't had to see Stan Lee appear as a God in this one...yet...."
9,I've only seen the first episode.. and "gods" damnit am I excited for more. Oscar isaak was born for Oscars. Showing any kind of multiple personalities disorder is an actors dream role. He does a really good job and the show all around is super tight.
8,"What the devil is it? I'm not at all sure, but whatever it is or will be, I'm in! For the first time in a long time I actually had to pay attention. God I hope the rest of the series maintains the openings frenetic pace."
4,"Grade C. Good and bad with this one. This gentleman from Star wars is a good actor and he has good facial expressions so he plays the role well and the cinematography is good however, no other characters have development so it's just him. Either you like him or you don't. Also most importantly... A good movie must have a good villain. That's why""the Batman"" is the best movie out there because of the Riddler and the penguin are amazing. This movie's villains are... Well who knows it's not really clear. That hurts it significantly. Watch this one on a Tuesday night. Save ""the Batman"" for a Saturday night."
10,"After so many tv shows now marvel bring something fire for us.... Moon Knight is bigger than Loki.... Only two greatest shows ever produced by marvel rest of them are crap, garbage for kids level minds."
6,"Has potential, and I want to like it, but if Isaac's British accent is meant to be believable... well it's not Mary Poppins bad, but Disney certainly didn't ask any natives.

Will decide after ep2."
3,"So far basically this series is about as interesting as watching paint dry. The censorship ship that they use and in this particular marvel series eliminate the violence completely, makes this really hard to stay interested. Probably 1 of the worst marvel series I've ever seen but so far but all of them have been bad lately. I feel bad for our future generation to have to weed through all of this garbage marvel crap to find one decent series out there... if it ever comes."
8,"I wasn't looking forward for series but i didn't regret to check it out , it's pretty decent first ep looking forward where story'll go, i guess lots of 1 star reviews are from people who cant aknowledge some events in history xd."
7,Seems to be standard marvel fair. Got good action and some funny bits and I'm sure I'll watch the whole series BUT the CGI is terrible and why is Poe Dameron doing a really bad impression of Ricky Gervais? Even Dick Van Dyke would have cringed at the accent.
5,"Moon knight.

The latests of Disneys MCU mini series.

We open with a slap in the face sing and cliche meet John Doe.

But seriously.

We follow Steven grant a lowly museum worker who beyond his quirky personality lies a dark secret.

We get tossed around scenes with choppy camera work and sudden scene transitions.

But through this we get a half hearted attempt for a story. (Or at least pilot episode)

Pros.

Oscar Issacs performance and line delivery was quite good, and he even had some emotional impact on us as an audience.

We get to see and enjoy some beautiful reflection shots and artistic still frames.

There a reasonable amount of entertainment while watching this episode.

Cons The animation is very poor, and goofy looking.

The writing is cheesy and nonsensical.

Directing is very amateurish.

The villains are cheesy and annoying. Not knowing how to deliver a line, much less know how to move.

The sound quality was rather muffled and difficult to hear throughout. And the music posed as distracting and obnoxious.

All in all it wasn't the worst.

And it's only the first episode.

So for now I'd give it 5.0

I give this film a PG rating for some mild cussing and violence."
10,I see many review of people not love this episode.. it's the first one i think the remaining is awesome ????and the music is very good i can listen it in any time.
8,Watched 1st episode...and after watching it...i want to say that it was an awesome experience watching it...oscar isaac plyed the character of moon knight very well and it looks like he was born to play the character of moon knight... nobody can replace him as moon night..??..in other hand the episode is quite confusing..but i'm damn sure the series will be very impressive in the other episodes... waiting for next episodes.. overall a great start...??
10,"Being completely unfamiliar with this Marvel character and having disliked most of the movies that Oscar Isaac has starred in, sorry Oscar, I didn't think I would like this series. But Oscar Isaac is perfectly cast in this complex lead role. Given the fact that the first episode of this series focuses almost entirely upon Oscar Isaac's lead character, without an exceptional actor this series could not succeed. The casting, writing, direction, production values and CGI are all first-rate, as usual for a Disney+ production. I don't usually given a 10 out of 10 as a rating, but everything about the first episode was executed so well, I think it's deserved. I'm really looking forward to seeing where this character goes, which is precisely what the first episode of a series should accomplish."
10,This series is amazing I love how the character is struggling with his social identity disorder. We can see arguments with Mark Spector and Steven Grant Which amazes me honestly. This series is leading to the supernatural and I am seeing a midnight sounds movie in the Works.
4,"Not much happened in the first episode that made sense to a guy like me not knowing a thing about who Moon knight is.

Maybe it will catch up in the next episodes but so far below average.

I'm a fan of Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke is doing his thing as well so no negative comments on the acting from me.

Hope the next episodes can change my mind but i doubt it."
8,Just finished episode 1. It grabs your attention immediately and makes you question many things! I love the characters and am very interior see what Marc/Steven does when he isn't himself before Moonknight. I can't wait to see more!
7,"It's just watchable, nothing else.... probably (for sure) i wouldn't have watched this if i didn't have oscar isaac it's an ok series, but terribly cliche and predictable oscar shines in everything so the 7 is basically because of him and so far (until now) they haven't put political garbage in the series."
5,"Trailer got me super excited as the cast is fantastic. Felt like they dont respect audience intelligence at all. Dude literally has a smart phone and asks waiter what day it is. Lot of silly things like people with ak standing few feet infront and refuse to shoot him. Lot of shaky cam too.

I looked up the show runner after watching the episode and its the same dude who made fantastic 4. So i guess this answers a lot.

The premise itself is really interesting but 1st episode is a bummer."
6,"I saw the trailer and i said : wow, a new disney marvel serie more ""adult"". Its about time.

The punisher or Daredevil 2.0 ?

I watched 1st episode. I cannot say that i dislike it. Its kinda good. But for adult ? No way. Trailer is deceiving.

My 10yrs old girl asked me if she can watch it and i said yes no problem."
5,"Pretty standard fare here. Isaac's performance is mediocre, Swan's is in the bland side, and supporting cast's grades are nothing to write home about.

The plot is meh, and unoriginal. MK wakes up outside of his bed and can't count for the missed days. Hmmmm... that's it?

Maybe expectations too high."
9,"I love reading other peoples negative reviews of what I believe is fantastic entertainment, unlike most previous marvel properties, this may be a little more cerebral and does not spoon feed you. It's interesting that most marvel fans won't question a multiverse but do question legitimate mental disorders. Cannot wait for the next episode."
10,"If the series maintains the same first episode energy for the rest of the series this can be really one of the best marvel series out there. I enjoyed it and recommend it for everyone to check it out who likes marvel stuff. It can be a good mini series to invest time into for marvel fans and the people who likes mysterious stuff. But again I am not too sure how good the rest of the episodes are to decide what overall rating the series deserves, I am waiting excitedly for future episodes."
1,"If this went any slower it would be in reverse, I can only hope the pace picks up as the series goes on. Acting was sub par to the point I was laughing at them. The voice in his head sounds so much like Venom's I kept thinking about the venom films instead of watching this lol."
6,"I absolutely loved the first episode but also felt a little cheated by the fact we saw most of this episode due to the heavy over-saturation in repetitious trailers from Marvel leading up to todays release.

I am a big fan of Moon Knight, so seeing such a niche yet anticipated character on screen and being already so visually familiar with what unfolded in episode one left me a bit meh yet also yeah!

Being born and bred in London I was biased at first with his accent but found it cute after half an hour and loved the familiar setting of the British Museum.

Was interested in how a gift shop clerk could afford so much living space in Central London on his wage but came to the conclusion Marc pays the rent there.

Mystery solved.

I personally feel the Marvel TV shows are great in their use for cementing their universe and ultimately I'm just happy I'm seeing Moon Knight on screen.

Fair 6/10 to start."
9,"So.... I've been a fan of this character since issue 1 of the comic, he has been pretty much a little known character apart from the odd appearance's in some cartoons. So imagine my delight when I heard that this character was getting his own show and now this show has arrived, I know it's just the first episode but it's brilliant. Oscar Isaac does a great job in my opinion, the build up was excellent and all the Egyptian influences where spot on. Can't wait for the next episode...??"
4,"This is definitely one for the fans of the franchise. If you have not read Moonnight previously you won't have a CLUE what is going on. No flashback scenes, back story etc just straight into chaos.

The trailer looked good but I've just watched the first episode and was left scratching my head.... not a clue.

I'm sorry, I can't get pass the very poor English accent ( big fan of Oscars previously work)."
9,"Great! Story is mysterious and had me locked in. Touches on a very dark element ( mental illness) a character could have, nonetheless a superhero! Well...maybe a superhero. Who knows? But at least it already feels different than other MCU projects. Really curious and excited to see where this goes!"
10,"The acting is amazing, the atmosphere is something completely fresh. Though I do feel as if Marvel Studios is slacking on the CGI. The cgi animations in first Spiderman no way home, Hawkeye, and Moon Knight just looks really sloppy and playdoh ish. I pray that they don't continue this downslope. Because literally the poor FX is the only thing that makes me not want to watch, but once again this is definitely a great show. 10/10 on performance. Again the CGI is just so unrealistic."
4,This is based on the first episode but if this is any indication on what's to come then this is not a good show. Oscar Isaac is good as expected but everything else is bad really bad. The CGI is awful the acting basically non existing from the rest of the cast and there are so many stupid little things in this show that I would expect in a fan film or cheap TV show 20 years ago but not from a Disney prodction with that production value. I feel like its mostly the director to blame here because he had to say "great job this one goes in the show"
9,First episode best Marvel i have seen on TV. Great casting of Oscar Isaac as. Marc Spector...and the inspired idea to bring back Billy Drago from the dead to play. Arthur Harrow. Looking forward to watching the rest.
10,"Away from being An American Egyptian who is hyped up to watch how they'll showcase the old Egyptian heritage through the MCU Lens , I was waiting to watch the very Talented Isac and his amusing performance! I've enjoyed the premier , the way they're making the series events mysterious and slowly showing off fits the bill when it comes to a show based on Ancient Egypt ! Can't wait to see how things will unfold in the upcoming episodes."
9,"I'm only reviewing this series because I think 7.3 is really inaccurate. To rate it so low based on the first episode is ignorant. I think the first episode showed a lot of promise. It was very exciting and was a great set up for many mysteries. I think you should watch this because it has exciting Egyptian mythology paired up with violence and fantasy which makes it an absolute thrill to watch. It is not just an average show, its one with an enticing storyline. The scenes are very beautiful and the direction keeps the watcher on their feet trying to figure out what is going on. This new anti-villain will certainly be a thrilling addition to the MCU."
1,Show was very boring i could not watch till the end i just skipped and skipped..in my opinion Oscar Isaac it's not good choice for moon knight and the CGI is very average and midcore...
8,"We didn't get to see fight scenes ... They just pretended it happened but it never happened... Series would have been cool if they have only Marc Spector persona.... This thing really gonna confuse people...

This is only first episode... I still have faith that show will be good ...

Expected dardevil and punisher type of vibe but this show isn't that... Looks like gotta wait for daredevil s4 ( oh that's gonna be pg 13 , Marvel ruined it

Just hoping show turned out to be good ... Giving 10 stars cause I'm watching Marvel since i was little 4 year kid."
6,"I can't believe all these people are giving the show a 10 off the first episode. Maybe they're bots. Who knows. The first episode was very average. Not very exciting and very little action. The world is not very interesting and the setup seems very unimaginative.

It's also pretty pointless to build an entire episode around the mystery of what's happening to him, when the entire audience knows exactly what is happening to him. Even worse, to double down on this ""mistery"" by cutting out the fight scenes."
6,I had never heard of this character before. The opening episode was full of the usual action and seems like just another formulaic marvel venture. Peacemaker this is not.
4,"It really follows the typical recipe from superheroes movies. It is boring and predictable. Great acting and special effects, but not much more. I will be updating this if I see any improvements."
10,"When the whole world believes that MARVEL is all about making shows & movies for only children then they released MOON KNIGHT, mysterious, intriguing, entertainment with Dark tone, and the ending (ep 1) is so top class that leaves you craving for more. Others should learn from MARVEL on how to keep their audience engaged and add new ones too."
9,"If they can keep this level of quality up it'll be the best disney + show they've done yet and one of the best pieces of marvel content, period. Really strong start with great writing & imagery and already one of the best performances in the whole MCU - Oscar's acting in the steakhouse was incredible, and Ethan hawke is turning in a great performance too. Two S-tier actors clearly giving this their all and not phoning it in at all. AND we have Justin benson and Aaron Moorhead (writers and directors of the great and smart 'The Endless') directing the majority of the rest of the episodes. Way more violent than anything Disney + has done so far which is great. The cinematography and effects were laudable and the score was great and unique also. All that being said, the quality of the show could still drop off a cliff next week, but this episode is a 9.5/10 for me. Thanks for attending my Ted talk."
10,"One minute and thirty seconds in and I thought ""Wow, this is going to be different!"" And it certainly was. It's like the Marvel Universe has started to grow up and reach maturity after all these ?50 years?. Not to be watched whilst eating dinner and definitely not for the squeamish.

I haven't come across Oscar Isaac before but I'm going to check out his other work now, he's well cast here, having to bumble through life with a ""What The Heck!"" expression and then completely change character (no spoilers here!). It certainly held my attention and had some VERY expensive set pieces that made me go WOW! Again. Well done to everyone involved, can't wait for episode two!"
10,"This is a show anyone will be loved by history and comic lovers, it's incredibly engaging and entertaining at the same time, first episode left me in awe! What a plot and the mind puzzling scenarios.

I was overwhelmed trying to keep up with what's happening and I mean that in a good way.

The Cinematography and soundtrack are brilliant and perfectly tailored for such a strong/dark comic adventure.

A true feast for the eye..can't wait for the rest of the season."
10,"This series is the best mcu series so far that are canon to the mcu. The action, is amazing and oscar Isaac is amazing for this role!!!Also it's dark but not like daredevil and the punisher. As more episodes come out this series will become better and better!!!!!"
9,"Based on first episode only, terrific acting from Issacs and a truly original and intriguing storyline. Love Issacs' London accent which is spot on, similar to Trevor from Iron Man 3. Also very grateful to all the other reviewers for pointing out the Armenian genocide. I think most people missed this reference during the show and were probably unaware until so many pointed it out in their reviews of Moon Knight so thanks for highlighting and informing so many of this awful historical event."
10,"Marvel is trying something new and it looks like it is going to work! Go into it expecting to be confused, that is exactly how the show is supposed to feel. It's great!!"
9,"Amazing show, start to finish. Good characters and excellent actors. Oscar Issac was/is great. Can't wait for the next episodes. MARVEL has another huge hit on it's hands. Bravo."
10,"Watched the trailer and thought it might be a gas, and it was! Great fun, and it keeps on giving. The only disappointment was when Steven can here a voice in his flat and my 10 year old daughter said, I hope that's the fish talking"". Marvel you missed an opportunity 8-) Damn good show, watch it!"
1,The MCU died after End Game. This show simply serves to speed up the decay of the Marvel corpse. Surely someone watched it before it was aired?! Surely someone realised the English accent was beyond awful?! They must have known they were putting out one of the worst shows ever made. I laughed when I watched the trailer because of how bad it all was and then I watched out of morbid curiosity. WARNING - this show may cause the viewer brain damage!
10,Didn't except this much from this.....it's one of the best series from marvel.....very nice ?? must watch it waiting for episode 2......I hope they release soon.
2,"This was Disney's chance to finally do something in the tone of the Netflix series but what we got here is just the same old MCU which is now getting tiresome.

Mundane villain bland set pieces and sanitised, these Disney+ series have been a real let down!"
9,"So far I am very intrigued by the first episode. As usual, the MCU does a good job putting these shows on-screen. I'm ready to learn more. I expect to become a fan as we move through each episode. Mostly I am curious as to how he will fit in with the rest of the MCU."
10,"It's about time! Disney finally produced something worth watching. Interesting characters and plot, great music and visuals. So far Wandavision and Loki have been the only good shows and this has been added to that list."
9,"A new marvel series. Moonknight is introduced in mcu. I was impressed by the first episode of the series. It had action and the one thing i love generally at series is that from the first episode we learn the origins of the character and not from the 3rd episode.

Oscaar Isaac was fantastic. The cast even from the first episode made me a good impression. I can't wait for the next episodes."
9,"Happened to catch the first episode while staying at an Airbnb with Disney+. I'm not a colossal Marvel TV follower nor have I seen much of Oscar Isaac before. But this was objectively very engaging if a little gory. As a Brit living in the US I usually deteste people 'doing' a British accent but that was better than the average. The story moves at a good clip, twists, turns and lots of the unexpected. I may get Disney+ to watch the rest of it. Bloody good show."
10,"Great character building from hero to villain, fantastic acting, nice mystery throughout, excellent action and of course special effects.

So far it's everything I could've hoped for."
5,"The production value is there and I like the concept and what they're trying to portray. The acting is good and the writing is adequate but the tone is all wrong.

There is way too much buffoonery and not enough grit."
9,"The show is very good and the Egyptian theme is well done. It's a psychologically intriguing trip with alternate personalities. Each episode explains more and more, yet new questions form as the episodes become more filled.

Thank you, New Rockstars of YouTube, for being the best Cinema Guide for all things marvel. I always have a blast when watching their videos for better context into what I'm getting into!"
9,"Reviews of this don't do the first episode and possibly the season justice,


People saying this is for children, what? NO a guy with a split personality disorder combating he's demons and self worth.


Great acting, another marvel master piece give it a chance."
1,"As other reviewers have mentioned, it's starting off kinda like Venom except less entertaining. If this show improves later on in the season/series, they probably should have released it all at once or like the final season of Money Heist releasing them in 2 parts."
9,A chaotic first episode but super fun and with lots to unpack I definitely looking forward to finding out more in future episodes. May have to brush up on my Egyptian mythology just to see what marvel changes though.
10,I am so glad that this iconic hero just debuted! Oscar Isaac delivers a very well rounded performance in the pilot and I can't wait for more to come! This is a great instalment to the MCU! Way to go Marvel!
10,"Moon knight has been my favourite character from marvel for a long time and I'm happy he's finally getting some recognition, the show and plot are good and the actors, it's dark but not as dark I thought it would be, very excited what they will do with the next 5 episodes but so far it's looking good."
8,"Here comes Marvel! This is a great set up for what seems to be a very intresting series. I already like the dynamic. It's something we haven't seen before. Venom comes close to what they are trying to do. An interesting protagonist and antagonist. Although, yea, the latter seems like the same fodder. Trying to take over the world, for a better world. We seen that. Point is this: They are upping the stakes and giving you a hero, that knows and doesn't know. Streaming on Disney every Wednesday."
10,Bette than xpctd! Woth a watch with good pacing and action. Didn't think I'd like it as I don't usually like Marvel content but so fa so good. Will watch next episode to find out what happens next.
9,"I am truly suprised, i didn't think it would be so nice.

Oscar is perfect for the role. Definitely has horror vibes, the change between his other self is great, hope it does not get ruined. The cult is great."
10,"Still too early for a thorough review. Only comment for now is that the 1st episode is 10/10 quality on all levels: acting, script suspense and originality (psychological, mystical), fundamentals set for a uniquely original superhero. Ticks all the boxes like no one else so far. Maybe not your customary superhero series (at least not yet), but that is exactly what makes it a genius production."
1,"Marvel really has to stick to making movies. This is just what you would expect. Pure cringe. Even this would be an understatement of how boring and stale this show was.

I am a millenial, my cousin is ""gen z"". Neither of us enjoyed a second so i don't think this is a generational issue either."
1,"I like probably three out of four MCU movies and maybe half of the MCU TV shows so far but I found this to be the worst of the bunch.

I don't understand all the 10 reviews. Maybe you need to read the comic book to enjoy this but so far it's terrible on so many levels by brain is rebelling at even having to describe all the ways I did not enjoy this show. The special effects are OK but it seems like these MCU shows are coasting on people adoring them because there is no possible way any MCU show can be less than perfect. I think book of boba fett falls into the stinker category too but at least it had a coherent plot."
2,"At some point I fall asleep and woke up in a different scene. So I totally undersand what the protagonist feels like.

I think this is a narrative style which never tried publicly before."
10,"At least I'm not the only one that thought Moon Knight was going to be a movie lol I did not know it was going to be a show but I'm here for it!

It was a great first episode! I'm already hooked and can't wait to watch the whole series and see where this goes in the MCU! I'm excited!

Now it's about to get real!!!"
10,"Ignore the BS from previous reviewers. This show is AMAZING. Soundtrack - 100%, acting - 100%. People are allowed to enjoy a first episode because they simply loved it."
10,Every time I wake up then I start to break up a super relatable story about Marc and Steven entangled into one persona. This has the potential to be the beat series yet.
10,"I had low expectations for this show, however I was proven wrong and this show is turning out to be better than all other previous Marvel shows done by Disney.

Oscar Isaac once again delivering an amazing performance.

The writers have challenged themselves by making this a different kind of show than what we are used to.

I look forward to see how the next episodes turn out to be."
7,"This is without a doubt the most confusing mcu thing I have ever seen. It is only the intro and the rating will undoubtebly change, but at the moment, I need more because I feel empty."
2,"This will be the last Marvel series I try to watch. It's the same tiresome formula of all other recent Marvel Projects - they introduce you to the new hero who overacts in every scene (not Oscar Isaacs fault he's a damn good actor, just usual Marvel formula) cracking jokes in every line of dialogue, getting into stupid slap stick situations and slowly unveils he's a superhero with a rich detailed past which is completely background to the comediec elements and a hero that no one else in the MCU knew about until he's shoehorned into every other Marvel project in the future.

The CGI is noticeable and looks like it came from the early 2000s, I know it's a TV series but surely a behemoth corporation like Disney can do better.

There's a potential ""villian"" played by Ethan Hawke, probably one of the more bearable characters as he's the only one not doing a stand up act - he runs a military/religious organisation that I guess no other Hero in Marvel can be bothered to deal with - which I'm sure there's a great one line of dialogue explanation to in a later episode.

The suit looks great and some of the action was entertaining but felt slightly rushed - I won't be watching anymore episodes, the preview made the series look more mature and interesting but it's the same old Marvel stuff."
5,"This is more an average show to me after two episodes. Not sure i will last until last episode. Maybe the British accent put me to sleep.

Nothing spectacular for the moment.

I will raise the average note if it gets better..."
5,"I have been looking forward to this for a while. Overall, dont get me wrong, it started off strong and has the potential to be a great mini-mini series. BUT, I dont know what goes through directors heads when they just let the camera person run around. The end product looks terrible. Its hard to concentrate on a couple of elements when the camera is that shaky. PLEASE stop doing this on TV shows and Movies. Its just as bad as having motion sickness.

Probably not the creators issue, I dont know the ins and outs of movie/tv show making but 6 episodes is not a series. Disney+ has a bad habit of making small series and each episode gets shorter and shorter. If it isnt at least 12-15 episodes at 45 minutes or more in length per episode (not including credits) dont bother, just make a movie instead.

Its these small things that can ruin a great show!"
10,"Look I get it that Batman is not cool like moon knight. Accept it and move on. Why so much hate? All the envious DC fans watched the show, had fun, and then came here to give it 1/2 rating out of 10? Grow up kids. Appreciate Good works."
10,I wrote my review before but it's really Funny how people are "triggered" over the truth Lol just saying. The Armenian Genocide happened and you can't deny it.
6,"As great as it is to have a brand new character in the MCU, this show, or at least the first episode, was a miss. Like other reviews state, I was expecting a darker, grittier take on the MCU, like Daredevil, Punisher, or Jessica Jones. However, I felt that the first episode replicated the same style as Capt. And the Winter Soldier and Hawkeye. Endless comedic relief, non-compelling storylines, forgettable villains, and borderline horrendous CGI. Like, probably some of the worst I've seen in any Marvel property.

I'm holding out for future episodes to redeem this one, but I'm afraid it is too late. Disney and Marvel have fallen into yet another cycle of pumping out the same stuff, different characters.

Overall, I would not recommend watching this to anyone looking for a new viewing experience. It is not Daredevil. Indeed it is nowhere remotely close, and I fear nothing will ever come close to replicating that experience.

6/10* for being a new concept, and I like Oscar Isaac."
10,"Why people have rated this show low baffles me! In my opinion, so far, it has the potential to be the best mcu Disney plus series. A more dark addition to the mcu with an interesting character added to the universe. People have gone and seen the Batman (which I thought was a very good film myself) and have now decided that the mcu is dirt, perfectly good start to the show."
9,"Ok first of all, wow this is indeed very different from what marvel usually does, it's classic, fun, thrilling and more! Istg when people said oscar issac was amazing, they meant it he is indeed very good in this! Can't think of someone better than him for this role. The tone is very different and I'm sure people will love it very much!"
3,Well that was rough. Horrible acting. The random background voice was just annoying and cheesy all the way through. Sucks cause I was really excited for this. Being excited for something Marvel doesn't happen much.
10,"Amazing story telling in the first episode, Brilliant acting by oscar isaac ?? And of course I Am liking the Egyptian mythology and overall feel of the show.. Can't wait to see the action sequences of MoonKnight ??"
9,First episode was amazing! I wanted more immediately! I wish would have ATLEAST got 2 episodes released on premiere night! There was so much happening right off the bat and it makes you think. I will be watching til the end! Cant wait!
9,"First off, this episode isn't perfect, it's too fast paced and there isn't enough time to take in everything. But it's one of the most entertaining opening episodes I've ever seen. This is an absolute HOOK that will almost for sure draw you in for the rest of the season. The jarring changes in perspective is one of the most intriguing concepts I've seen executed in the MCU.

This completely drew me in, and while I haven't been satisfied with some of the MCU shows (finales of hawkeye and wandavision, and everything about FATWS) this first episode gives me hope that disney+ can finally pull off a undoubtedly good show."
10,The show is about a person who is suffering from different personalities in different perspective. The show is dark. Oscar Isaacs acting in this show deserves more than an Oscar. Even the Oscar is not enough. Better than Loki. Better than all MCU shows. Moon knight is just awesome and incredible.
10,"Marvel took a dark tone and I'm expecting to live upto the impact created by the first episode. Damn! What a thriller ride till end. Although we knew it's his other personality, the director made it interesting with good screenplay. Oscar is perfect and Ethan giving me creeps. Loved them."
10,"In all honestly, I would have given Moon Knight an 8 but apparently its been unjustly review bombed. I'm basing this review on the first episode which had a really intense elevator scene, which I loved and the show so far reminds me of the Mummy, one of my favourite movies. Love the Egyptian mythology elements. Not completely sold on the english accents though."
10,"One of the best pilot I've ever seen. Great acting, great drama.. I've been captivated from the very beginning til the end.

Look forward to the next episode.

If the remaning 5 episides will be equally entertaining this series would be one epic masterpiece."
10,"Perfect representation of identity disorder. Perfect visual effects , Perfect curiosity development. Haters are making new accounts to downvote the series like they did on attack on titan . Anyway excellent show ."
8,"A very good first episode. It doesn't give much a way, rather keeps you gripped and guessing what is going on.

Also, Oscar Isaac with some tremendous acting!"
10,"This pilot has to be the best pilot I've seen in the MCU.

Without any spoilers, this pilot has blown me away from the acting, tone, mood, and theme. Just mind-blowing!

I strongly suggest you to watch it before commenting on the show-- don't be put off by its promotional material.

Easy 9.5/10!"
10,I've been waiting for Moon Knight with much more anticipation than almost any other Marvel project ... or Disney+ for that matter. It appears to be worth the wait. Oscar Isaacs has impressed; he is clearly invested and his performance thus far may be better than anything he's ever done.
10,"Another win for Marvel and Disney+. Loving the expansion of the MCU. Getting the Mandalorian to play Moon Knight was a real coup!

All those review-bombing just cuz you're mad, get a life. This is definitely another win for Marvel. Can't wait to see what else they do."
5,Marvel seems to have a pattern with developing characters who appear to be adults but for some reason are always to ditzy or stubborn to put 2 and 2 together while reciting cheesy lines and redundant behavior that never supports any progression in the story. Like every episode is 35 min of BS ( character pretends like they haven't received new info from prev episode and continues to run in circles) and then boom last 15 min and all of sudden the story starts to progress for 10 min and we're left with a " cliff hanger" lol if they say so. Also serious continuity issues. First being that they Describe Steven Grant as D. I. D but the only symptom they show is the time loss and an extra personality who never seems to phase in during stress like real D. I. D ( USA of Tara). And what was the reason for the setting being London??? The American actors British accent is terrible and if the story line was going to lead us to Egypt the man could have just been from America working at Smithsonian or actually working at Egyptian museum in Egypt.
9,What a mystery. This isn't the average how the superhero came to be. There is a lot of pieces to put together as a viewer. They did a great job of having you following along with the ride while the story unravels. I wish there was more then one episode available at launch.
10,"The first episode was brilliant, really enjoyed this, it was clever, funny, great action, great acting. Oscar was awesome in this, loved his quirky British accent."
6,"Why does Disney and Marvel suddenly have terrible CGI? That truck scene in episode 1 looked like something out of Spy Kids.

I honestly expect much more from Marvel."
9,"I dont write many reviews but what an opening episode, it had everything from intrigue to action and lots in-between. Issac's does a great job in my opinion of absorbing himself into this split personality role and I can't wait for episode 2. Another Marvel masterstroke so far."
2,"An overhyped tv show with an utterly convoluted and boring plot with little to no entertainment value (except perhaps for those with IQ of 5 year olds).

All releases from marvel's camp of late have been very poor and this one's not an exception either."
8,"As per expectations with marvel.

Really good start Good acting by Steven And waiting for others episodes.

, .............................................. Watch now."
9,"Disney has one up themselves once again. It's only been one episode but dammit that was probably one of the most action packed and well filmed pilots of any show I've ever seen, especially in the marvel series! Such an amazing interesting character and the costume is perfect!"
10,Moonknight in the show is a bit different than the one in the comics but in a good way. The supernatural aspect works really well. There was never a dull moment. Definitely worth a watch. And as a fan of the character I like this version more than the one in comics.
10,"Far far more better than what imagined Better story telling , series just takes it another level of emersiveness. Hope it goes on with same track, i might like a low burner for someone who's used to fast paced show but in my opinion its perfect combination of action comedy mystery 10/10."
10,"Excellent beginning am really excited for the rest.

Oscar Isaac becomes phenomenal.

Excellent acting directing everything exciting story.

I was lost passion in everything movie or TV series but this is the first thing from too long that am really love and waiting for the next episodes."
8,Good start to the story and character. Some good parallels to Venom which could make for a humorous duo in the future. Looking forward to seeing more of this show.
10,I get that there aren't enough episodes to make a full and accurate judgement on the show but that first episode so far was really really good! I love that it was a Marvel show but with a few thriller twists if that makes sense? Love the actors and how they're presenting everything. Love the actors and how they're presenting the characters! Can't wait til the next episode!
10,This is one of the best Web Series in Super hero genre . Isaac Oscar acting is marvelous in every situation you can connect yourself to it. Story is ground Related.
10,"I'm not a marvel fan, I don't like this type of stories, but this looks different.

Different character and different story.

It's tge first time I watch a marvel stuff and say wow, there's a director and he has a voice.

Thank you, Mohamed Diab."
10,"I have no idea how people didn't like this show. Exciting from start to finish, original, and fresh. Haven't been this excited for a show in a while. STEAKE TIME BABY."
8,Going into this show I didn't know alot about the character. This first episode does not have a dull moment in it it's very well thought-out and acted. It's quirky and just entertaining. Truly interested the see where this character goes not looking up any further information as I want to discover it as it goes along.!
10,"Marvel, keep making dark and bloody shows and movies, let the MCU R-Rated era begin! Don't let Disney or idiot Disney parental control people stop you."
10,"The best Marvel series and one of the best superhero series, especially the performance of the Egyptian director, and he sees Egypt in a different and real way."
8,"Ethan Hawke steals the spotlight every time he's on screen. The dual personality aspect of the show was done, great in the first episode. Some of the other Disney plus shows have been a letdown, and marvel fatigue is setting in. This is a wonderful start and I'm excited to see the rest of the show."
10,"Didn't know what to expect. At first I thought this was a movie when I saw the adds. To my surprise it's a show and it's actually pretty good. I'm not a fan of Marvel movies or shows at all, I think they're pretty garbage except for Thor Ragnarok and Loki."
2,"After marvels efforts the last few years I went in with very low expectations.

The show was even worse than what I could ever have imagined. So slow, that accent drove me mad, no action.

I wanted to turn off after 10 minutes."
9,I like what I see so far. It's only the first episode. So hopefully it will get better. Others with bad review give it a break and stop whining until a few more episodes comes out.
4,Show wouldnt be bad if you actually could see the fights and shooting and so on. This is typicall disney and like that i cant watch it. If HBO produced this it would be watchable.
10,"Really enjoyed it. Suspenseful throughout. Excellent work by Disney and the 1st episode is, like many have said, the most intriguing start to an MCU series so far."
9,"Moon Knight is a spectacular series, it's unlike anything you've ever seen from the MCU, as it's not only different, but it's also disconnected from past MCU storytelling while also sharing in the same universe. This is gonna be a wild ride with every upcoming episodes exploring the personalities of Steven and Marc (Oscar Isaac), while also exploring the mythology of Ancient Egypt, and dealing with the villain Arthur Harrow (Ethan Hawke) which is gonna get more interesting as the story progresses."
10,"One of the Best indroundaction ,of super hero series in Marvel, it's Different from Marvel other series ,it based on Marvel comic moon knight charcter."
8,"Granted I've only seen the first episode, but I think this show is setting up fairly decently. I enjoyed the pacing and character development of Steven/Marc, but it didn't feel like the show I thought it was going to be. Nevertheless, I think this show is a solid 8 as of right now. I'll edit this review as time goes on once I get a taste of the filling rather than just witnessing the presentation!"
6,Completely overhyped. Mind numbing. Oscar is a good actor but this is terrible. The dialogue is cheesy and this should have gone the same dark route daredevil did. Sigh.
10,One of the greatest things in the history of marvel television. I enjoy Oscar Isaacs performance as Marc Spector/ Steve. The story line was also amazing and honestly I have watched it over and over again.
10,"Screw these dumb review bombs. The show is after only 1 episode already amazing.

Isaac does an incredible job at portraying both Steven and Marc.

The mental health aspect of the character has been put well in focus.

I am very excited to see where this goes next."
7,"This first episode definetly met it main porpouse delivering a good introduction to the character and making me want more of Isaac's enthralling performance and Moon Knight's appearence. I wasn't expecting that much of action and thrilling in the series prologue, really hope the show maintain that same energy and rhythm until the end."
10,"What a start! Not a single wasted scene or piece of dialogue.

Isaac is captivating and compelling and Hawke is really interesting addition to the mcu.

Oscar Isaac as well - real exciting!

Have high hopes for this one, even if it's in a new direction (as is well needed) for the mcu or if it's not."
10,"Moon knight is the first marvel show I've watched where I'm not really familiar with the character, so I don't really know what to expect. Having said that, Oscar Isaac gives a great performance in the first episode of a man who clearly has issues and doesn't have things together. He's not respected at work, fails in his love life and even his mom won't answer his calls. Worst of all, he evidently has some major sleep walking issues and has had to chain himself to the bed at night so he doesn't go off hurting himself. Turns out it's a little more complicated than just sleep walking. The action is great, the story line is great and there's enough mystery here to keep you looking for the next step.

WandaVision and Loki have been the highlights of Marvel tv for me so far, but both shows took a few episodes to get going and they felt like TV. Moon Knight gets going in the first episode and it really feels like a film. If the next five episodes bring it like the first one did, this is going to be a phenomenal show, maybe the best of all of Marvel TV to date."
10,Just finished watching the first episode and I am very keen for more! Haven't been this excited about a show since Mandalorian and Loki. The theme is really good and I enjoy the way the first episode gives an insight into Steven's life and the kind of man he is. It really helped me empathise with his struggle. I give it 9/10 but rating it 10/10 to help off set the appallingly low ratings from meat heads who just want 100% action and no story.
10,"The most entertaining MCU series so far. With the potential to be iconic.

Oscar Isaac is brilliant at playing an oblivious a British ""gift shopest"" Steven Grant who shares his body with mercenary Marc Specter and manages the situations he faces comedically.

The acting was great, the story is compelling, and the potential to create fun situations is better than all other MCEU series."
9,"For not knowing anything about this character, I am looking forward to the further episodes!! The acting is excellent and the transition from scenes to scenes is a very good pace and easy to understand. I'm so glad to see Oscar Isaac get another chance at a marvel character, he does this one, in my opinion, excellent so far."
1,Good movie if you suffer from sleep disorders. Extremely bad and boring if you don't. Also Oscar Isaac's acting sucked as usual. The most overrated actor ever. Don't waste your money or time.
10,"Great performances, good story.

As usual Marvel have woven together a great story but it is the charisma of the lead performances that really carries this. Really enjoyed it and looking forward to more."
1,Marvel is good with movies and Loki was good but this does not seems worth watching. I hope it gets better but I do not think so. I hope marvel brings better actors and better team for next shows.
10,"I turned it on briefly with the full intention to wait for my family to get home but before I knew it I had watched the whole thing with my mouth open the entire time.

The ""slow parts"" are the best parts. What a character study. I was mesmerized the entire time, the acting is fantastic, and I can't wait to see where the rest of the series goes.

If there was any negative it was the CGI was pretty weak. It draws you out of the moment. Have we not learned from Green Lantern? Give the guy a real cape.

Still might be my favorite Marvel show yet."
10,"Fast paced, unique vision, unraveling mysteries, and interesting history of Egyptian gods!!!

The acting is incredible, and the action sequences are unique. I love how mental health is part of the exploration of the plot.

Highly recommend!!"
1,Go back to cartoons and stop messing around with Star Wars and Marvel Disney. Every thing you did disgrace to the comics. High budget cgi boredom fest.
1,"There is something wrong with this show, and I believe it is horribly directed. I've always loved Moon Knight, but this! NO I'm not going to see the rest of it."
10,I have no idea why people find this slow or tiring. These people are really giving me the impression that they're huge fans of transformers. Oscar Isaac nails the mannerisms of a socially awkward gift shop worker who suffers with DID and the slow burn mystery really works here with an enticing but on the nose soundtrack and Ethan Hawke's character already feels like a compelling villain.
10,Love the Background music and cinematography. Huge shutout to the director. And Don't mind the 1 star rating. They are just trying to defame the show.
6,"I know the character Oscar plays has multiple personalities, obviously spent time on dialect of Steven, just the accent is awful. In this time when actors spend time crafting accents and dialects, apart from that interesting to see if the story telling will get better needed tobe a longer first episode to held with the disassociated personas and story."
4,"From the first episode, I was completely underwhelmed. Dull and devoid of any plot. The CGI was even much more disappointing. It was definitely a waste of time for me."
10,"This is something different than the other marvel shows to date, and we love it. The Mcu is going in a great new direction, moon knight, werewolves, blade, vampires, and marvel zombies, and I love watching it unfold!"
1,Marvel your movies and shows are getting worse and worse or I'm getting older. I watched the first episode without high expectations and was disappointed anyway. The CGI is also getting worse and worse in your movies and shows. The CGI of The New Mutants should be the new standard of your movies and shows.
10,"What an opening episode! Gripped from the first minute, and loved the tone it took. Oscar Isaac's performance was incredible, can't wait to see how the rest will pan out."
10,"This show has been incredibly unique so far, and brave enough to take on centuries-old human rights issues. You'd be doing yourself and the creators, actors, writers and staff a serious injustice by skipping it on the words of the mainstream review rags."
9,"I liked the show while I didn't know anything about the character Moon Knight. That is because I liked the directing of the show especially the transitions, new action scenes, and the suspense built. Mohamed Diab, as an Egyptian himself, did a great job with showing the true cultural aspects of Egypt as the Egyptian songs which were played in the background. These cultural aspects were not captured in any movie or series produced from Hollywood. I also liked the reflection of Cairo opposite London in the introduction credits. I also liked the music written by Egyptian composer Hisham Nazih who is one of the most known and talented Egyptian musician and I wish for him obtaining awards on this music. My favorite characters in the MCU were Iron man and Spider-Man, but I think I will add Moon Knight to them."
10,"Great show, fascinating start. Can't wait to see where this goes next. Incredible cast and directing! Glad to see the depth of both historical and comic book history, the tiny details to readers of the comics, and the tonal shifts throughout. Mystery, adventure, humor, and heart."
10,Just finished episode 1. The Show is very interesting and I love it and I love the characters I think the show grabs your attention immediately and makes you question many things. I can't wait to see more!
10,"Multi-layered characters. Visual imagery. Different tone to previous MCU projects (movies and TV. Disney+ and Netflix). Horror influence. Narrative thematics. Action sequences and the acting alone raises the bar even by Marvel Studios' standards...

MOON KNIGHT feels different to ANYTHING offered in the MCU to date including Iron Man 1, Capt America: Winter Soldier, Netflix Daredevil and WandaVision... opening the gateway to a whole new dimension of its already deeply accomplished cinematic universe.

EMBRACE THE CHAOS!"
10,"This is a really really awesome start of a series, a lot of confusion in the beginning but in the end everything makes sense and it's incredibly well put together. Visuals, as always with Disney, are absolutely stunning.

I cannot believe some reviews are that harsh."
10,"Can't wait for the next episodes. Fantastic acting by Oscar Isaac. Seems perfect for the role. The perfect mix of humor and action, I can see it getting better and better as the season progresses."
1,"Couldn't watch anymore that 15mins ... utter garbage!

It's just terrible, another marvel/Disney spin off junk trying money maker, I couldn't gel with Oscar playing the main character, this accent is terrible and i had to switch off!"
10,"Love Moon Knight. It's been one of my favorite comics for years. Oscar Isaac's portrayal is nothing less than perfect. Love the series, can't wait until Wednesday so I can see the next episode."
10,"I loved every moment of the show! I didn't know anything about it before I started watching and I was enteanced from the beginning.

I can't wait for the next episode."
10,Love the classic horror elements as well as the more accurate representation of mental illness that is rarely seen in the film and video game industry! Also a massive fan of ancient Egypt and it is really awesome to see the more mystical elements of their culture show up in the mcu finally!
10,Totally out of my expectations. Full of surprises. The acting of Oscar is amazing and splendid. Also the moment when he backwards grabbing the scarab really makes me laugh.
10,"I've been waiting for this since Daredevil first hit the Netflix screens years ago.

This is a very exciting series, living up to all the wild ideas of the comics character. Give it a shot."
2,"Boring. Atmosphere and concept copied from DC.

Oscar Isaac is not suitable for this role. His acting is bad The quality of the series is below Marvel standards.

Sadly I have to give it a low rating Waste of time."
10,"Satisfying experience, very good and great cgi I like it, easy to understand plot even though there are still many puzzles.this is very good, especially in a month like this for those who feel bored, this is suitable for watching, I am very happy."
10,Why is everyone on the reviews so full of it?? Like chill you haven't even seen half of it! Im only reviewing the pilot. Which is one of the most interstin g i've seen.
10,"Only in 1 episode it nailed, dying to watch all episodes. Never seen something like this in a series. I like it's Music & background score, just fantastic fits in every scene."
9,The CGI could be improved but the first episode was phenomenal and the acting was unreal for people who are really into mind boggling movie/series I recommend to watch MoonKnight.
10,"I'm very excited for this series! I know nothing about Moonknight but so far it's been a very exciting ride and great television! The acting was great and it had the perfect mix of action, comedy, and horror. Keep it coming!"
10,Always have been a marvel fan. Everything they put out has been amazing. Watched the first episode and i'm already hooked. Can't wait for the next episode.
10,"Great Egyptian Music by Egyptian Singer Najat has been used in Episode 1 , beside the amazing performance of Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke , also the action scenes are so attractive . The story is astonishing and the best of it is to clarify the right face of Egypt and Ancient Egyptian Civilization away of Afrocentric lies , can't wait to see the rest of episodes ."
10,"I really liked the 1st episode and thinks it sets up great for subsequent episodes. Oscar Isaac's performance was spectacular. The show motivated me to do some digging on the comic character of moon knight.

Hopefully after this successful season, we'll get at least one more season!"
10,"My Daughter & I love complicated Mental Comic Heroes, especially when the storyline gives thought to real life past present & future, like Deadpool without the excessive Ryan Reynolds humor (which becomes distracting).

Oscar Isaac is great. Please keep going."
8,"Enjoyed the story and the action so much. Oscar Issac is great as well, it's cool to see a series that finally references the Egyptian pantheon. It's totally worth a watch."
8,"I just watched 1st episode of #Moon_Knight, In the first episode of the series, we have been shown that #Steven, who is a common man working in a museum, but what happens to him is not normal at all.

In the beginning itself, Makers develop a good bond with the main character of the series, which is a very good thing.

In some scenes, the use of a green screen is visible, the CG characters do not look as we expect from a #MarvelStudios series."
10,"As an Egyptian this work encapsulates the essence of the country just by listening to the soundtracks from the old classical music to the ""sha3by"" which represents part of the present music, all of this while also being true to the comics as needed... can't wait to see the rest which will be in Egypt."
10,10 on 10 for me. Oscar isaac is lit ??. Though i know liking is subjective but seeing the rough thrashing here i wonder whether this reviewers are from rival companies.
5,"Not so bad, but not so good also. Oscar Isaac is awesome but nothing notable happens here. I think we need more explanations to say more precisely, but this first episode is confusing."
1,The plot was weird and incoherent. Hopefully the next episode will bring it all together. I'm reserving jugement fort two or three more episodes. It could develop into something interesting.
9,"People are giving too much hate for the first episode?? I found it really good. Oscar Isac is amazing in the rule, so much details,easter eggs and Mohamed Diab put an amazing egyptian touch in it and i loved it. Hope the series gets better and better, so far the best opening episode for any mcu series for now."
10,"A really good show, not just in marvel shows. It depicts the story in an interesting way which makes you question whether or not what you are watching is true to the story or just Steven's dreams. People review bombing it over a throwaway line of dialogue can suck my PP."
10,"Great start for me, I love every bit of it. The costumes, the Egyptian gods and historical references are tools the audience should fancy. Still haven't decided who my favorite character is though, might end up been Ethan Hawke's Arthur ;). I think the MCU phase 4 is taking shape beautifully, so yea, definitely screen-worthy! Marvel always has beautiful cinematography??."
10,"This was amazing..........

i have just finished the first episode,

The Best Tv Mini Series i have ever seen, I guess 'Oscar Isaac' born to play this role."
10,"What the Movie?????? i'm Freaking Out 1st episode was incredible. I can't wait 2nd Episode. BTW Oscar Isaac One of the Best Actor in the world. He's Emotions and his British accent and Whole episode is Burning. We can't find This Kind Of Series from DC????. I rated 10/10 Dang Whatta Movie Thank You Marvel, Thank You Disney. We can't wait next Episodes."
10,"Great series. Oscar Isaac is an amazing actor and I hope this series has a long run. A huge step forward for Disney plus. Great acting, great plot, great writing and cinematography. Can't wait to see what comes next."
8,"It was a good start! I'm watching from social media but I really like it! It's good you can watch you will enjoy!

The main actor could be better cause sometimes, He's no develop more confidence.

In general its good!"
10,"I remember reading comic books about Moon knight and loving the character, when I saw fight club, and Split and Me Myself, and Irene, I thought that if they do something something like this for the character form the comics I would be satisfied, but they do something a little be different that I find more intriguing, suffices to say I love this show already and I can't wait to see what they have in store."
9,Episode was smooth having horror vibes with comedic touch. Oscar's acting was Legit for some parts .I think the next episode needs to reveal the Character even more further.
10,I believe Moon Knight will be a great darker side of Marvel. I wish there was more Moon Knight costume and blood in the show. I was able to watch this with my children which was a plus. This show doesn't connect directly with the Universe at the moment but I can see a bridge with X-men soon.
10,"Great start to the show, can't wait to see where it goes. Moon Knight will be a great addition to the Marvel universe. Acting was great and it has a different feel than the other marvel shows we've seen."
10,"As a regular people I really like Moonkhinght first episode the plot, the CGI and Oscar isaac are amazing!! Can't wait for another episode. Great Show Marvel."
10,This series not miss you too much watch. Outstanding this series one of the best series in MCU Moon Knight is not copy batman Moon Knight is feature brand new world ??
10,"Loved the first episode. The transition between Steven and Marc were amazin, they always left a mystery. The first episode was the best introduction to the plot in any series ever. I think this will be the best Marvel production ever, even better than Avengers Endgame and Spider-man No Way Home."
10,"The only negative thing I can say about this new show is that I can't binge watch the episodes... I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE!!

Oscar Isaac is a STELLAR actor and I love seeing him in all of his most recent projects movies/shows etc. That are available on multiple streaming channels. He's been around for so long and I love that he is evolving into such an amazing actor . I especially love the fact that he is never type casted . You can't tell his ethnicity, which I find to be something that helps any actors' career . It keeps your options open . And he definitely proves that on screen . I give MOONKNIGHT ??? ???????? Two THUMBS UP another awesome project under Oscar Isaac's belt ."
10,I felt like this show got off to a great start and I was sitting at like an 8-9/10 but then when they mentioned the Armenian Genocide and pissed off a bunch of history-denying idiots it boosted it to a 10/10.
10,"Mind Blowing Series The Action, Story, Realistic Amazing And Mind Blowing Series

The Actor.... His Acting Such a Genius

I'll Really Love It Thank You Marvel Comics ......"
10,"Ignore the negative reviews from those triggered over a reference to the Armenian genocide, which did happen and was a war crime. Do yourself a favor and watch this show!"
10,Great first episode! This episode left me wanting so much more. Cant wait to see the rest. The soundtrack is great also. Oscar Isaac is doing an amazing job with this role. Ethan Hawke looks scary.
10,One of the Best from Marvel till now. Love the work of Marc Spector and all the characters. The Comics and the characters in the series are really awesome.
10,"A different and mysterious start to an MCU series, amazing! Oscar Isaac is brilliant in the role, Ethan Hawke has the potential to be a villain that even the viewer respects and fears him, which in my opinion, the other shows on D+ have failed to deliver."
10,"Unlike any other Marvel series. Well written, acted and directed. Oscar Isaac is terrific as Marvel's foremost MPD hero. You don't need to be at all familiar with him to thoroughly enjoy it."
10,"The first episode of 'Moon Knight' was released on Wednesday, and I think from having seen it that it is pure masterpiece, CGI level it was incredible more the story Is so faithful to the comic itself which makes it more enjoyable to watch."
10,This is amazing The transaction of Stephen Grant to Mark Spector (MOON KNIGHT) is awesome and the darkness of the movie reminds me DAREDEVIL. And i think this is the best Pg-13 MARVEL series ever..
9,Moon knight so dark but I expect is unbelievable.oscar Isaac amazing acting. I wait for 2nd episode. In episode curious and the final the moon knight appear.
10,I just finished watching the episode and wow! The best first episode of a marvel show imo. Marvel aced this one in my book. Can't wait to watch the rest. Cheers.
10,Interesting story line and very well performed looking forward to see more. Bravo Oscar Isaac is real good. Everytime I watch something from marvel always thought this is best one so far but they always surprise with another brilliant superhero Moonknight is definitely going to super hit must watch. Find it really interesting to see another culture represented in Marvel Universe thats way they are best.
10,"It's a great show And at the begging I like how we start we the perspective of Steven very good love Oscar Oscar. His acting is amazing.it so far better than any other Disney plus show so far, I hope it continues to be this great.hope more character like mid knight interact with Moonknight soon."
10,Very cool the best marvel show in my opinion yes it is better than daredevi and punisher it not as dark as but very good shown and some pepole say it is bad not as dark as they expected but this is show is dark again not as dark as punisher or daredevil but it is darken than anything that come out in mcu.
10,"From a huge 2015 Daredevil fan here, this show was very similar to the feelings had there. Very good, amazing cinema all around. Shots were perfect and dialogue amazing. So well done."
8,"I'm reserving judgment on Moon Knight until I see more of the season. But wow, it is just such a relief to watch a Marvel show that isn't spending at least 30% of its time making references and seeding connections to other parts of franchise."
10,This is by far the greatest first episode of a Disney Plus Marvel Show we have seen. The way the chronological order weaves in and out of time is incredible and the cinematography is outstanding. The director and writes for this show are top notch and you can tell. Steven is such a lovable character with actual funny humor unlike other Marvel shows. I can't wait to see the next 5 episodes!
9,Loved this episode and am excited with the direction in which it's going. Isaac's performance was strong and it will be interesting to see how the rest of the series plays out. The vibe felt a lot different than all the other marvel series' so far - which was good to see!
9,"Wonderful show catches the comics, in real life . Some differences but it's bringing my childhood to life. It's a bit confusing for some watchers but hang in there it's got a lot to come."
10,Best pilot episode for Disney plus show.. Engaging screenplay.. Background scores are awesome...oscar nailed his performance by playing different personality characters.
1,This has to be the most boring and dumb Marvel series ever. Didn't keep me interested. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. Different casting and a better storylines would probably fix it. They should try to do longer episodes or release at least two episodes. The way the guy keeps blacking out and we don't even see what's happening is the most dumbest thing. Sorry! You lost a viewer and I would be returning. The way it's set it London and can't understand a word from those accents...
3,"Oscar Isaac may be the worst actor ever. I dont know what they were thinking when they chose him. Overall quality is also just terrible. It is like the worst director and worst leading cast magically found each other.

It was like a torture to watch this. Dialogues were lame and stupid, narrative was like a 7 year old wrote it.

I need to clean my eyes and my ears with bleach. I know things have been going bad in this sector but I didnt expect such a major screw up."
1,"Worst Marvel cinematic creation ever. I was waiting for this for so long and it's very disappointing. I can understand why this couldn't be a movie and just tv series. Imagine worst marvel movie ever, now multiply it buy 100. Not interesting, not cinematically impressing ... just nothing. As i said go wash your washing machine it's much better."
2,"Waste of time. My time is precious for this serial. There's no need. There are much better movies.you watched them. The script of the series is made up, not original, boring."
9,"I must say that I get the impression that many people just want to not be impressed. That doesnt make them smart. They are so quick to say that something is bad. But their reviews are the ones that are often bad - lazy and short, no insights at all. Why should I care that someone I dont know said just that they dont like something?

So I will try to be useful. First of all, I liked this show a lot hahaha.

English accent is so bad that it was funny to me. It sounded kinda correct and totally wrong at the same time. It is forgivable because this is basically a cartoon, not Bergman. But apart from that, this was super fun first episode. I dont like superhero shows normally (though I watch them all), but this one seemed intelligent, maybe a little clumsy, but the thing that I liked the most was that I was surprised by the fact that I wasnt annoyed at all by the way this show plays with viewers curiosity. Most of the time the sense of mystery in any show is so badly coordinated that it becomes frustrating (I mean LOST, what a insult) but not here. Not for now. We will see, this could be just super."
3,"I really got bored watching it. Normally, I get excited about watching superhero movies. But I was really bored with this movie. I'm glad it's at least separate from the mcu universe."
10,Can't wait for the next episode! Great start to what seems to be an amazing show. Oscar Isaac seems perfect for the role and I can't wait for more in depth fight scenes.
10,Main actor is great! Love the actor who plays Steven! I only watched episode 1 so far and can't get enough! Can't wait for more! I don't know much about the character from comics but the show did a great job at explaining it to new people.
2,"What a waste... below average, quite a disappointment. Also, conflicting statements. I don't go and watch something to witness your political games. Marginalizing a certain group of people, putting them on the target, these aren't nice things.

""Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past""

It's like a pathetic attempt of ego masturbation. Did it even succeed? I don't think so."
10,"Amazing start to an incredibly different feeling Marvel project. Equipped with the classic MCU charm and wit, this project isn't too fearful to step into the supernatural world of horror with the use of clever camera techniques. Some people have complained about the main characters accent, and that's a quite silly criticism since captions are available. He's really not that hard to understand. Overall, this show will be incredibly captivating for any fans of Egyptian mythology, fans of horror, any interested in DID or other mental health afflictions, or anyone just dying for a Moon Knight story. This one is the show for you."
10,"Fascinating, fun, crazy.

First episode starts with a bang and really steeps us into this world of mystery and action.

I've always loved Moon Knight as a Marvel character but this show takes him to new heights. Love love love."
9,Oscar Issac is a great Steven grant/Marc Spector. This is our first MCU appearance of Moon Knight and he makes you feel really bad for him great acting with the Split personality.
10,"The Armenian Genocide happened. Those people review bombing are awful. I hope this leads to MORE people learning about the horrific Armenian Genocide. I encourage everyone to educate themselves about this terrible, historic and true event.

Moon Knight is a great show. Love it. Only the first episode out so far, but probably the best first episode out of all the marvel shows? At least in my opinion. It's darker and feels more horror-esq than everything else in the MCU. Oscar Isaac is awesome. 10/10."
10,"Don't listen to these other people review bombing this show, this show is amazing and has more to offer. These people review bombing are the same people that wants a bright and happy show like every other MCU show, they are mad this is different."
10,"As a fan of the comics I always wondered how we would see moon knight cross over to the screen and honestly I'm incredibly impressed. Oscar was the perfect choice and brings a unique innocence to Steven and I can't wait to see the longer action sequences he has as Marc. The show does an amazing job on highlighting the loss of control and confusion between Steve and his DID counterparts. And the added message about mental health support at the end of the episode was a nice touch on disneys part.

The cinematography is amazing, the humour is the perfect amount and I can see this show only getting better. My only qualm was that one episode wasn't enough to quench our thirst. We really went on a journey with this episode and I hope we know what happened to gus soon!"
10,"Great to see Marvel going in a different direction for this show compared to the others. As the MCU continues to grow, variety is what keeps things fresh."
9,"The first episode was so trippy, and full of surprises.

I'm an old Moon knight reader and even with the changes on the character I enjoy the ep so much I'm looking for the next episode."
10,I don't know much about Moon Knight other then what my boyfriend has taught me about this character. I love how they are showing how someone with D. I. D can forget what they have done. I can't wait to see what they do with this character.
10,"Having watched all Marvel products this origin story was very intriguing. So far Wandavision and Loki have both been top rated. The potential in moon knight is clear, in both story telling and action.

Having the story half told and potentially swerves to come I can't wait to see the progression of this."
10,Don't listen to negative haters the show was great and I'm sure it's only going to get better. When the character emerges I stood up and cheered and I'm a lifelong moonknight fan for 40 years.
8,Not a genre/subgenre that typically interests me but I have some old Marvel nostalgia that brings me back once in a while. This is really well done from the writing to the atmosphere of the setting and way the story is being portrayed. Pretty neat and unexpected.
10,"Probably the best first episode from a marvel tv show. It's mysterious, funny, and the action is great. Episode 1 is a definite 9/10 on IMDb scale. Review bombers are ruining the score however because of a mention of the Armenian genocide, which is really lame of them.

Excited for more Oscar Isaac!"
9,"I loved the first episode. I like rage character development and how it flowed to the ending. Can't wait for next episode. Wish they would have put all episodes out, then I could have binged it all."
10,Love that they moved this story out of NY. (How many heroes does one city need). Oscar Isaac is amazing as usual! Special affects are clean and the suit is "chef's kiss"
10,"Awesome first episode, cannot wait to see where Oscar Isaac goes with this. Pacing is good, cinematography is on point. A nice departure from usual Marvel Disney stuff."
10,"I have been really excited for Moon Knight to finally come out and it definitely lived up to the hype. I didn't know anything about the comics but I would watch all the YouTube podcasts about it to try and figure out what to expect. I am definitely a Moon Knight fan now! I love the mental health dynamic and Oscar Isaac is absolutely amazing in the show, such an amazing casting job once again by Kevin Feige and Marvel. Ethan Hawke is such an amazing addition to the Marvel family as well. I can't wait for episode 2!!! Everyone else are just bitter haters that can't find joy in anything."
9,What an amazing episode filled with possibilities. I can't wait to see what they will do with Marc Spector! Highly recommend this title. The Cupcake truck scene alone!
10,"I like the way they changed Steven grant from the comics. The cgi at times is bad and I can only hope for them to include Jake lockley, but I doubt it."
10,"Absolute blast. Excellent and intriguing performances by Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke, very fun and well-crafted action, can't wait to see where they go from here.

(also the Armenian genocide is real, cry harder psychos)"
8,"Great acting, writing, direction, cinematography, action, music , post production, etc. It's big budget quality feeing throughout. Also, feels more elevated in storytelling from your typical cut and paste Marvell production. Just the 1st ep but if they keep this up, it should be really good. Now someone please save the Star Wars franchise! (Ughhh Boba Fett should have been completely scrapped. So sad.)"
1,"We got it in the first 5 minute, no need for 45 minute of nothing to present the character.

This feel like an other Cloak & Dagger. You wanna know more, but there nothing more."
10,"Yes, it's not perfect, yes it is another marvel show, but yes it's exciting and fun. It's entertaining and its done well, the music is great, and the acting is fantastic. It's early on, but the first episode really was so good. I think we forget what things like this are, entertainment. If it's good at that I'm fine with it."
10,"I was really scared when Disney bought Marvel, even more so when Stan Passed. I thought they would be softening/toning down the mcu for their family freindly streaming services. They did NOT! This is dark, as it should be. Over the course of the new shows I feel like they are doing Marvel and Stan proud. Can't wait to see the next episodes."
10,"I loved it. It is so much different than any hero movie or series. Very captivating it's pace is very good. I am hooked now waiting for what's next.

I hope it pictures Egyptian history close to reality."
10,"I enjoyed the show from the beginning till the end. Great scenes, great casting. Recommend watching it! 10/10 !

Interesting story! Oscar Isaac play is amazing!"
10,Its amizing.so good and its good that we will see the realy egypt in it and how great it is has a good story i hope its contnue in that gratnes and muhamed deab did a good jop.
10,"Can't wait for the next episode this show is great and Easter eggs are all over with free comics via QR codes in the show, stop review bombing this show for the dumbest reasons get a life and stop messing up the experience for everyone els just shut it and move along."
9,Extremely captivating and entertaining. Highly recommend you watch this fabulous piece of entertainment. Thank you for listening to my opinion. Cheers.
10,"After the first episode you already know this is going go be a wild show. The first episode already foreshadows how dark, sinister and wild this series is going to be. All the episodes after this are going to shock us. Great pacing and great acting so far. Can't get much worse than this."
10,"I loved this, but I really wanted to balance out the Review Bombs. Marvel has gotten this to a good start. I hope they wind up using all of the mental health issues that come out as the character has grown in the comics."
10,I personally think that this show's pilot episode does a great job delineating from the traditional MCU shows and highlights the more grounded and gritty aspects of the weird side of the MCU. Looking forward to where they take it from here!
10,"This is probably the most strongest introduction in mcu tv show, the build up of marc and steven characters is really engaging and interesting, and that ending was phenomenal."
9,"For a show about a jewish superhero with mental health issues i did not expect it to be my cuppa tea. But let me tell you its dark, its gritty and the mysteries keep you guessing. Sort of reminds me of Daredevil season 1 on netflix crossed with Wandavision. Cant wait for the rest of this series. Oscar is portraying this hero super well. I suggest this as a must watch for any marvel or superhero fans out there."
2,"Overacting of Oscar Isaac made this series pretty bad.

I was excited and waited for a long time to watch this show but I am very disappointed in the cheesy story and also how Oscar Isaac acted. As a Disney plus fan they keep lowering the bar with almost new release but this one is a total fiasco."
10,"It's amazing how one line From a TV show cam throw a group of people into a frenzy. Moon Knight's first episode was a fun, exciting, and interesting bit of TV. The action was fast paced, dialogue was well written and I throughly enjoyed. I know what I am getting when I watch a DC or Marvel project. It's just fun.... I was born in the sixties. Original Batman and Robin, Superfriends on Saturday morning, Christopher Reeves in Superman. I grew up reading all these comics. I love all the shows and movies cause it takes me back to laying around reading these heroes.

I am mystified that a mention of an historical event has caused so much backlash. You cannot sweep those things under and bury your heads. IMHO concentrate on real world problems and not on a tv show that accurately ""mentions"" in passing something that happened over 100 years ago. Plus the German people did not come out and criticize the show for mention Hitler."
10,"Great start to what I hope will be a great series. I'm not familiar with the comic's version of Moon Knight, but I have learned a bit in anticipation of this show coming out. Over all, I loved the show and can't wait to see where it goes."
10,Enjoyed from start to end. I hope the energy continues. Some accurate historic facts too that not too many movies have courage to do so.......love Oscar Isaac.
10,"This is my first review on IMDB but I just had to share how great this show is so far! The writing is well executed and the visuals are stunning! As a super hero fan in general but knowing nothing about Moon Knight before starting this, I was hooked immediately. The way they introduce the character to you is unlike any other I've seen. If you enjoy the super hero genre this is a must check out!"
10,"Oscar Issac does a great British accent, I'm English so I am good judge of that and not dumbasses who think we all talk like cockneys. Great story and effect, people with stupid motives are giving this movie bad reviews on here, like grow up people."
10,Very good for 1st episode. Hope to be a more seasons. Like it how give you a glimpse of the Egyptian mythology. Good actor let's see how evolve. This should be a short review but I have to fill it out with at least 150 character. So I like it.
10,"I enjoyed the first episode. I think it has real potential. Oscar Isaacs is always enjoyable to watch in my opinion. Plus, Ethan Hawke? That's a solid cast, baby. But really I'm giving it 10/10 because of all the clowns giving it 1 star, not because of the actual content of the show, but because they are in denial about something that so clearly happened and they want the world to pretend to be just as delusional as they are."
10,"Moon knights debut is finally out and being a huge fan of moon knight they really nailed it. Oscar Issac is incredible, and the mysterious plot that leaves viewers confused as the story will be told on and completed as the show goes on is a great way to plan a show. Overall I can't wait for the next 5 episodes and see where he will end up in the MCU."
9,"With a first episode that efficiently fills the audience in on key characters and their personalities as well as sets up a unique storytelling style hits home to set up the confusion that the protagonist of Steven lives in day to day. Similarly to audience, he has no idea what's happening and must navigate through confusing scenarios to begin to find the answers. I for one have been reading Moon Knight comics for around 3 1/2 years now. This show reinvents the character and powers in a very interesting way and I am excited to see it unfold. I look forward to more expert storytelling from future episodes hope Moon Knight is here to stay."
10,"A great movie, very impressive, based on true stories, remarkable . Me and my family watched with pleasure .

Can't wait to watch it again ! I recommend to watch it everyone! ??"
9,"As a Marvel fan, obviously I was excited for this series from the very start.. At first the story may seem a little confusing but once you get a good hold of it, you'll see the unique story of Moon Knight. Loved the first episode. Starting and the ending of the episode was really good."
10,"Even though it's the first episode, it's pretty good. I'm looking forward to the other parts. One of Marvel's best shows. Especially Oscar Isaac is great at acting."
10,"This is what i wanted from moon knight series, it's unexpected and the duality between marc and steven is interesting. And what a powerful scene that ending was."
10,Amazing movie really enjoyed it! Highly recommend everyone to watch this! Disney thank you for making truly great movies! May this continue! Fantastic!
10,"Great movie, loved every bit of it. Marvel is not usually my favourite but this one was epic so happy they mad this movie.

Great work and continue your great work ???????? Thank you Disney this was the best you have ever made."
8,"If Marvel has more of this in store then phase 4 is going to be fantastic.

Performances were note worthy, the story line was well layed out so easy to follow and the dialog had realism.

With such a great first outing for this new character I am interested to see the following episodes direction."
10,Excited to see the rest! A very good job on portraying a unique and complex character. Oscar Isaac is obviously incredible. The archaeological background is also very interesting and provides a nice backdrop to the story.
10,"I wasn't too sure about this show at first I watched the trailer and I didn't know the characters or the actors too well , so I wasn't too excited to watch it. When I finally did check it out I absolutely loved it Oscar Isaac is great. I like how the story is pretty original it isn't just the same old superhero movie Its something else. It has only been one episode so I guess we will see if the show keeps me interested."
10,"First episode was very good. Great production and story line. I'm really looking forward to this series, moon Knight looks more promising than some of the other Marvel series (ex the disappointing Falcon -Winter Soldier) Moon Knight is well done !!"
10,Hook of the opening episode was good enough to keep invested in something I knew nothing about. Waiting for more. Great acting and direction. Oscar Isaac plays a great lead.
10,"Good acting and action, didn't know much about the caracter but loving it si far. Waiting for the second episode. My wife is not a fan of super hereo movies or tv and she loved it."
10,"This being it's first episode it begins with that perfect tone of the lead being thrown into a number of harrowing situations that he has no idea why or what is happening ?????? It's a classic fish out of water scenario that really drives this first episode!

I really loved it and cannot wait for the second episode!"
9,"So sad to see so many people with their heads up their proverbial and getting so upset about one line because they deny a moment of history the world knows it's true but they are too embarrassed to believe. Coming onto this site to downgrade is just pathetic. I enjoyed to first episode. I think it's going to get really intresting. If the turks don't like it, who cares. LOL."
1,"Not that great honestly......who cares about this character? Marvel is losing it...they peaked at Endgame All their shows and movies are for kids anyways

Can the real Batman please stand up...."
9,"Its a very good start, first episode is so interesting and drive you into soo many randomness and thrilling story.

I love it and i have high expectations for it."
10,I remember very little of the comic from when I was a kid but Oscar Isaac does an awesome performance. Just the story and the acting is worth watching .
10,Great foundation to start the series. I was stoked for this to come out and Im not disappointed. I have a feeling people will come to love this hero as they did Shang Chi. Looking forward to the next 5.
9,"In the first episode, we see almost everything we should expect in the show, Someone who's mind is shattered into two people, a more serious, multiple people get killed off screen and we see blood all over Isaac's hand, and we know just as much about what's going on as Steven Grant (Oscar Issac) does.

I am looking forward to the rest of the show."
10,If you hate the MCU's commodified and referential narrative and plot writing style then you need to watch Moon Knight. This show is almost a complete antithesis to marvel movie's need to reference continuity and iconic characters. This is a tale of a mentally ill man struggling to become an ultimate hero against all odds.
9,"Went into watching this with differing opinions of what to expect, would it be standard marvel fare or something new, in those terms they've knocked the ball outta of the park it's Marvel But Different, Issac's take on the characters accent not included is brilliant as is Hawkes baddie especially the opening 30secs, they've managed to do the transitions to the different personas neatly without making it confusing, I only hope that the rest of the season can keep this up."
10,Was worried about the English accent from Isaac but he pulls it off and sets up an intruiging beginning to what promises to be another hit Marvel. Ethan Hawke is an underated and under used actor so looking forward to seeing him play the 'bad guy'
10,It's only 1 episode and already time can't move fast enough to see the next. There an no shows that have the same type of production like Disney puts on.
10,"I loved the opening episode of this new Marvel limited series, its amazing! Not at all what I was expecting and very pleasantly surprised! Oscar Issac is great in this role, although I do have some difficulty understanding his accent, and Ethan Hawke is a brilliant addition to this cast of characters. I don't know the backstory on any of these characters but I don't think you have to in order to enjoy it. I can't wait for episode two, based on episode one I would highly recommend!"
10,"Great first episode. Gonna be a great season, already know I will be wanting more when the season ends. Do not know much about this hero/anti-hero yet but it is definitely building into something much bigger. Introducing some news elements into the Marvel franchise, not to give it away, but ""a higher power"" possibly? We will see."
10,"Oscar Isaac is phenomenal in Moon night. The story starts off slow, but it enthralls you with the details it shares. Once you get a grasp of what is happening to Steven Grant, Isaac's character, you can't look away. The dialogue is hilarious and delivered with Isaac's innate wit, humor and tangible emotion. The storyline is brilliant and keeps you at the edge of your seat. I can't wait for the next episodes. Disney and Marvel have definitely come up with another wonderful show to enjoy."
9,"I've been waiting for a while to see if The Moon Knight could be brought to the big/small screen and I'm impressed. Moon Knight is a tough character to interpret with all of the changes the character has gone through in the comic but the director, actors and crew did an amazing job.

I don't watch many streaming shows as they come out, I prefer to wait for it to all be released and binge it, but I will with this one. It's just that good."
8,Definite Daredevil vibes; the first episode is a slow burn leading up to an interesting final scene. I loved Oscar and felt for his character. I'm hoping for a little more back story but overall really enjoyed the show. Typically first episodes are always a little shaky but there's so much room for character development. Interested to see where they take Ethan Hawke's character; he makes an interesting villain.
9,"Story seems interesting.

Egyptian gods had always the best stories awesome first episode.

Hope the next episodes will be as cool las the first one.

Awesome."
10,"This is a very interesting series. There are deep thoughts in the series, a bit of history, an unsurpassed performance by Oscar Isaac, and the film is not like other Marvel films and it is much better !!!"
10,ONE OF THE BEST 1ST EPISODE OF MARVEL SERIES! Totally lit! Oscar Isaac really did a great job! And I can't wait to see the next episodes! Marvel never cease to disappoint!
8,"Not knowing anything about Moon Knight, I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode. While I'm still grasping what the story is about, the show is compelling and I can't wait to see more. I have a strong feeling this will be another Marvel hit."
9,"The first episode was so mind blowing. For the first time I watch an episode multiple times. I dont't understand why its getting bad reviews so soon. Like come on, its just the first episode. Some people just don't have common sense. Aside from that, this show could become the best there is."
9,"Loved the first episode, the show pacing is great for the character development and I cannot wait for the next episode. Different vibe and feel to it, looking forward to his adventure unfolding because I don't know what's going to happen."
8,"Thought it was a pretty good first episode, got to find out a little about the main character, and what he's been dealing with. I like that they went all in on the costume, a solid chase scene, and an interesting villian. Definitely be watching the rest of the series. People saying it's boring, have 5 min attention spans, and like to smash their toys together for a good time.

I will say there is one scene during the chase that needed much better CGI! It was very noticeable."
10,"Love the show as it sits now I've watched it several times and can't really pick a part that I wasn't completely happy about. Of course it's the first episode of a 6 parts. But I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what comes next!

Thank the people who were involved with bringing this to life!"
9,"Great show and story greatest epic music ever.

I,m very excited to see the end.

And thanks to the director and the greatest heaham nazih.

I,m stay tuned btw."
9,"Can't wait for what's next and how it'll contribute to the MCU.

The music is amazing by Hisham Nazih and the direction from Mohamed Diab I'm proud of them and the way the character contains ancient Egyptian history is remarkable."
10,I honestly didn't think that it was bad it was only the first episode so it dose take time to continue the story. I believe that this show is going to be great especially with Oscar Isaac as moon knight. ??
2,"Very mid for me, at least the first ep. But you should give it a try for the character, the actor tho.. Moon night is a very deep character and Oscar is not my favorite to play him, I personally don't like him as an actor and as a person for what he stands for, but we have to separate it, I'll keep watching to see where it's going.."
9,"One thing that the MCU has always done very well at portraying is that at the end of the day, after each battle has been fought. These characters are still just humans (or have human like emotion/intelligence).

That has really shown through with Isaac's vulnerable and relatable rendition of Steven.

The show takes you on a bit of a roller coaster throughout episode 1. Consisting of mystery, thriller, drama, and action sequences. All of which not giving away too much information or feeling rushed by any means. They did a fantastic job of introduction to the characters, grabbing the viewers attention, and leaving you with your mouth watering in excitement for the next week's episode."
7,"The first episode is rather intriguing. I, personally, love the mystery surrounding Steven. And I'm extremely excited to see what they do with his DID (hopefully they don't give bad representation)."
8,"The show has so much going for it not being fully connected to main MCU storylines, but the CG automatically shows Disney are worried about the show's performance (similar to Black Widow) overall though I don't think it'll impact my love for the show, I just want it to be better in future seasons if it has any."
10,"Was unsure about this show based off the trailer and the relatively unknown protagonist compared to other marvel shows but I highly enjoyed the first episode, it's got mystery, humour, good action sequences, what's not to love! Isaac portrays a man suffering from dissociative identity disorder amazingly well you have to admire his multi- character performance."
10,"I didn't know anything about moonknight going into this. I truly enjoyed the first episode (only one aired so far).

To the point where I was heartbroken when the credits began to roll, bring me more! ??"
9,"Highest praise I can give is that my wife thought it was the best Start of a Marvel series so far! Can't say better than that. But I will, Oscar ideas is a great actor and he brought a lot to his character, great humour and emotion. Didn't know the character before now but really looking forward to the rest of the series."
10,The first episode was really good! I liked how kinda chaotic it was. Oscar Isaac's performance was amazing and it had just the right amount of comedy and action you would expect from a marvel show. Moon Knight's costume design is awesome as well.
10,"The acting was great and the story was interesting and crazy. I didn't know much about the Moon Knight and that didn't matter. I can't wait to see more. I also loved the one throw away line in the episode that has so many people leaving 1 star remarks... If only he could have stopped it, lol!"
9,"Ok,so we all know that factually the armenian genocide happened because it was during a time when photographs,newspapers,telephones and radio existed amd was reporting on it so its now like this is some event that happened hundreds and hundreds of years ago that we are just taking some ancient story out of context right?....these people saying it didn't happen forget that people that lived thru it were still alive until very recently so we all know it happened.....just watch the show and enjoy it for what it is and what it is is awesome and not some hit piece on the people of turkey.."
10,Anyone that can watch this first episode and not love it shouldn't be allowed to comment. This was by far the best opening episode of any Marvel television show. The only thing is that I know I'll want more after the final episode saying that six episodes was way too short.
10,"This is a really fun series. Just relax, grab some favourite snack and just follow the plot. I really loved episode 1 and I cannot wait to see how the following episodes are going to go. The main character killed that role. It has some humour too. I love it love it love it love it.??????"
9,"This show is excellent. I mean, it's only been one episode. But Isaac's acting is excellent. I think this is a must see for anyone with interest in the darker future of the MCU.

I could see this as sharing many aspects with Batman, in terms of the style of action. Plus the psychological aspects are very very interesting. It brings a whole new meaning to the idea of secret identities.

Awesome show!"
10,Absolutely amazing start to the series- From the amazing actors and actresses. The cinematographer was just perfect!. Can't wait to see the remaining episodes.
1,"Anti consumer tactics like weekly releases are just stupid in 2022, we don't watch cable for that reason next thing you know they're going to be putting commercials every 10 minutes into the show.

If this show gets better I'll give it a fair review but as of now there is no merit for me to continue on giving anything positive to the show, it was too slow the character development was really annoying any substance of action moments were removed as a section of blackout with an attempt to censor the violence.

So far gives me venom rip off vibes.

The actors performance is awesome though it may be slow."
10,"I'll admit the beginning was a bit slow for me, but as the show went on i found it very good, as a guy who bought Moon Knight comics back in the day i think this series shows promise . The guys giving 1 star bad reviews are likely the ones from the government denying the genocide and they ain't worth worrying about. Watch it you'll probably like it."
10,"Real good cast, action sequences were really well done! Oscar Isaac transits between his personas really easily, just brilliant. I'm looking forward to when they show more of Konshu and Mark Spectre."
10,Really enjoyed the first episode. Can't wait for more. The actors are great and the story line is interesting. Marvel doesn't disappoint!!! Oscar Isaac is amazing.
10,"Cinematic and mind-blowing. Plays on all the emotions. Its soon becoming our favorite Marvel/Disney+ series, and thats saying a lot because we are big Marvel fans. My family is counting down the days to the next episode!"
10,"The music, acting, cinematography, and effects (outside of some CGI in the car chase) are all fantastic. It really spoke to me and my own struggles and life experiences, and was a very interesting take on Steven Grant.

It may be a bit bewildering for folks that have no prior knowledge of Moon Knight, but as a certified Lunatic I found the first episode exciting, heartbreaking, and very compelling. I can't wait to see where the rest of the show goes!"
10,Simply fantastic. The way the story builds using the madness makes for some of the best Marvel video to date. By far the best first episode of all the Marvel shows. Brilliant ending.
8,"I wish all episodes were available so I could binge watch it. Looks promising, I am not a comic book nerd that knows the origin, so I got questions. Making me wait is the only drawback so far. Hope I don't get busy and forget to dive in and finish."
10,"With only one episode out and I'm already hooked. Looking forward to upcoming episodes! The acting is good, the show keeps you intrigued and I love the costume!"
10,Was worried the show wasn't going to be worth it. It had a slow start but midway through began to pick up. It peaked at the end just in time for it to end with a cliffhanger.
10,Really enjoyed the first episode. Very funny yet also quite dark. Looking forward to see more of this. Surprisingly enjoyable. Oscar Isaac is brilliant and quirky with a very amusing English accent ??. Ethan Hawkes also very good. I highly recommend it to anyone enjoys MCU and non MCU fans alike. ????
10,"First time since these MCU shows started coming out that I'm actually really excited to see the next episode. The first episode was phenomenal in how it introduces Steven Grant as a mild mannered man with obvious psychological issues. People who complain about the blackout moments in the episode obviously do not have the foresight to know that those moments will be revisited later. Oscar Isaac kills it as usual, and his accents are great as well."
10,I don't know anything about this character. The show was entertaining gripping visually stunning with added humour. I think these days people forget to just enjoy things not criticise everything it is someone's vision actualized and enjoyed it thoroughly.
10,"I don't want to spoil anything because I want others to go out and enjoy it . It's a great first episode, Steven's blackouts are a clever way of utilizing the comics and I can't wait to see what else they do."
8,"The first episode was good. Looking forward to the rest of the series. Wonder what crossover story line we'll get with this one. Haven't seen Ethan Hawke in a while, plays character well."
10,Great start to marvel show. Also shows mental illness under a good light. Love the Egyptian gods references. Also the review bombs are silly and just denial of reality.
8,"I'll change this if things change, but the first episode has given me really high hopes for the show. If it keeps going the way it is, it may end up being my favorite Marvel show so far. Ethan Hawke's character is super intriguing, and I've loved all aspects of Oscar Isaac's performance."
10,Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke shine big time! The first episode sets us up for a very promising series. Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke absolutely crush their roles. Playing to their strengths using a story that is rooted in Egyptian lore. I'm sure this will be my favorite Marvel show if they keep this going. Must watch!
8,"I really enjoyed it! It really captured the disorganized feelings that come from a dissociative disorder!

So far this is the most relatable marvel character I've ever seen."
9,Best intro of the Marvel shows so far Imo. I enjoyed that we were discovering things along with Steven for the first episode and hopefully now we will get some alter action with Marc/MoonKnight.
10,"This show is very fun, and different to normal Marvel programs. I think it should be given a chance.

Please don't destroy it's potential by making bad reviews after just one episode."
9,"I love Egypt, Egyptian mythology, egyptian culture, ancient and modern. Damn, I even love egyptian people. And something tells me the story of this character is going to be my jam.

The first episode was gripping, nail biting, full of action, with an increasing rythm that will bring you to the edge of your seat. Oscar Isaac does a brilliant role, playing an imperfect but compassionate man with a secret he doesn't very well understand. And we will see him doing amazing things. I am sure."
9,"The show started very strongly, and for someone who hasn't read the comics it was all the more interesting trying to figure out what was going on. Shot well, was funny in places but also managed a few moments where you really felt for the Steven character, and was delightful for anyone with an interest in Egyptian mythology to see what they made of it.

Can't wait for more."
10,Marvel is always so creative and leaves me wanting more! Moon Knight does just that. The characters are always so complex and interesting. Awesome super hero costume too!!
6,"One of the best shows from Marvel, at least opening episode wise. It had the Marvel flavour, but was also quite different. As someone who knows nothing about this character, I am already hooked, and look forward to watching all the remaining episodes."
10,"What a fun portrayal of a superhero with a split personality. Marvel has proven yet again that they can make a dramatic, fun & action-packed TV show. Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Steven Grant/Marc Spector is absolutely fantastic, as he usually is in his roles. While generally I feel unfavorably toward Ethan Hawke's acting, I feel he also does a wonderful job creating an enigmatic and zealous character."
6,"I'm in no way deep into the marvel TV series rabbit hole (outside of daredevil because it was excellent and the one marvel zombies episode because I saw the comic). This is because they seem generic, but I have always been a fan of moon knight as a hero and his comics, and so far in episode 1 we have definitely seen the weirdness that the character can bring in full effect. I do believe that this will be something different compared to other marvel shows, as even in the first scene we see something truly unique that would never be attempted in another marvel property. Also the fact that the majority of 1 star reviews here start with ""MCU fanboy"" or something to that degree isn't a good look, like come on guys, I'm against marvel fanboy cringe as much as the next guy but you are getting to the point your just as bad."
10,"I can't wait for the rest of this season. Great acting by Oscar and sure to be a creative choice in the ways of Marvel heroes with a mailable story. You can do a lot with Moon Knight, who knows maybe he will land in the avengers. The CGI was great as well."
8,"I have seen First episode of MoonKnight, and I can say Oscar Isaac has done a perfect work with this role. The episode Is full of suspance and it presents the charachters in such a marvelous way. There Is only a Little problem: sometimes green screens are awful."
10,This Marvel geek loved it from minute one and Oscar Isaacs is fantastic in this. Can't wait Dor the other episodes to drop. Well done! Keep me coming.
8,"Definitely intrigued by the show so far. I disagree with certain political views or misinterpretations of history, but it doesn't stop me from enjoying the show. Can't wait to see Oscars character progresses and looking forward to more episodes."
10,"I have watched it 5 times and it is amazing, Ii have been are of the character and I so appreciated the different view from on of his personalities. There is a huge contrast between Steven and Marc. Thankyou for this series, hope it goes beyond Season 1."
10,Moon knight is one comic I could not get into! But seeing this first ep I was gobsmack at how good it was. The story has started of strong Just hope the rest of the show holds up.
10,"Since only one episode has come out so far I can't say much but so far it has been fantastic. Great visuals, interesting story and Oscar Issac has knocked it out of the park."
9,"I'm not familiar with Moon Knight, but this first episode highlights Oscar Isaac's acting and Marvel's excellent world building. I can't wait to see where this series takes us!"
10,"It was a good mix of action, mystery and emotion. I couldn't help but feel very sympathetic for the main character while he struggles with his mental illness. There are some funny scenes and some important historical references that mean a lot. I highly reccend this show!"
8,I like this first episode a lot. It kinda feels scary and confuses the fu out of you but I think it makes it even better. My favourite thing about it was how he skipped forward multiple days over night. Cant wait for the next episode.
