1.0	ll admit raised an eyebrow when saw that pattinson was cast but eat my words he was awesome and hopefully will play the part few more times this film blew me away exciting fast paced surprisingly gritty and genuinely had an awesome story the franchise somehow felt renewed here even if you re not fan of superhero movies you will love this andy serkis was genuinely awesome but when isn he the acting throughout was fantastic with plenty of well known faces great music great special effects ve already booked to see it again 10 10
