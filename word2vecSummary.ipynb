      "1.0\tll admit raised an eyebrow when saw that pattinson was cast but eat my words he was awesome and hopefully will play the part few more times this film blew me away exciting fast paced surprisingly gritty and genuinely had an awesome story the franchise somehow felt renewed here even if you re not fan of superhero movies you will love this andy serkis was genuinely awesome but when isn he the acting throughout was fantastic with plenty of well known faces great music great special effects ve already booked to see it again 10 100.0\tit hurts to write this as this has been my most anticipated movie in ages ve defended robert pattinson as batman from day one and believed matt reeves would make an amazing movie but ve got to be honest and admit disappointed pattinson is great as batman and there are mostly good performances all around especially from the unrecognisable colin farrell but after promising start the plot is just all over the place the movies just way too long and the usually great paul dano over does it as the ridddler can see they really tried to make great batman movie here but it felt like seen most of it before its trying to live up to the popularity of the dark knight but it just not as good1.0\tdisclaimer this is spoiler free review worries about yet another batman coming into the fray should be alleviated very quickly as director matt reeves version of the caped crusader done by the way of seven takes hold early on and refuses too let go on its way to well earned three hour runtime that is full of surprises atmosphere historical nods and artistry as reeve david fincher like epic takes us on memorable gotham adventure that may divide casual fans all the while becoming new favourite for long term fans of dc comics most famous creation those expecting film similar to christopher nolan duly praised dark knight trilogy may find themselves disappointed where reeves is clearly taking robert pattinson portrayal of the vigilante seeking bruce wayne here caught up in mysterious game run by the devious riddler who is targeting high end gotham figures in series of grizzly murders as while reeve film does share some similar dna to nolan version of batman serious in tone and dark in more ways than one this is far less action oriented ride that relishes in the small moments as much as it does when its scattered collection of action does make its way to the forefront taking its inspiration from various crime thrillers found throughout feature film history and undoubtedly featuring narrative taken from batman famed detective oriented tales such as the long halloween the killing joke and year one the batman thankfully skips past bothering with yet another origin story as we find pattinson bruised and battered crusader of justice two years into his crime fighting life as his become creature of the night struggling to balance being the billionaire heir his known for and the hero no one understands and by moving past these steps reeves is allowed to fully focus on the story at hand that allows his creativity as director and his loaded casts talents to shine not household name but director whose failed to put foot wrong since his 2008 breakthrough with cloverfield and then his continued success with horror remake let me in and his double hit of blockbuster goodness with dawn of and war for the planet of the apes films reeves with valuable help from dune cinematographer greig fraser and one of composer michael giacchino best scores in years embeds every frame of the batman with something to take in or be wowed by and the film is easily up there with one of the most impressively put together comic book films and blockbusters in general of the modern era even if its more slow paced nature and untypical narrative may not be what certain viewers are after from this long standing property also helping out the films cause in big way is the work of all main players found within reeve rain soaked affair with the likes of jeffrey wright as everyone favourite policeman lieutenant james gordon john turturro as crime matriarch carmine falcone the unrecognizable colin farrell as the very un danny devito oz the penguin and zoe kravitz as selina kyle catwoman all putting in good work that is overshadowed by the one two double punch of pattinson tormented wayne and paul dano skin crawling take on the riddler with the two polar opposites giving us something as memorable and close to greatness as we ever likely get to christian bale and heath ledger double act in the dark knight divisive choice early on pattinson proves worthy owner of the famous character with his noteworthy work over the last few years proving to be no fluke and edward cullen mere sparkling dream of yesterday and his both imposing and vulnerable here hard mix to get right but one he nails in all instances and while not hogging huge screen time in the overall scheme of things dano work as the films main foe here is menacing unnerving and glorious to behold with eli sunday being transported to the modern era sans his bible and replaced with wide rimmed specs hidden under hideous mask while its hard task to be considered as dastardly great as ledger was in his oscar winning role as batman arch rival dano does job that can be considered right up there in the same league as he gives the batman an unwieldy edge not often found in such fare there no question this serious and moody take on batman world will be compared often to the dark knight with many arguments sure to ensue if you were to ask me here and now what think would say its unlikely anything will ever reach the heights of nolan beloved game changer but this batman comes mightily close which is some form of mighty feed indeed final say very different type of hollywood blockbuster that also sees batman taken in new and exciting direction when it comes to feature films the batman is an artistic and considered epic that sets in motion tale that can be continued soon enough shades of eyeliner out of for more reviews visit jordan and eddie the movie guys1.0\tdetective batman at its peak great storyline just as dark universe as we ve come to expect from dc the gloomy gritty dark tone of this film is exactly what wanted when you think the movie is over there more beautiful cinematography great score0.0\trobert is terrible batman absolutely no bat charisma at all the riddler character is complete bore hated all of this film certainly do not understand the good reviews it not close to the dark knight caliber please do not make sequel0.0\tthis movie is so overlong that you feel like it never going to end at some point thought it was about to end for few times and then another scene plays out that just proves how badly composed and poorly plotted it is the main problem with it is that it tries to please everyone and ends up being all over the place the dark theme and psychological elements are probably influenced by joker and its success but they have no substance whatsoever it just very artsy and pretentious take on the batman character that looks very stylish and flashy but it nothing we haven seen before in fact it uses familiarity as its one and only promise0.0\tll say it started pretty good and liked the cinematography but thought it dragged on and the social commentary on destroying white privileged men was ironic as that what batman is privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as vigilante because he rich and has all the free time to do so and we feel for him because boo boo he an orphan this was very obvious woke fest like the diversity but it when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey pattinson was so sleepy like joe biden in batman suit sleepy joker is my favorite movie of all time and feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps did like farrell as the penguin and the riddler was basically dexter the anti hero0.0\tto preface this review will say when watching this in the cinemas many people walked out was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers the actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain the riddler and the batman penguin was by far the coolest and best actor honestly good fellas type character all other supporting actors were also quite good however think robert pattinson horrible pick for batman the whole time he seems like really awkward and sad goth kid was half expecting him to say gosh get outta my room absolutely trash acting the riddler was even worse he was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable his video calls reminded me of the horror films my 15 year old class mates had made in high school their budgets were the relationship between the batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie the romance was quite sweet and had lot of tension they rode around in their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cute the bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for batman film the old classic camaro was little spine chilling not gonna lie now to answer everyone questions do think robert pattinson was terrible choice for batman for few reasons at first had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was bad and cringey actor for the role he just isn badass over masculine kinda guy like at all he seems awkward and it shows his voice wasn that great his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad the guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors the story was god awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die bombs go off and some personal people batman knows get injured then batman goes welp can be in places at once only human and proceeds to get ko twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights he is by far the worst and weakest looking batman with the worst actor to have played him the cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible did mention this film is hours long to have crap middle and end well know know wow couldn wait for thr hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished definitely wouldn reccomend this garbage piece of cinema 10 for me1.0\tthe riddler paul dano spot on how did it take this long for him to get role like this targets public officials revealing their corruption and killing them in gruesome fashion how did this get away with pg 13 again oh right as long as you don show the details then you can get away with almost anything by now even barely toned down jigsaw in order to stop him it will be necessary for the bat and the cat with amazing chemistry together to stop the rat thanks matt really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with bruce wayne alter ego how about nightwing know it not likely but part of me still holds out hope that grayson will be turned into feature if you ve never checked out the trailer on youtube you re missing out but somehow this managed to convince me fingers crossed for at least one sequel robert pattinson is incredible here seriously can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast the closest we ve come to someone who shouldn be doing it is george clooney and it not like anybody came out of that flick looking good he took that job after doing from dusk till dawn there was good reason to think that he was going to be badass honestly everyone here gives strong performance something that will definitely appeal to some more than others is the genre and tone this is essentially se7en meets zodiac it is not paced like typical massive blockbuster while the action is great especially the martial arts not to mention that car chase there less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the nolan trilogy which also has far more escalation essentially this just isn focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon and think we can all agree that we ve had some great entries that deliver that this is more interested in conveying to the audience that there reason he called the world greatest detective we ve barely seen it outside of the animated ones before so very happy with that choice by them in addition to what ve already mentioned this features some drugs suggestive material and strong language recommend this to any fan of batman 100.0\tam sorry to say but this movie is boring the plot development is slow there are so many dialogs and very little action covered in darkness from super hero movie you expect super action and not another police story if you want love story between batman and catwoman you better see the animation movies cause this one is very poor as there is not any connection between pattinson and kravits pattinson plays single dimension character in this movie without saying much but his voice is normal at least0.0\twanted to love this movie would have settled for hating it instead was bored for three hours the movie is sloppy buffet of darkness rain gloom unnecessary narration wooden acting absurd dialogue pointless characters canyon wide plot holes unresolved story arcs flaccid motivation for the bad guys hyper fast cuts eye rolling detective work conventionally choreographed fight scenes cinematic emo aesthetic pseudo gothic mis en scene complete lack of humor or light hearted moments of any kind no soul in the acting unsophisticated writing timid directing and fully checked list of boxes from the superhero vigilante cliche playbook this is partial list of my complaints if pressed could probably find handful of good things to say but they be far too inconsequential to bail this movie out of the depths of meh having grown up on adam west batman ve lived through the campiness the avant garde the silly the surreal and the downright brilliant looking at you dark knight there have been batman movies ve loved and ones ve hated there are some batman movies my family and quote and admire and others we make fun of while we re watch them to revel in their captivating absurdity this is the first batman iteration where was disappointed bordering on offended at the completely pedestrian effort and the unimaginative forgettable final product if you re under thirteen years old sucker for three hours of tedious brooding and if you don have bone deep familiarity with and love of the genre you might enjoy this otherwise if you re superhero fan and true movie lover please please please steer clear of this one0.0\tstar rating brilliant very good okay poor awful gotham city is rocked by series of murders of key political figures by sadistic killer calling himself the riddler paul dano who holds the city to ransom revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped the batman robert pattinson the alter ego of millionaire bruce wayne starts an investigation of his own crossing paths with woman called selina kyle zoe kravitz who operates as catwoman and wants to find out what happened to her friend it sets them both on collision course with the darkest elements of gotham underworld including notorious gangster the penguin an unrecognisable colin farrell and crime boss carmine falcone john turturro who may be sitting on devastating secret that could shatter both their lives the batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation here writer director matt reeves delivers mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever less doesn seem to be more anymore at least not to the cinema artistes but from this end all can see is film drowning in its own indulgence reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak heavy tone established by christopher nolan and so we have gotham city with seemingly endless heavy rain and gloomy skies set against pattinson dark brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack it just one of many things ripe for parody in film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light even more overdone is dano dark riddler operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous thrown in to this is the topical social justice speeches that litter film and tv today with kravitz catwoman even praising the sinister villain who we re meant to hate at one point for killing all these white privileged holes it just trying to cram whole load of eggs in to one basket over ambitious and overlong and by the time of the main villain grand master plan at the end you re too overwhelmed or bored to care everyone else can think what they like but personally this is one of the most pretentious batman ever which might have been bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent or at least had an old fashioned lawrence of arabia style intermission at some point0.0\twent in with ultra low expectations because think robert pattison is god awful actor and this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that you can always go lower actually angry wasted hours of my life and trust me every minute of that time was felt however let have some positives cinematography is great and the music is fantastic the opening scenes with the batman made me think was going to have another heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special but then the film gets going part saw rip off and so desperately wants to be se7en in its execution the story dragged you don care about any of the characters and found myself pining for clooney and his bat nipples and mr freeze what found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with nolan and warned him we re going to make better batman than you no just no like the last lord of the rings film this has an ending that just keeps on coming something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave the film continues something else is wrapped up and you think that it and it keeps going something else and on and on and on can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up massive line of coke and snorted it midway through and no not joking welcome to southampton with regards to the plank of wood sorry pattison in the initial scenes was genuinely excited never fan of his costume before seeing it here suddenly got it he proper beats down on someone in vicious attack they get back up in fact everyone he bat punches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again there no real threat here when bale smacked someone down they stayed dead but then when bale stripped off same as affleck they were built robert looked like me and look like mr burns from the simpsons skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever in fact when robert bent over in one topless scene his bones stuck out and thought wings were going to pop out but then why wouldn they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role would have sacked him there and then his time as bruce is strictly limited thank god so you can really judge him for that as bruce he just stands there and looks confused as the batman by the end he became parody his batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke batman in the college humour videos is for alfred genius when he was mad it just look like he was pulling cum face and don even get me started on the adrian mole diary keeping that going in with the voice over narration honestly with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so have never hated film so much as did this and given went in with low expectations even am surprised at how fuming am at myself for wasting my time on it0.0\teverything about this move is glaring testament to how far hollywood has fallen all saw was weak little boy and supporting cast to fit it he just doesn fit the roll ve met 90 year old military vets that have more metal than this supposed super hero hell prefer to watch ryan reynolds version of the green lantern any day over this0.0\tcouldn even finish this drivel firstly pattinson is good actor but doesn fit batman role film is way too long and boring action is underwhelming overall big disappointment can recommend it at all0.0\thour slog of hour of material can recommend it sadly barely plot no character development and just sooooo slow lack of personalities with all the cast1.0\thesitate to say that movie is perfect especially after first viewing but gosh dang if this isn close and boy does it earn its beefy three hour runtime batman was always meant to be film noir and it incredible to me that we haven seen this before now this is mystery crime drama film that happens to feature batman and it beautiful it dripping with gritty atmosphere gotham is bleak decaying world in this film and it has never been shown to this extent nor with this level of visual prowess any shot in this movie would be considered the best shot in any other superhero movie if this isn at least in contention for every cinematography award then awards will officially have lost all meaning to me the story is puzzle like all good crime mysteries and the puzzle pieces place themselves together at very satisfying rate it so efficiently paced making three hours feel like far far less boasting one of the most intelligent scripts ever seen in superhero movie the batman has minimal exposition and yet is still stuffed to the brim with subtle thematic depth and small but satisfying character arcs batman changes in his worldview throughout this movie and ve never seen it done this effectively in batman film things become personal to him in such believable way felt it even amidst the chaotic plot that untangling itself around the character many will compare this film to the dark knight but that not fair this is an entirely different beast going on an completely different journey this is cinema and it cinema at one of its finest moments matt reeves has cemented himself as one of the world greatest working filmmakers and love that he putting his talents to work in popular genres elevating them to greater heights0.0\tthese 10 10 reviews are paid for do not be fooled this movie is simply mediocre very little about it was great lets not even get to the bloopers lol it felt like hour movie that drags and drags and nothing much happens dark sure but great dont make me laugh we have accepted mediocrity as brilliance it seems sad sad times we live in0.0\tadvise you to take antidepressants before you start watching this movie it is so baaaaad dark and booooring and the vampire dude is the worst batman ever0.0\tmy and my son watched this film and it was rubbish even the bat mobile was crap nothing futuristic about it the one from the batman movie was light years ahead acting was good story was boring and slow think the 10 ratings was because people was comparing it to other dc movies not on the actual film0.0\tnever thought that would view worse dc movie than catwoman or the harley quinn movie was sorely mistaken the batman by far is the absolute biggest mistake in any comic book adaptation the casting was wrong there was not one cast member who had good performance the script was pitiful it was too long and all over the place the direction was terrible and the editing was questionable nothing was positive about this film except the end credits where you could escape the misery0.0\twas expecting to be hooked to the movie from the gecko but the exact opposite happened it was slow pased boring and didn grab my attention for more than minutes at time didn feel like batman but kid dressing up like batman more intrigued by catwoman than batman during this flick might give it another try later on1.0\twhat the one thought you had when warner bros casted robert pattinson as the batman mine was nooooooo was bewildered on the decision questioning if this the best they ve got for batman didn hate him but was concerned if he could take up big role like this as he doesn have the regular features embodied by the titular character and today the day witness myself that was wrong pattinson is great batman hell he slayed as batman yes his features don really resemble the classic batman but he made it his own this is one batman that is better than ben affleck and george clooney and audience would compare him to the likes of christian bale and michael keaton also there something about pattinson jawline that complements his looks everytime he wearing the mask he oozes his seemingly mysterious vibe that appears alluring enough for audience 2022 the batman runs for about hours long and what special about this one is it offers journey that doesn dive into its origin story making it different piece compared to others it not centred on my parents were killed in the back of an alley when was kid but it takes on different story focusing more on gotham city and its grim corruption happening within it engaging throughout though it not meant for some viewers because the narrative isn made for audience preferring commercial films would say the context and story are as rich as the dark knight and joker if you have big issue with these two mean this as no offense but stick to marvel like one of those ps4 batman games the film offers bleak and dreary look at gotham transporting the audience into world of transparency and reality it doesn shy away from showing us the rawness of the city the coal coloured alleys and underground tunnels the debris scattered on the floor and the hard hitting fact that no one is safe therefore audience has an easy time relating themselves with our world filled with arising problems and issues if you re wondering zoe kravitz did good job as catwoman would say yes however she my least favourite compared to others who have held the same role like michelle pfeiffer anne hathaway she could ve been better kudos to the makeup department for putting on such brilliant work for mr penguin if hadn known that was colin farrell would not have recognized him even bit farrell did an excellent job as penguin but there were few times that he reminded me of jared leto in house of gucci with the overused accent and his character was mostly missing in the second half which was let down for me what brave decision when they did 180 turn on the riddler they realized that gotham is dark place they changed riddler into someone darker than what the comic has offered the riddler is profoundly menacing and he will remind you of heath joker in tdk once in while paul dano did great job but felt they could have picked another actor prolly that just me but hey dano is one of the issues have is the overused soundtrack for all hours long rarely you will encounter scene with no music background it takes away bit of the grounded experience and the suspense that comes from it if only they restrained the music much more believe this film would be scarier what worse is the music that was playing sounded quite the same with the next it comes to point where felt irritated by it also wasn impressed by the climax scene it feels like they are not giving their best shot it just not ummphhh enough as what has been hinted in the first two hours just when you thought it the beginning of an exciting final battle scene is apparently almost the end of the movie the reason behind this might probably be because of the not so formidable villain let take recent example the riddler is somewhat similar to rami malek safin in no time to die in terms of his capabilities and abilities they both ace in strategy and planning but weak in combating resulting in an almost non existent final battle verdict as if like bleak painting canvas sold at prestigious auction the batman exhibits an ambitious look into gotham gritty landscape all along strongly coloured with frighteningly dour tone illuminating what could possibly be the best movie of the year so far1.0\thours hero movie it might be quite an adventure for those who expect action packed movies like avengers or the dark knight the batman is not an action movie it noir detective film just enjoy the dark moisty mood this movie has if you enjoyed movies like zodiac se7en sure you ll love it go to the theatre immediately1.0\tmatt reeves the batman is hell of movie it is the darkest live action batman movie ever made and the longest one too the batman fills with top notch action sequence that not only exciting but it cinematic too the cinematography was just incredible michael giacchino the batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever it enduringly great the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when batman shows up it really making me hyped more because of that colin farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as the penguin paul dano performance is giving me heath ledger joker vibes but not trying to be heath ledger joker which is still great paul dano the riddler is still terrifying and very disturbing villain zoe kravits performances as catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as michelle pfeiffer in batman returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as michelle pfeiffer and the catwoman fighting sequence is definitely win for zoe and did still like her lot in here and in the end we got the batman himself robert pattinson all can say about him as the batman is that hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play the batman which is really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome batman now he was become my second favorite batman next to christian bale in number one still the story of the batman itself is great and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow it not boring but feel like they can make it little bit faster if it only one or two or three scene probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that but at in the end the batman is still hell of great movie it still amazing and it still incredible was impress by most of the thing that happens was excited was hyped was stunt by all the amazing thing that they ve done the batman is fire0.0\tok dc you are knocking off the crow now so what haha how stupid is it that the media shows the riddler stuff live this movie is so dumb how far super hero movies are falling down drain cesspool of crap movies lower your iq adults to watch hollywood try so hard to make some old fun colorful super hero dark and melancholy gray and black people on anti depressant1.0\tspeechless the new generation of batman begins the batman is beyond extraordinary piece of cinema and not only from comic book view but from cinema point of view it cinematography score pacing dialogue mood and setting is masterfully crafted bravo matt bravo patt bravo zoe bout to go rewatch it1.0\tthe batman 2022 is movie my wife and caught an advanced screening of last night the storyline follows gotham shortly after the batman has emerged and established himself in the streets serial killer known as the riddler starts killing spree of everyone influential within gotham hierarchy until bruce wayne in inevitably the target how are all of these people tied together and can batman tie the pieces together before wayne is the next victim this movie is directed by matt reeves cloverfield and stars robert pattinson twilight zoë kravitz kimi colin farrell total recall paul dano there will be blood john turturro do the right thing peter sarsgaard garden state andy serkis lord of the rings jeffrey wright shaft and barry keoghan eternals the storyline look and feel of this movie is an the characters are perfectly cast and well executed farrell dano and kravitz were 10 10 this movie does fantastic job of depicting the batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent this also did good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end this has very good jeph loeb comics feel to it and does good job delivering the detective elements of batman the violence was also brilliant and very well done will say this did not need to be hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited this film likely should have been hair under and half hours overall this is magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for batman fans would score this 10 and strongly recommend it1.0\tjust got out of the batman this movie really won be for everyone easily the darkest batman movie yet it is gritty depressing and not fun movie at all this isn your usual comic book movie it detective movie with more in common with se7en than previous batman movies the first two thirds of the movie are amazing at one point turned to my son and said this is masterpiece everything works and is brilliant was 100 enthralled but boy does it drop the ball in the final act of the cast pattinson is great collin farrell is ok zoe kravitz was fine too but she has zero chemistry with pattinson keaton and pfeiffer they are not paul dano though was incredible especially in the scene in arkham whilst geoffrey wright is as great as he always is on the downside it does have some pacing issues and is really too long though not sure what cut and really wasn keen on the ending don know if it is comic book storyline they did as think the final act really lets the movie down it here in the final act that you feel the movies run time was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening1.0\thours run time is totally worth it well mature dark movie which batman character deserves robert pattinson as batman and bruce wayne is the best casting choice after christian bale it so dark gritty visceral and god damn great movie colin farrell was fantastic couldn recognise him zoe kravitz as selina kyle and cat woman was great she was fantastic paul dano jeffrey wright andy serkis were great too casting was done so great bat vehicle was so ing great when the engine revs you will get the goosebumps action scenes were absolutely ing great its loud bombastic and visceral which will give goosebumps fight sequence were absolutely gritty cinematography done by greig fraser is another masterpiece from him michael giacchino music composition really great it has that dark gritty grandeur theme music the dirty criminality and madness in gotham city you will feel it it so dark which batman character needs production design is just brilliant story wise this movie felt more to detective batman comic book and done outstandingly couldn not find any error in the whole movie this is well made brilliant movie by matt reeves totally worth waiting for can wait to see it again direction 10 10 cinematography 10 10 acting 10 10 screenplay 10 10 story 10 10 music 10 10 this movie deserves 10 101.0\tthe batman 2022 robert pattinson zoe kravitz jeffrey wright colin farrell paul dano john turturro andy serkis peter sarsgaard filmmaker matt reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the bob kane comic book hero with pattinson standing tall and brooding as bruce wayne employing vigilante style justice as the caped cursader while gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal riddler dano affectively disturbing and gaining an unlikely ally in selina kyle ass kicking kravitz in pre catwoman mode arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by greig fraser and james chinlund production design all aided by the foreboding score by michael giacchino full of bombast and dread farrell under ton of unrecognizable prosthetics has field day in getting in touch with his inner robert de niro as the penguin by all means see it in imax1.0\tfor better or worse mostly better the batman is when he detective first superhero second bleak yet thrilling noir but also with glimpse of exhilarating hope it doesn hurt really if we re having new batman film especially if it took riveting route like this pattinson and kravitz were explosive together1.0\tgot to watch this movie early because of special screening was extremely excited my expectations were very high and still they were surpassed robert as batman is just awesome majestic and scary and yet at the end he also evokes that sense of hope batman gives to the population paul dano as the riddler is so creepy both robert and paul gave an oscar worthy acting the rest of the cast gives amazing performances too beautifully shot and the score is thrilling it does feel bit long but it is rewarding0.0\tseeing the positive ratings and been fan of all the batman series of christopher nolan was suspecting this may not match nolans version but this was much beyond the lower levels of any batman movie it was painful hour journey in the movie hall not sure who the fans are with positive ratings making it in imdb many might not agree0.0\tdon know if lot of these over exuberant reviews are bots or fake but as massive life long fan of almost all of the batman films these people must ve saw different film than what witnessed this friday on opening night this movie almost had the don look up recipe going for itself meaning that after saw an engaging trailer an amazing cast and director and what appeared to be an exciting plot you just think there no way this movie could drop the ball well let me be the first to tell you that much like don look up this film simply did not deliver the goods and really really wanted to love this iteration of our beloved dark knight it just simply already been done thanks to tim burton and christopher nolan you have to have some back story and little more character origins in your script to make these super hero movies really shine joker batman begins and the original batman movie all executed this to perfection ll watch again to see if it clicks during second viewing0.0\tnot entirely sure what was expecting other than maybe joker 2019 surprise gem although with perpetually stoned face pattinson my expectations sure weren high against my misgivings decided to give it shot and regretted it about 30 minutes into it depressing and not in good way slow paced in the worst way with yet another batch of terrible miscasts continuing the trend of casting the worst choices for titular roles amateur at best action scenes far cry from what you expect from batman film michael keaton would be turning in his grave if he weren still alive today but hey it wore me out so bad it ended up curing my insomnia1.0\twhen the film was announced the question that overshadowed the project was how do you revolutionize something that has already been made iconic by directors like tim burton like zack snyder or even like christopher nolan well the question to that answer today is matt reeves the batman is revolutionary innovative unique and spectacular project revolutionary film from the very first scene marked by comic narrative theater of details and spectacularity palette with noir type graphic novel tone and with characters that seem to be introduced for the first time but the genius lies in honoring to the investigative side of the most famous detective in the world which resolves in complete success matt reeves manages to give to the fans to the legacy of batman and to comics in general unique masterpiece of its kind unprecedented and that looks only and only forward film that is exhibited with perfect photograph signed by greig fraser which with its soft and reddish colors enhances every emotion every look every moment every action this one directed by reeves manages to create an atmosphere typical of the best batman comics focusing above all on the depth of each scene look and context above all it should be emphasized that matt reeves has concentrated lot on enhancing the character of batman in every aspect with dedicated and precise shots aimed at capturing any emotion that leaked from the mask as well as enhancing his gestures and all non verbal communication perfect cast that moves on the screen like perfect symphony from the unrecognizable and surprising colin farrell to the fearsome john turturro from the splendid zoë kravitz to the excellent andy serkis and jeffrey wright as the new commissioner gordon which he completely masters without forgetting the perfect as always paul dano in the role of unique and disturbing riddler but the one on whom there were too many doubts but all fallen down immediately from the first scene is surely robert pattinson who gives us young batman immature and resentful full of energy and revenge but who certainly has lot to learn from himself and from the environment people around him practically an unforgettable and more than unique interpretation obligatory mention goes to michael giacchino who composes one of the best soundtracks ever managing to give the film the tone that has been so sought after therefore constituting one of the most important pieces of this extraordinary puzzle the batman by matt reeves is an inimitable masterpiece with unique and unprecedented style practically profound revolution0.0\tneither good superhero movie nor good crime movie as lifelong dc and batman fan just want to say disappointed really wanted to like the movie but it was so flat there were some great camera works and awesome shots but then again it neither came out as good superhero movie nor good crime thriller movie0.0\tthe movie begins painfully slow and continues like that for the first hour and every now and then it keeps its slow pace the brown colors of the movie don allow to appreciate the costumes and the rest of things like the batmobile even the movie title is shown in the most simplistic way that reminds of 70 bad film worst the score is very slow for batman movie and what think is the batman tune sounds like ripoff of john william imperial march darth vader theme but in slower pace throughout the moviei was thinking this tune whenever the batman shows up sounds very familiar until remembered it from the first star wars trilogy am surprised that giacchino wrote great scores for tom holland spider man trilogy and the star trek remake and he failed miserably to this movie the score is what puts you in the right mood acting the acting by farrell the penguin dano the riddler wright lt gordon turturro falcone and sarsgaard colson was good even kravitz catwoman was better that pattinson wayne the batman even barry keoghan the joker was better than pattinson0.0\tbatman is superhero film that comes with somany unnecessary scenes they could finish this film in hours or less then it would be master piece film music have similarly to michael giacchino own work called war for the planet of the apes and some point it irritating matt reeves want change batman image think he done that its the worst batman film ever watched since long time1.0\tthe most realistic batman film ever made ve never seen batman struggle that much the script was really tight and even though it hours long didn see any superfluous details top notch visuals sound and acting the soundtracks of the movie were really good after watching the movie it just stuck in my head0.0\tsorry and can understand any review above maybe the story was boring the characters where boring the alleged dark take was just that filmed dark very disappointing oh and thanks for throwing in bunch of woke virtual signaling that always helps bad movie1.0\tyou ve seen million batman movies but you still need to steel yourself for the darkest dark knight yet starring robert pattinson as dc caped crusader 2022 new movie the batman is an intense apocalyptic cinematic experience following the famous murder of bruce waynes parents wayne is two years into his crusade against gotham city street crime as batman unpicks the cryptic clues the investigation peels away greater conspiracy but the real riddle is how the ranting killer twisted motive ties back to batman himself he batman in theaters march is barely superhero movie christopher nolan criminal politics and zack snyder operatic brutality plus the standalone joker movie psychological backstory vaguely timeless design and layers of dark irony most of all the batman is straight up horror film this new flick is pg 13 but it on whole other level from the relatively bloodless dark knight movies and on different planet from any marvel film immersing you in nerve shredding three hours of escalating dread and simmering pain garnished with some astonishingly nasty and dark touches and makes think what one man can go through because of loosing his parents you absolutely 100 can show the batman to child it will give them nightmares and bad thoughts robert pattinson batman is lank haired mess and is world away from christian bales outstanding professional look this darkest dark knight may not be for everyone and certainly not kids but it gripping and nerve shredding bat thriller the one thing that matt reeves explores that christopher nolan doesn is how dark and how can he make it to the story and comic and even horror movie the batman should have been rated not pg 13 because how intense dark and scary it is the soundtrack was done by michael giacchino its very graceful incorporation of specific themes for batman and selina as well as pre existing music ranging from classical pieces to nirvana provides tonal variation to ensure that the batman never becomes punishing downer go watch the batman on march 2022 at your regal theater1.0\tnot big marvel dc universe fanboy but the darkness and the allure of the original backstory of the batman was one from my youth and continued through the nolan trilogy as good as the nolan films were they were almost too big for the scale of the character dark vengeful introverted where nolans films may have missed reeves delivers and boy does he this is dark and brooding catnip for this long standing established batman fan though the timeline was skewed to allow very important character seemingly ommited it easy to get past with danos spectacularly portrayed riddler dano nails it in the third act as he is unmasked and the creepiness and acting skills come out in full force which almost wish his character was unmasked earlier just to see his incredible acting skill come out from behind the shroud of obscurity as for pattinson had my doubts and not because of his acting skill level but moreso his physical presence that was literally erased the first sequence of him fully suited and mowing through anyone that stood in his way watch this without distraction and dimly lit to help capture what reeves delivers on powerful script with few miniscule eye rolls mostly to hokiness but not enough to slow the machine down stars1.0\tgreetings from lithuania the batman 2022 for me personally was not as entertaining as christopher nolan take in the dark knight trilogy if would compare this movie to nolan series it would be more close to the dark knight that said liked the batman for its being very faithful adaptation of batman universe itself saw two or three dc animated batman movies and this film was more in common with those then any other batman movie ever made the batman 2022 is very dark movie and mean that in every way in whole hours running time there is basically scene or two set in day time and 98 of the film is set during night and looks like in gotham it is always raining it is very gritty and down to earth setting and that liked about it the atmosphere of this movie highly reminded me of se7en 1995 performances were good and robert pattinson was superb as batman yet think it was zoë kravitz who stole the show overall the batman 2022 is dark gritty and very down to earth adaptation of batman for younger audiences who grew up on watching marvel movies no offence really enjoy them as well this adaptation of batman will be test of patience this movie is not for everyone and reminded me of joker 2019 more then any other comic book movie in its running time hours this movie did drag here and there but as whole package it really worth seeing not my favorite batman movie but solid one0.0\tthe production values are striking right from the first moments dark bleak and dystopian and the crisp direct dialogue added to the film noir effect which was definitely good sign and then and then it just goes on and on with the plot becoming ever more convoluted the virtue signalling gets thicker and thicker and the dialogue becomes more and more laughable by the last half hour was mainly staring at the ceiling and tapping my fingers waiting for it to lumber to an end which did not come nearly soon enough suspect people will either love or hate this wagnerian portentous pile of nonsense loathed it0.0\tthe good kravitz did fine job as did all the other actors the cinematography was well done as expected from big budget they did shoot lot of film to try to create an epic cool silhouette of the batmobile the bad goes woke in the middle with catwoman cursing the white privileged holes virtually no back story to make you give damn about anyone actually wanted riddler to win and his plan was obvious was actually boring in many parts the ugly the story line convluted messy mostly useless deus ex machinas all over the place the ending was plain out stupid somehow that will all be wiped clean in the sequel as if it never happened pattinson didn even have to appear bruce wayne almost never did this is what you get when you forget you re filming batman and not twilight no fun whatsoever droll downer of movie for three long hours another film which will have an artificially inflated imdb rating worst opener of all the batman franchises0.0\thave never been so bored watching film every shot seems to be way longer than it should be making it very slow and boring film not to mention robert pattinsons boring monotone mumble throughout the film there were several points where was relieved because thought the film was about to come to an end spoiler alert it didn0.0\thave been following dc and marvels and batman specially in dc and have seen nolan directed ones too this is boring lengthy depressing movie and batman capabilities seems like just like another normal human being the fun of fancy gadgets swanky entries batmobile etc has been brought several notches down disappointed1.0\tjust saw the movie and don even know where to begin it not like any cbms like ever the riddler was great especially the performance of paul the funeral and the riddle scenes were amazing really loved those parts the mystery was done real great and the action sequences were perfect especially the car chase prison escape and final battle the film is dark really loved the tone it doesn rush itself this movie might have the best catwoman yet her character was good even if she didn have big screentime robert is great batman love that we get to see more of his detective side beautiful score and cinematography the music was way too loud at times especially at that club scene1.0\tit was so good the beginning the narration bruce voice his accent gotham city music and sounds it felt like reading the comic and the pages come alive in my head it was great and live violence action crime this movie has everything beautiful car scenes to strong fight scenes to memorable and emotional and dark scenes to those detective scenes can find the right words you have to watch it was told it about hours but didn feel like it could easily go on for another hour or more and one last thing make sure to watch it on big screen because it very dark and detailed movie theatre would be the best place to feel the movie as whole1.0\tas director matt reeves repeatedly emphasized in several interviews before its release the batman is detective noir with dark atmosphere from beginning to end if you look at scenes reminiscent of david fincher se7en the appearance of corrupt gotham city public power politicians and mafias you also can enjoy this film as crime drama godam city gloomy appearance created by director matt reeves is fantastic thanks to the ability of greg fraser the cinematographer of rogue one and dune the overall visual beauty of the batman is next level compared to average superhero movies the script written by matt reeves and peter craig is also commendable as soon as the movie begins it welcomes the audience with an event that lays out the main plot of the film despite the 176 minute running time which is nearly three hours long there is no useless scene it boldly omits batman origin and presents young batman who has only been active for two years it feels as if reeves is responding to criticisms imposed on zack snyder batman such as he did not make good use of batman detective aspect and batman is murderer in this reeves emphasizes batman detective identity as much as possible and shows the philosophy of not using gun through dialogue and action it does not make mistakes that batman superman made such as packing too much storyline in the movie or being too focused on setting up the sequel director matt reeves have teased potential sequel but at the same time he argued that the first film should be able to work stand on its own director reeves work the batman succeeded in creating an impressive work with the story of batman growth relationships with new characters and ridler murder game warner brothers who had to go through lot of critical or commercial failure due to excessive interference in the production of films such as justice league and suicide squad turned to guarantee the freedom of creators as much as possible as result work that reveals matt reeves ambitious vision was born over the past few years dc has disappointed lot of people and it is also true that it has become difficult to see dc go up to the same position as marvel and compete with them however recently films such as joker and the suicide squad masterpieces that utilize dc unique personality and creator vision have appeared and the batman seems to have no problem standing next to it hope that matt reeves will be able to complete trilogy that utilizes his vision safely without following the path of snyderverse now dc has found its own way not just copying marvel and the batman is another step toward that path1.0\twas really enthusiastic about reeve interviews it finally seemed like his version would be more accurate to the comics which think it been failing long enough with batman movies the dark detective noir story is there in fact and there some great atmosphere with the first 15 minutes of the movie totally exciting me about how this was going the settings and cinematography of the movie are really great absolutely loved that aspect of this movie and the design of batman suit doesn look that bad in the dark even though it definitely not my favourite live action version now really wanted to like pattison version of the character like lot of his work but this is an absolute miss thought so from the very first news of his casting but kept hopeful for surprise that didn come as batman he definitely not imponent his un athletic frame and skinny legs wouldn impose fear to little girl it really annoys me that he didn put any effort on the physical side of his character which is so important for this role you can tell he didn do any serious exercise when you see his torso and arms naked sure he got paid enough to have done better than that it almost disrespectful and before you think oh but this is batman starting he gets bigger later wrong he trains for years in asia before he gets back and he fully prepared physically what he gains through being batman in gotham is experience knowledge and new gadgets in terms of performance his bruce wayne is pretty much an emo which is all the opposite to what the character does in the comic books to get as far away from suspicion as possible another miss he never shows his sadness and tortured personality as bruce wayne not the looks not the performance the fights were somehow cool mostly thanks to the cinematography but after the first fight when bats uses one of his weapons he totally forgets about his belt and doesn do anything else than punching and kicking and don find that satisfying enough batman gadgets is one of the things that give him advantage over any other fighter or bunch of fighters it disappointment to see how the director thought about batman technology for his detective work but almost nothing on his fighting in terms of villains there were moments where riddler was creepy enough to give chills but it fell flat in the end penguin didn strike in any particular way even though farrell is great actor the character felt washed down and wasted for me lacking lot of his classic characteristics catwoman looks good but also didn felt much like the comic book could definitely have done more in such long run of film feel these realistic takes of batman are killing the character in movies don know why directors and writers fill their mouths saying they re fans and they want to be faithful to the comics and they make batmans that can do anything of what the character normally does whish someone would chill out bit and make it bit more fantastic within the character characteristics this one in particular is even more realistic than nolan and for me that very bad thing had enough of normal guys walking around in useless armour throwing punches standing like robots can only hope this director is saving the gargets and abilities aspect for future movies to show improvement and evolution on the character but think it could have been done in this movie being over two and half hours there was more than enough time to show it as movie is not bad but neither great the pace is too slow it really drags by times with long redundant conversations repetitive scenes and the characters not too well adapted specially pattison batman another disappointment for me because keep waiting for proper adaptation of the batman from the comic books as there never been one whish affleck would have done his take with deathstroke his cool batsuit more action more fun his version was by far the best no way anyone can say his assault to rescue martha wasn the best batman scene ever filmed so far ll keep waiting1.0\tperfect masterpiece that all that should be told this is not action heavy but very plot story driven filled with fantastic performances so expect visually stunning story driven movie than big action driven batman movie unlike its predecessors truly different and perfect1.0\tout of stars the batman is an electrifying dark superhero film and dives into an psychological crime story director matt reeves takes this film into whole new dark direction so dark that every scene seems faded or taking place in night raining setting the script and narration in the beginning sets the tone of the film with bruce wayne giving narrative about how he brings fear that every criminal stays away from the shadows the film is one awesome superhero film watching it the first time may not be enough with so much to digest on what is going on with the depth layer of the story for hour run time the film packs so much that it never once felt long the script and direction is great dark atmospheric setting showing gotham city that is on ticking time bomb with crime happening nirvana song playing couple of times setting that mood of the film which is dark and setting that depressing mood but it works great the action sequences are great the fight scenes are well choregraphed the villains riddler played by paul dano is great riddler played more like zodiac killer the direction plays like crime solving film with batman being detective and on the trail of the riddler leading batman investigating criminal syndicates like falcone john turturro and penguin colin farrell and catwoman zoe kravitz assisting him with the investigation the film gritty and grounded with its action sequences the car chase was awesome with the cinematography being close to the action as possible robert pattinson is great as dark version of bruce wayne and great as batman paul dano is good john turturro colin farrell zoe kravitz andy serkis and jeffrey wright were all great with there roles the cinematography and music score were great the film does have one brief scene that hints towards another film the film has deep depth story that packs lot and ties lot together it is one awesome film that will leave lot talking about0.0\treeves tries so desperately to be christopher nolan but just doesn measure up it always dark always raining always moody always trying and failing to be something he couldn ever be then when you think it can get any more ridiculous it tries to become se7en and reeves tries to turn dano into kevin spacey and sees himself as some david fincher seriously what complete waste of some great actors pattinson dano skarsgaard farrell etc and the whole while you get to hear about rich white privilege so here we go again us plebes get to be lectured to again by hollywood and their narcissism telling us again how those evul white people and their priviledge see how you are being used my god it like they re unable and completely incapable of realizing that they re exposed as frauds and hypocrites capitalism lets them live in ivory towers protected by their armed security while lecturing us on the proper virtues to live by given jeffrey wright and the constant vitriol he spews it makes perfect sense that he features prominently here take your woke garbage hollywood and shove it1.0\twas able to see the movie yesterday so let me start of saying that the movie is amazing yesterday after getting out of the theater said it was but today after sleeping night over it would even rate it the tone and the visuals really hit different and it different batman movie than all the previous iterations matt reeves and peter craig really are skilled writer set and the plot the dialogues and even the humor are sharply written kudos to both of them the score of the movie is amazing please do not listen to it before the movie you need to hear and see the combination of visuals and the movie it full on amazing michael giacchino has perfectly crafted score for ages in certain scenes could feel my excitement and my adrenaline pump just because of the score it very long movie so it really does take its time in developing the story and the characters found myself liking the first 3s bit more than the final stretch but overall it was amazingly told from start to finish the visuals fight scenes and the camera work is very well crafted too there no shaky cam scenes no fight scene is shot too close and one particular scene had my jaw dropping tried to avoid all the trailers and promo material to not spoiler the movie for me so kind of went in not knowing and from the opening the movie turned out to be way darker than expected it to be but it good thing honestly and am full on with it if it turns out to be trilogy and with that said people will try to compare it to tdk which in my opinion isn fair because tdk was the second part in trilogy this movie here should be compared to batman begins and to answer the question yes think it better than batman begins and if matt reeves can keep up the good writing and really develop the story even more we might have better overall trilogy of batman and one more thing which find very important since the movie is rated pg 13 would still advise parents to have second thought about taking younger children to the movies it very dark movie and very intense personally think it even bit hard for some teenagers who might react sensitive to the themes and scenes of the movie0.0\tthere so much wrong with this movie the first major problem is that it doesn understand batman batman forever understood batman better than this crap robert pattinson plays bruce wayne as if he were an emo who spends his days locked in his dark room listening to nirvana and my chemical romance he doesn even act like human he like an edgelord teenager defended the casting choice leading up to the release of the film but after seeing it need to go back and delete every comment defending the casting of pattinson second problem is catwoman not the performance but the character herself she adds nothing to the film and the romance between her and batman was so forced as there was never any chemistry between the two heroes the scenes with her are absolutely the most uninteresting and think it would have benefitted greatly if she was removed so the movie was shorter and more focused on batman being the detective and going against penguin and riddler the pacing is already super slow but every scene with catwoman feels like they stretched one page of screenplay into five minutes of film riddler is okay like paul dano he doesn get lot to do penguin actually ended up being more interesting and he was given even less to do jim gordon in this movie is terrible easily the worst character all he does in this movie is read clues out loud and go what does this mean and then batman figures everything out it so boring this is probably 10 movie but the fact that it getting such good reviews infuriates me hate knowing that this is the future of batman and ben affleck won be getting his solo movie now after being replaced by an emo loser version of bruce wayne not saying batman superman was great or anything but my god it was better than this by miles at least it was made by people who are clearly fans of the characters everyone in this movie other than colin farrell and paul dano seem like they re miserable to be in the movie this movie is boring and pretentious but has somehow convinced people it masterpiece it not it like the batman version of blade runner 2049 but without the skill behind the camera that denis villeneuve brings to his movies he understands how to make slow movies feel epic and inspiring matt reeves does not0.0\tthink its great idea good twist gives pretty darker millennial generation vibe to it meaning bunch of bratty complaining teens but after watching am just gunna stick to the christopher nolan batman chritian bail way better but robert did much better job then was expecting but enough with the wokness mean catwoman being lezbian enough is enough1.0\tyes it may be the billionth batman film in recent memory but the batman is easily among the best if not the best batman films ever made everything works in this movie and mean everything from the cinematography to the visuals set direction score acting direction writing it never fails and it never lets up there are few tiny predictable things here and there but none really take an impact on the quality of the movie nor the story its telling it is hours long but the runtime passes fast and honestly never wanted it to end robert pattinson is just fantastic in this film batman for the ages and honestly my favorite film adaptation of the character yet the rest of the supporting cast is also excellent jeffrey wright bringing new layer onto the character of commissioner gordon as well as zoe kravitz with her excellent portrayal of selena kyle aka catwoman it paul dano riddler that really takes the film by storm however easily delivering the best villain performance in superhero film in recent memory whose zodiac style roots really intensify new look to the iconic character colin farrell is also excellent as the penguin in the film and hope we get to see more use out of him in the future perhaps the most signature thing about this film is the look bleak and gritty look into gotham underworld that really does as director matt reeves said push the limits of pg 13 film the look of the film is just outstanding and its hauntingly beautiful solemn poignancy is just wonderful to watch on screen everything true batman fan would ever want not to mention the action and fight scenes throughout this film are just brilliant easily breaking new ground and capitalizing on its darker tone in the end don have enough words to say how much loved the batman again and again one word comes to be to describe it extraordinary it may seem familiar but it unlike anything you ve seen before and in the days of superhero movies that something really freaking rare my rating 10 101.0\tthe batman creates grim gloomy atmosphere and it moves along so slowly that you could almost fall asleep to it however if you did you probably have nightmares this movie made me believe that robert pattison could be batman although not entirely sold on him as bruce wayne paul dano is disturbingly demented in his role as the riddler and colin farrell is absolutely unrecognizable as the penguin liked this new take on batman but didn love it0.0\tprobably one of the worst movies ve seen let alone batman movies penguin was the best character but hardly features catwoman was also pretty good hallmark of terrible movie is they make walk down the stairs last 45mins 3hrs long and you re still none the wiser with this movie it like the 45mins ending of lord of the rings acting casting and directing was as wet as the sea and story line wow must have been written by bunch of kids no sorry insult kids they have creativity at least there no coming back from this would consider suing for wasted time braincells and cost of my ticket but ve had all my soul sucked out and need sleep after this fyi did snooze during the movie too1.0\trobert pattinson is great loved this film but if you re reading reviews don listen to metacritic they are awful the batman lives up to the hype for sure1.0\tthe batman is reboot of the titular dc superhero film franchise directed and co written by matt reeves cloverfield dawn of the planet of the apes war for the planet of the apes starring robert pattinson in the lead role as well as zoe kravitz paul dano and colin farrell it is the best batman film to grace our screens that doesn feature any involvement from christopher nolan two years after adopting the vigilante alter ego of batman the young reclusive billionaire bruce wayne robert pattinson is summoned by police lieutenant james gordon jeffrey wright to help investigate the murder of gotham city mayor on halloween night upon closer inspection they soon learn that this killer referring to himself as the riddler paul dano intends to kill more important political figures leaving behind cryptic messages for batman in the process after deciphering some of the messages bruce discovers that the riddler motivation for these murders runs deeper than he had thought to the point where it involves not only gotham city hidden crime syndicate but also his own family legacy do really need to give detailed introduction to someone like batman he one of the most iconic superheroes of all time and everybody and their dog knows who he is there have been many films made over the years that feature the caped crusader escapades against criminals from tim burton michael keaton led movies that took the character more seriously to christopher nolan christian bale led the dark knight trilogy that are often ranked among the greatest superhero films ever made now with matt reeves vision being brought to life in the batman we have yet another fantastic depiction of this popular hero in an engaging film that embraces his detective roots many people seem to forget that in addition to fighting crime with his fists and high tech gadgets batman is also an accomplished detective his strategy of using stealth to sneak around for clues as well as his superior powers of deduction are rivalled only by the likes of sherlock holmes unfortunately this quirk hasn really been touched upon in past movies instead focusing on the action based aspects of the character likely because most casual audiences would find these moments more fun to watch that is of course until now loved how this film makes batman detective work the focal point of the story he is more pragmatic in how he tries to unravel the mystery of the riddler crimes only using brute force when absolutely necessary with that in mind the film has clearly taken influence from the detective noir movies of many decades ago like chinatown and the french connection like those two examples this one doesn focus much on action but rather the main character intellect to solve such an enigmatic puzzle personally enjoyed seeing this otherwise glanced over character trait of batman but can understand why some audiences might not think the same way as previously mentioned there isn as much action here as in other batman films so imagine there may be complaints from those who want more scenes of hand to hand combat another similarity this film has to classic noir fiction is its wonderful cinematography there are many memorable shots that show batman silhouetted among the skyline of gotham city often complimented by beautiful colour palette to help him stand out noir does literally mean black in french after all so this certainly fits character like batman to tee there one scene that takes place almost entirely in the dark and the only form of light illuminating the characters is the gunfire what would normally be difficult to see given the circumstances is made much more comprehensible thanks to matt reeves slick direction reeves makes it clear that gotham is rife with corruption and crime emphasising this by showing how nobody is without sin though bruce is morally upstanding citizen he too has skeletons in his closet regarding his family history likewise even certain members of the police department are shown to have some ties to the criminal underworld with all of these story elements coming together it should be no surprise that there is lot of ground to be covered because of this the film ends up clocking in at just under three hours in length 176 minutes to be precise again because of matt reeves solid directing by some miracle he manages to make it all work so harmoniously within the given timeframe the severity of the riddler murders taking place all over gotham city actually aids in giving the film sufficient world building we see nightclub run by the local mafia politicians lying about repairing what urgently needs to be fixed and the media manipulating facts as means to bring in ratings as result gotham feels like an actual location inhabited by real people not simply because it has used obvious new york city landmarks as its basis the gotham state building instead of the empire state building but because they all echo true to the real world which can be just as much of hellish place as something conceived in fiction perhaps even more so in addition to this the batman movies are also known for their unforgettable soundtracks tim burton films were complimented by danny elfman energetic musical score while christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy benefited strongly from hans zimmer grandiose use of horns and drums it seems we can now add michael giacchino dark brooding music to the list of memorable batman scores that many will remember years from now the main theme definitely suits the film despondent tone complete with downbeat piano notes giving it haunting feeling that all is lost also liked how the film used nirvana something in the way to convey what is going through bruce wayne mind its lyrics are metaphor for being isolated from the rest of society which is of course highly appropriate when considering bruce reclusive nature there no other working actor right now who could have played this particular incarnation of the dark knight better than robert pattinson or battinson if you will hopefully he can finally shed the shackles of that stigma he had being associated with the twilight series since he now has this role to be proud of instead pattinson depicts bruce wayne as deeply insecure man who is still reeling from the trauma of losing both his parents and this is reflected in some of his inexperience when donning the superhero uniform usually whenever we see the batman bruce wayne dynamic we are only ever shown bruce morose personality juxtaposed with batman one track minded determination here the lines are blurred as at times we can see some of bruce personal feelings getting in the way of his decision making as batman this presents an interesting point of vulnerability in the character that we don tend to see which makes him easier for the audience to identify with zoe kravitz is also great as selena kyle catwoman ve always enjoyed watching catwoman interactions with batman throughout various forms of media and the ones in this film rank up there among the very best the two have such believable chemistry since she is neither truly evil nor good essentially making her an ideal grey area character despite being of different social classes kyle downtrodden worldview resonates strongly with bruce equally pessimistic vision for the future of gotham city naturally this leads to some great will they or won they scenes that help bring spark of hope that things could turn out for the better if they both worked together but other matters always seem to prevent them from moving forward as the film main antagonist paul dano puts his own intriguing spin on the riddler instead of man dressed in green wearing hat with question mark dano riddler is draped in large poncho like outfit and mask that obscures his entire face he is an intimidating figure who always seems to be at least five steps ahead of batman and the police department the riddles he leaves behind at the crime scenes are akin to that of the real life zodiac killer with complex patterns and codes that are hard to decipher at first glance it was clever idea to make allusions to that infamous murderer especially since the mystery of who the zodiac killer really was remains unsolved to this day also playing an important role in the film is colin farrell as oswald cobblepot the penguin like batman himself this version of the penguin is still relatively inexperienced when compared to most other depictions in movies and tv shows farrell is completely unrecognisable in his makeup so much so that kept on forgetting it was him playing the character cannot discuss his significance in the story too much since that would give away important spoilers so all will say is that he leaves just as much of an impression as the riddler considering the high quality of its three predecessors the batman definitely had lot to live up to in the wake they have left behind what helped it achieve this with flying colours was the atypical direction it took things in by primarily harkening back to its detective focused origins we have something that works both as superhero film and neo noir film all rolled into one on top of that we also have unique portrayal of the main character by robert pattinson to solidify the film legacy as one of the best in the entire franchise according to matt reeves there are sequels confirmed to be on the way so if he is able to recapture lightning in bottle then exciting times lie ahead rate it solid 101.0\tmust see film for any batman fans guess that others may enjoy this too saw this in theatre today the age ranking would give is 14 ve been waiting for good batman film for 14 years now and this certainly most certainly delivers0.0\thad relatively high hopes for this film and it was promising until about the hour mark after that it was plethora of all the clichés in the book of clichés unnecessary romantic plots unnecessarily long emotional sequences and above everything unnecessary decisions made by the main characters and to top things off the movie is hours long nah0.0\treally don understand all the love for this new batman movie it was very long and boring it was filmed with no light you can barely see anything ever character is speaking just above whisper or mumble the story was weak the villains were not interesting there were couple of stupid scenes in the movie too emo batman was not cool know pattinson can act but the script and direction let him down here riddler and penguin were wasted here too bottomline this movie is way over rated save your time and money0.0\tthis movie was seriously overhyped after the awesome works of christopher nolan batman begins how could anyone compete in this case they shouldn even have tried the story is incredibly boring and illogical the villain was just plain idiot first claiming he want to punish the liars but then suddenly wanting to kill everyone including innocent civilians completely illogical also this villain suddenly gets ahold of tons and tons of explosives to blow up half the city after literally whining how poor he is makes perfect sense not this movie was just stupid watch batman begins instead with an awesome story and villain who while certainly is not less evil at least has some internal logic this didn avoid this movie0.0\tactors did fine job but storyline doesn really make you root against riddler or for batman mean if the riddler is taking out corrupt politicians and cops why should batman want to stop him so bad secondly batman is supposed to be swift like ninja but he just stands there getting shot until bad guys run out of bullets then he attacks not to mention he does really dumb things like getting shot point blank by rifles and allows bombs that are counting down to explode in his face finally they actually mention white privilege in the movie so take what you want from that0.0\tthe movie failed to make me care what happened to any of the characters the sound mix was terrible is everyone in gotham incapable of speaking above hoarse whisper the car chase was probably the biggest disappointment here great chase except they shot it through water droplets on the lense and you can actually see most of it my teen fell asleep through it and think he was the wiser of the two of us as at least he got good nap0.0\thour filmed stretched painfully over what felt like the bat mobile looks like something the a_team knocked up on sunday afternoon trapped in scrap yard rekon could have filled in this skinny batman whole movie shot in dim lighting soooooo boring over the top horror film music in scenes that lead to nothing storyline straight as die no surprises and on and on and on it went can only assume this review section is full of bots the car chase scene was absolutely diabolical the budget for this movie was low nothing happens that wasn shot on normal camera no cgi no fx when the lights went up in the cinema could feel the pain and dispair in the air an absolute snooze fest1.0\tgreetings again from the darkness riddle me this does the bat the cat and the rat sound more like an opening line to joke or the title of dr seuss book in fact those are three core elements of this new covid delayed and highly anticipated film from writer director matt reeves and co writer peter craig ll confess to being huge fan of christopher nolan dark knight trilogy that concluded 10 years ago and being bit skeptical to new version featuring robert pattinson in the titular role choosing to totally ignore the in between portrayals in the justice league movies knowing full well how important it is for fans to watch these films with fresh eyes and clear head this review is purposefully vague on what will surely prove to be some of the more popular and contentious discussion points let start with general description and the setup the film is dark and gloomy and gritty and grimy gotham is cesspool of corruption and crime and we get no glimpse into the other side assuming there is one billionaire bruce wayne robert pattinson is still in his second year as the batman often referred to as vengeance there is substantial backstory for mr wayne who lives in relative seclusion with his trusty manservant alfred pennyworth andy serkis while the batman prowls at night in his efforts to clean up the city of course he is unable to keep pace with crime and corruption even with the close alliance he has built with good cop police lt james gordon jeffrey wright it takes batman poirot like detective skills to solve riddle left as clue in particularly high profile murder case soon it obvious serial killer is at work and he has purposefully drawn the batman into his game the caped crusader proceeds to cross paths with selena kyle catwoman terrific zoe kravitz oswald cobblepot penguin an unrecognizable colin farrell district attorney gil golson peter sarsgaard and crime lord carmine falcone john turturro as city vips begin showing up dead it masked edward nashton riddler paul dano who always seems step ahead all of the above receive their chance to shine on screen and while none let us down it not until the mask is ripped from riddler and dano really shines that we are left wanting more it should be noted that farrell with his facial prosthetics and fat suit is kind of second fiddle here but it surely intentional and meant to set the stage for more penguin antics down the road pattinson will certainly receive the most scrutiny found him to be an excellent batman with black eye makeup smeared by sweat under his cowl maintaining the grungy tone his whispery voice differs from christian bale gravely growl but works for the character withdrawn nature and preference for detective work over than fighting staying true to the premise that this is only his second year there is significant shortage of wonderful toys and the batmobile is less rocket ship and more souped up coupe the contrast to these is batsuit that seems quite advanced and looks cool it pattinson bruce wayne that didn work for me respect the reclusive billionaire aspect but he mostly looks like someone on their way to nirvana gig leaving us wondering how the heck could anyone not connect the dots between creepy rich guy and nearly identical creepy guy in bat suit it minor complaint but one that stuck with me oscar winning composer michael giacchino up 2009 takes more classical approach than the dramatics of predecessors hans zimmer and danny elfman giacchino has been frequent pixar contributor and scored some well known blockbusters in franchises like jurassic world star trek planet of the apes mission impossible spider man and star wars his work fits nicely here adapting characters and stories originated by bob kane and bill finger matt reeves and peter craig have found way to put their own stamp on the work mr craig is oscar winner sally field son and his previous scripts include the town 2010 parts and of the hunger games mockingjay and upcoming high profile projects in top gun maverick and gladiator director reeves has previously helmed the excellent horror film let me in 2010 as well as dawn of the planet of the apes 2014 and war for the planet of the apes 2017 this marks the first in planned batman trilogy and couple of the last scenes seemingly set the stage for what to come although this is an odd movie here hoping the franchise maintains this tone and avoids the typical marvel dc overblown cgi approach after all the batman is but one man not god of superpowers this film is an unusual blend of noir horror detective action psychological thriller wrapped in gray box with black bow and though it will likely be divisive among fans isn everything this hour epic leaves us anticipating the next bat time and bat channel opens wide in theaters on march 20220.0\tthis is not the batman we can relate to it absurdly unconvincing it painfully slow hope there isn sequel to this the cinematography and editing is very good0.0\twhen movie started thought it ll be interesting with new plot line and new villains but director and writing department both lack vision they wrote whole movie without batman actual goal or vision and robert pattinson literally have only 20 lines whole movie he just walking or riding bike like seriously where the story there are no good action sequence as well except last 5mins of the movie also in one scene bomb exploded right in front of batman and he didn have single scratch are you serious zoe catwoman who made her actress and most importantly who selected her mask for catwoman her mask looks like my grandfather monkey cap her acting is so bad when she has dialogues it seems like she half asleep and couldn deliver it the whole movie was the question what the purpose of the movie and why so poor writing0.0\tactually walked out of cinema before the end stupid boring no story bad acting batman brought fists to gun fight imagine how they insult our intelligence trying to make him the winner think people on tiktok can make better job don mind mistakes am walking to my car and writing only good thing was popcorn and drink bought0.0\tsome cool action scenes but doesn deliver on the detective side of batman the dialogue was also really bad most people either yelled or tried talking in these silly deep voices and in this case it wasn batman it was the chiefs of police and gordon they just didn work zoe kravitz was good as cat woman pattinson was actually good as batman but not good bruce wayne alfred was pointless the script over all just wasn that good the cinematography could have been better too they tried to be different with their realistic camera angles but mostly they failed it missed the marked and lastly it was too long and too slow0.0\twhat steaming pile of depressing nonstop raining scenes we ve never seen that before pattinsons acting is so flat it seemed like he needed some anti depressants he winces and reacts while getting punched kicked yet is able to withstand being shot by bullets really hmm as if the message in black panther wasn clear enuf here we have another go at promoting cheap shots once again at you guessed it how is it ok for catwoman to spew wh te privi lege as oles as reference towards the population that ruining gotham just great stuff an all out attack just imagine the repercussions of this same type of diatribe against other races or ethnicities it just not cool0.0\twe never saw batman unintelligent weak and uncertain about everything he do the way robert pattinson did it suppose all the other batman is crying over their lost legacy selecting the actors could easily do more better0.0\tthere good film hidden between what is nothing but self indulgent filler unfortunately the filler makes up at least of the run time curious in the director insistence he wanted to create realistic version of batman rather than superhero think to achieve that you need to at least imply your hero is somewhat hurt or even out of breath after taking on gang of gun wielding thugs assume actually showing blood when someone is having their skull caved in would help too you also need to show emotion of some sort the only actor who shows modicum of range here is paul dano which is why it rather than from me what we ended up with was wish version of se7en mixed with blade runner disastrous narration0.0\tvery boring so don waste time as well as don waste money for batman so everybody must be feal stressful after hearing batsman long moral conversation and the bad thing about this your spend money for buying tickets so you can not want to leav the cinema hall you have to listen the knowledge from batman about wrong and wright for mast of his conversion and little bit mony making people who are use ther mony power wrong thing about it you have not any openings from your brain is thinking another plots of storry for yor mind and batman has their own narrative0.0\tit has certainly got good parts but overall boring annoyingly slow and long movie at almost 3hrs it not batman and not even good crime thriller perhaps different cast would have helped not sure why so many people think this was great0.0\tjust invert the roles make everyone black white and everyone white black but keep the same exact script do you think hollywoke would allow you to even shoot that movie get woke go broke assure everyone that this movie will follow the same path as disney star wars the force awakens everyone will be fooled into love it at first but after analyzing it people will gradually start to hate it0.0\tthe fact that so many people like this debacle of film shows you that we re living in the time of idiocracy you would have to be simpleton or feeble minded to find this movie very entertaining the fact that the entire movie is set in nearly complete darkness made you want to fall asleep all throughout the entire film1.0\tdark gritty and great the batman has never been better with robert pattison vanishes into the role of the caped crusader stalking the rain soaked streets of gotham city cesspool of crime and corruption while unravelling the grotesque murders of city officials at the hands of the terrifying riddler tonally bleak and unapologetically violent director matt reeves effectively borrows from classic thrillers such as se7en to give us version of the bat never seen before the detective at almost three hours the epic story unfolds and introduces an array of gruff seedy underworld characters from carmine falcone john turturro catwoman zoe kravitz and the penguin who is played by colin farrell in an absolutely amazing transformation fully realized vision from characters costumes set design and action this is the best version of batman ever seen onscreen0.0\tthe story is all over the place looks like someone picked up an old detective film script and tried to shove batman story in there somewhere acting is fine sometimes but actors has given nothing to work with chemistry between batman and catwoman is so shallow that puddle of piss would look deeper and in the god name can someone please tell the director that shooting the whole movie in dark is not some sort of art ohhh and the editing think they forgot to edit the bloody thing why wouldn everyone love piss poor script shot in cave to watch for hours0.0\treally wanted too like this but it just didn get my motor runing too be honest not hole lot liked about it besides the amazing makeup job they did on colin farrell otherwise not much comes to mind0.0\toh gosh it bit hard to summerize the movie watched it yesterday but almost cannot remember anything as it was soooo forgetable and boring full of clichés the plot is predictable conversations are empty action scenes provide nothing new don even try to compare it to nolan masterpiece yikes0.0\tfeel like just saw the husband of the corpse bride dressed as batman and the most emo version of bruce wayne it was also unclear to me if the theater went to had the sound set wrong or they were trying to compensate for batman low voice by turning the volume up have never enjoyed movie so little1.0\tthe darkest batman adaptation even the first one with bomb beautifully filmed with the amazing writing and oh man paul dano was masterful as riddler and think robert pattinson was one of the best batman only minor thing to budge through is the length even that was worth it all the through especially the imax format made everything better was little annoyed someone got their seat late and wanted me and my sister to move down even though had my ticket for few weeks that was ridiculous they were lucky didn feel like saying much cause to nice for my own good not only that stuff family thought ben affleck batman was better hell to the no anyway love how ratings are close to dark knight the batman deserves so much praise0.0\tthe batman is not movie it actually just four part mini series that is shown one after the other in one piece as film just like dune and many other new movies that are unnecessarily long tell the story extremely slow and seem to last forever what wrong with 90 minute or at most hour movie what wrong with fast paced movie with lots of action why do movies suddenly have to be hours long or more this makes most movies boring that goes for dune tenet and many others and it also goes for this movie the batman had the film been an hour shorter the simple story could have been told fascinatingly as it should be in movie but now the film drags on like soap opera with long winded shots of stares and boring dialogue that add nothing to it even the music shamelessly borrowed from john williams cannot ad any to it it can still be good movie when cut down to 90 minutes in fact only the last james bond movie has managed to captivate the viewer for hours but all the other more than hour films of recent times all bear the stamp of the hbo netflix prime apple and disney series slowness to keep the viewer streaming as long as possible so they don go to the competitor for part miniseries would have given the batman stars for 90 minute movie probably starts but now it deserves no more than0.0\tthis is the first time fell asleep watching batman movie in imax hugely disappointing story was mediocre action sequence was miniscule compared to the trilogy created by christopher nolan batman looked like psychopath the movie failed to wow me even for minute if its trilogy am not watching the future releases0.0\tthere are not enough words to describe how boring was this movie story that we have seen so many times already and you tried to unsuccessfully twist it the whole movie was really dark and almost no scenes during the day what were you trying to hide robert very poor acting probably that is why they showed him just three times without mask1.0\tfor two years matt revess and robert pattinson beat up all the doubters in the back streets of gotham you may or may not like it as movie but it is fact that we watched great batman and great bruce wayne1.0\tbatman has had lots of movies through the years and he did bit of detective work but not much so this movie obviously wanted to showcase this ability of the batman and it does so very well having very good set of villains as this riddler is much more what am used to in the comics the penguin is not some mutated dude raised by penguins and corruption is the key to everything we get new batman in robert pattison and he does very good job more dark and brooding and without all the growling and shouting of bale the movie is dark and just very interesting as it truly had me wondering who and what was the endgame however there is action so do not let people try to say that the film is absent of some good old punching the story key political figures are being dispatched first it is the mayor the person responsible leaves chilling riddles behind and seems to be taking an interest in batman who is already batman so no origin story here batman is already working with gordon and looks over the crime scene soon things start to point to this person or that and even bruce father may have part in it as the riddler game turns out to be even more heinous than even batman could guess pattison was very good as batman he was not super muscular like the batman in the comics but really the only guy who pumped up for the role was ben affleck batman would put robert in tie with bale in second as they both look fit but not really jacked up colin is great as the penguin and was totally surprised to find andy serkis was alfred kept thinking know him from somewhere but guess just did not think of the actor as old enough to be alfred zoe kravitz is rather good catwoman not quite michelle but better than the one from rising the batmobile rather liked like the batmobile fused with mad max vehicle so this film was good would say it is my fave batman but one always tends to fall in love with something when they see it for the first time so ll hold judgement am very curious to see where this is going and if they team up who think they are going to team up that would be really cool definitely think robert can do the job was not fan of twilight but come on everyone has to get their start somewhere and he was so dark in this film most will forget that he ever sparkled0.0\timagine rich guy going broke having mental breakdown and deciding for no reason whatsoever to dress like bat ok can do that so far maket it black and white give it mumbly dialog characters with no development and badly written story there you have it the batman 20220.0\tthis was not bad movie pattinson does great job and enjoyed some of it however it takes itself way too seriously for movie about man who dresses as bat it also did not need to be hours long my other complaint is about the complete lack of female voices we get one female character and she dressed in bustier and leather the entire movie overall it was fine but didn say or do anything that justified new movie franchise1.0\tthe batman feels like the definitive take on the titular caped crusader sprawling dark and epic story that finally puts batman detective skills front and centre whilst having ample commentary on today society robert pattinson gives perfect lead performance as bruce wayne batman that different to what come before bruce wayne who only lives to be batman and carries visible pain and trauma in every scene he also manages to do so much with so little able to convey lot with just simple look or turn zoë kravitz is an excellent catwoman with her own pain and history and has all the necessary charisma and style paul dano is an absolutely terrifying riddler having plenty of unsettling and loud outbursts of rage skillfully counterbalanced with quiet whispers also notable performances include an unrecognisable colin farrell jeffrey wright who is superb gordon and surprisingly active andy serkis alfred who manages to do lot with little and john turturro who is icily cold and satisfyingly restrained as carmine falcone matt reeves direction is incredible gotham is at its most fully realized with nice balance of realism and comic book extravagance action sequences are all extremely unique and are therefore able to standout with the car chase in particular being an unforgettable set piece the pacing is also perfect able to make it three hour runtime fly by due to something always happening without feeling rushed the music by michael giacchino is instantly iconic like the rest of the film it able to find it own voice and style that different to what come before1.0\thad been waiting for this film ever since saw it first teaser trailer at the dc fandome in 2020 now that it out and ve watched it gotta say it been well worth the wait this movie is just blast from start to end possibly the darkest batman movie ever even more so than the dark knight loved robert pattinson as batman but it paul dano who gave me the chills every scene he was in colin farell penguin has lot of potential to be great antagonist in future films would love sequel for this film also do these negative reviewers think they can drop the rating of the film just by saying nonsensical things like why is the film so dark 3rd act really boring and all that stuff advise you grow up cause batman films are supposed to be dark0.0\tunwatchable crap yet they just keep making more and more do our universities not graduate writers every year where do they go obviously not hollywood sure they will make few more then we will move on to another actor and the same old story wash rinse repeat1.0\talways been batman fan as the legend is my favorite superhero and watching all of the movies from the classic 1989 one every so often the fans see that the series changes tone and feel as it rebooted the batman directed by matt reeves is dark take with conflict as batman deals with city underworld of secrets while serial killings are happening and the hope and chance for romance struts right in front of him gotham has serial killer on the loose and with each victim found strange puzzle like word clues are left as batman investigates the mystery and things become complex as it all tied into world of city officials and underworld crime figures are connected to them plus secrets come up as batman himself is wrapped up into this wicked game the film chemistry and cast of characters are top notch with young star robert pattinson filling out the bat suit just fine and zoe kravitz is raw and outspoken as selina kyle slash friend and foe love interest of the bat colin farrell was well made up as the penguin thru it all combined with fire blazing action and kick butt punches the batman is compelling drama with suspense and revealing secrets of gotham city officials as crime boss carmine falcone is lead figure to all of this the batman is in depth and dark new reboot style take on the legend as it good film still not the best still if batman and fan you will enjoy as the film rubs off feel from many of the graphic novels as to get more understanding read the dark knight returns or the long halloween1.0\tin short reeves has the merit of showing that batman can turn out to be very different version from what was previously perfectly explored by nolan this is more thoughtful more investigative and even darker batman not in hurry to show all his cards even with an excessive long duration and some unnecessary expository dialogue it passes the difficult test with flying colours1.0\tthe batman gives us 6th film version of bruce wayne in robert pattinson and lot of people are asking do we need another batman film after watching this the answer is yes from the director of the last two great planet of the apes films this is brooding and dark true to form batman film much closer to tim burton films than the snyder schumacher films it has some aspects in similar with the nolan trilogy but is different enough to stand alone this is younger batman bruce and does well to not re tell the story of his parents deaths essential to any good batman film is good alfred and serkis is great the entire cast is really good selina kravitz lieutenant gordon wright the riddler dano falcone turturro and oswald penguin farrell who is literally unrecognisable in his make up dano brings great energy to the riddler and makes him seem realistic in the world we live in definitely no trace of jim carey here the scenes with bruce selina work really well while this is very dark both visually and thematically including the repeated use of nirvana something in the way it really suits the noir vibe of the mystery that has bruce gordon trying to solve the riddler puzzles murders they make gotham very believable always raining and there great car chase scene as well as plenty of realistic hand to hand combat while it long almost hours it doesn drag and the pacing is good with the non action components being as exciting as the fight scenes by the end was certainly convinced by the validity of pattinson the suit and this film1.0\tthere is lot to like about the new batman film the sound design cinematography and the fight and stunt choreography are its strongest aspects but after nearly three hours left both exhausted and disappointed the soundtrack grows repetitive as does the film unrelenting dark tone and above all else quite frankly very little stands out here very little that isn executed in my eyes much better in the nolan trilogy the performances from gordon to alfred to batman himself aren memorable enough aren engaging enough to keep the audience invested and to let go of the versions of these characters they ve grown to know and love from the nolan trilogy the batman is not bad film it does have plenty of excellent scenes and moments but it fails to break any new ground and distinguish itself from previous batman entries also the batmobile is letdown0.0\tthe movie might have looked bit like some of david fincher movies in terms of cinematography gothicness and poignantly dealing with trauma but it really lacked his depth alluring writing and overall vibe same thing if we compare it to nolan batman the movie was mediocre at best and that makes me feel disappointed0.0\tve seen campy batman movies from joel schumacher ve seen more grounded realistic batman movies from christopher nolan and ve even seen goofy batman movie from chris mckay but there one thing never in my life thought see boring batman movie matt reeves pulled off that unlikely feat with this hour long drudgery of film admittedly coming at this as person who has never clicked with the character of the dark knight find batman to be massively overrated and struggle to see why the entire world bows down to him as if he the greatest superhero of all time that being said can still find entertainment from his stories and rarely have outright hatred for the films aside from when zack snyder directs them the batman feels like film made after matt reeves spent great deal of time reading fan discussions on the internet so it ticks number of the boxes that ve heard comic book nerds complain about over the years they make point of never having batman kill anyone mean one could argue few received head wounds that could easily lead to their death and he caused car crash that could easily have been fatal but at least he not pulling out gun on anyone or dropping people off the top of building also all those fanboys love to talk about batman being the world greatest detective so in this movie the first time we see the caped crusader he literally walking into an active crime scene it ridiculous juxtaposition that made me chuckle but sure there were some people out there who wanted to applaud that moment the other aspect of the batman that had me chuckling when don think they intended anything to actually be funny was when we meet bruce wayne outside of the mask first of all there another bit of fan service in the fact that we actually see him with black makeup smeared around his eyes but worse than that is just the exaggerated emo goth kid look that makes it appear that robert pattinson is cosplaying as gerard way from my chemical romance there were more than few scenes where we are looking at bruce wayne through bunch of long greasy black bangs and was wondering who thought that was good idea will give pattinson credit for not overdoing the batman voice too much and almost always disguising his native british accent as said at the start though the big problem with the batman is just the fact that it boring the film drags on and even the action sequences feel kind of bland and lacking in memorable moments there one car chase that stands out as the biggest moment where was literally checking the time because it added nothing to the plot of the film the entire plot is non stop series of tropes that feel like watching someone who wants to do tarantino style homage to other crime thrillers but without the talent of tarantino the story is slow moving and insanely repetitive could not believe how many times they returned to the same places and did the same things there was complete lack of efficiency in the storytelling as if no one was willing to cut anything and felt there were entire characters and storylines that could have easily gone without hurting the story one bit the entire movie is built around big puzzle which can get behind it started developing as though there was genuine murder mystery for us to uncover but as things started to move along it became clear they didn have reveal that would warrant all the time they spent building it up as side note think ll be happy if never again have to see scene where person is questioned about who is the big bad behind everything and they say they can tell because something worse than death will happen to them this only works as stupid stalling technique to build suspense for the audience and if you don have satisfactory surprise pay off at the end it totally ridiculous needless to say the batman did not have said pay off its biggest surprise was that it wouldn end because they constantly had one more scene in every way found the batman to be lackluster movie that somehow made me nostalgic for the days of schumacher0.0\twow there is so much to dislike about the bayman am not sure where to begin big noir fan but this is hours blacked out nonsense actors and action sequences are unrecognizable and worse adam west is no longer the worst batman there are at least 10 scenes on the film that are too long like the editor quit in post this should have been hour movie thank god for zoe kravitz john turturro and jeffrey wright all admirable attrociously disappointing1.0\tdidn know what to expect coming into the film but it left me more excited about anything involving dc character since dc jumped into the combined universe template after marvel matt reeves did an incredible job and there are only few narrative elements that left me thinking it could be bit better the acting is quality the story is gritty and the character arcs are well done true score 100.0\tquality director is irreplaceable period missed chris nolan through every minute of this sheer torture that endured in the cinema hall how do you break out from under the shadow of dark knight trilogy how do you distinguish yourself you don this was travesty did by mistake enter theatre screening bad third class copy of se7en batman picking blood samples like sherlock holmes and doing detective work in cahoots with gotham pd it was shocker then lets talk about miscasting robert pattinson is not bruce wayne he never will be man child with unkempt hair is not bruce wayne you dont distinguish your film from previous editions by forbidding your actors to look presentable the angst of bruce wayne is not reflected by his unkempt hair and appearance it comes from within every ounce of bruce wayne reflects that dark side underneath those designer suits and slick hair christian bale did it to perfection ben affleck did it very well what we saw in this movie was an untidy man child no efforts were made to even spend minutes on what led this man child to this pitiable state nirvana songs in the background cant rescue pathetic mash up of se7en and other detective films the villains were clownish the story was haywire my favourite super hero who is not super hero was ruined destroyed by this sherlock holmes outing hope that dc will end this travesty here next time would like to meet bruce wayne and batman not dirty man child in need of prison bath0.0\tnot sure why this is rated so highly this was the worst batman movie ever loved the batman trilogy with christian bale but this was just long and boring0.0\teverything was going so mediocrely to begin and then they hit us with it the white privilege bomb what in god name does white privilege have anything to with anything going on in this movie another contrived dig at white people so unnecessarily when is hollywood gonna give up on this nonsense and keep their politics out of the plot maybe never maybe ll never pay for movie again in that case0.0\tliked the new batman approach but bit elmo style the movie was far too long it was basically just watching series of hollywood cliche scenes one after the other shot against very dark backgrounds the plot could have been much more intelligent and def shorter the new batman is original alfred didn work catwoman was too predictable the gangsters were straight out of 1940s movie half way through was still hoping that the movie would redeem itself but vengeance never arrived the ruddler was poorly drawn and not clever enough so in conclusion an original take on batman character but not enough to keep me interested should you see it yes but bring sandwiches and red bull along it going to be very long dark night1.0\tfor hero movie three hours is bold attempt at the same time with serious tone of narrative it is extremely brave challenge like the joker this novel tries its best to create three dimensional character at the same time with ups and downs of the story the success of the character image more rich and full at the expense of course the other characters are somewhat weak compared to the main characters and this also leads to some of the emotional depiction is bit abrupt which is regrettable however whether it is dazzling brilliance or shocking sound effects or excellent screenplay number of advantages all make this is high quality work that cannot be overshadowed by flaws and as the new batman pattinson also with mature acting presented qualified answer1.0\tapproaching this review holistically as my favorite batman is kevin conroy sorry live action movies my credentials an average fan have read most of the detective and batman comics watched most the dc animated shows and movies as well as live action films and played all the arkham games and also the telltale series to avoid spoilers just commenting on the actual acting more than plot didn like the batman voice but midway through it grew on me acting wise mr pattinson is impressive but my favorite roles of his are as neil cedric diggory and rev teagardin as batman remember this is bats in year and mr pattinson nails it as well fine actor not better than mr keaton but that is childhood nostalgia maybe however just as batty as mr bale mr affleck was awesome as well but scripting for him was below par ms kravitz was maybe born to play selina at least this gritty version honestly disliked ms kravitz in men and grindlewald but liked her in big little lies was skeptical given her lack of martial arts but it is evident she gave her best during training and for me her portrayal of selina was perfect chemistry wise though needed some work between bats and cats but nothing worth losing star over mr dano wow saw like sadist perhaps inspired by mr spacey bit riddler far from the kooky riddle me this we have come to know and enjoy but he gave in performance no less than his stellar efforts with daniel day lewis have become fan of mr dano acting mr serkis just when thought re imagining might go awry there is mr serkis he portrays alfred so naturally it as if he is alfred pennyworth mr wright is fair enough gordon and without any fault of his once you ve seen him as felix leiter as he was the best leiter for me it hard to not compare his take on gordon with leiter also once you ve seen mr oldman in and as anything well mr oldman is my best gordon like mr simmons is my best jjjameson mr farrell was believable budding cobblepot and hope he brings the same effort to the supposed spinoff suffice to say also had enjoyed his take on bullseye but inbruges is till my best for mr farrell mr turturro is limited but still impactful as was mr skarsgard direction plot appreciate good work and mr reeves clearly put in an honest effort enjoyed his vision and never felt bored or distracted whilst watching his movie he is not mr nolan or mr burton or mr timm mr dini but league of his own and in this he owned it thank you for not messing it up story wise the movie is entertaining and well made there is threat hero and allies must work to show their relevance and save the day done quite effectively not life changing but films rarely are however storytelling is meaningful obviously production values are impressive and the cinematography is amazing set designs are useful while costumes are well thought out and used relevantly overall 10 out of 10 from me vinaka from fiji1.0\tmatt reeves the batman is one of the greatest comic book films of all time and if you don agree sorry but you are wrong you literally are just trying to be different and unique if you say you don like this movie it true detective story it dark it violent and it pure batman through and through robert pattinson is big screen magic as well as everyone else in this masterpiece it is clearly one of the best batman films ever made it certainly beats out the dark knight rises and batman begins even go as far to say that it is equally as perfect as the dark knight the film is spectacular0.0\tleft the movie after 30 minutes watching it it was very boring the acting was very bad and the movie itself is very slow wonder how the rating was too high these days everything is fake maybe ratings are fake too don waste your time1.0\tlikes the acting strong opening for much of the film the batman cast excels where other directions in the dc movies have not hit so hard jeffrey wright is wonderful commissioner gordon he got great character development with wonderful delivery of the frustration he is facing in this mystery kravitz as the new selena kyle is the blend of physical and emotional acting that this character holds being one of the best catwoman roles in long time she got the moves during the fights but the heart of the anti hero is solid and great opposite to the bat in this game of uncovering the truth as for all the other characters could go on paragraphs alone of how well they hit their marks in this blend of modern with classic batman but can say reeves has helmed quite cast to bring this new approach to life as for pattinson did not hate him and feel he pulled the tenet and lighthouse acting into role that is dark foreboding and angry as expected in the first two years of the bat career from story aspect it works and pattinson manages to pull some great punches into handling the emotional role while the broodiness makes for simplistic and monotone character that pales to the others in this film the world building reeves has done great job establishing the new direction with the gotham city and pulls you into just how dark and dingy the city of batman is while tim burton style was playful whimsical architecture that captured lots of styles reeves take is more realistic and feels very much like city in need of cleaning up all the shadows the designs of the clubs and buildings have shed the comic book feeling and instead dove into more of the graphic novel realism approach that goes so well with the story it sets the stage for lots of story potential in what will most likely have sequels and offers many facets of the city to make an ecosystem that batman will be playing in all the designs and new angles they took were wonderful for me and the story elements for our bat to face will evolve well if done right the cinematography it good and reeves has indeed shot great movie that looks beautiful on just simple screen the shadows tell lots of stories in this movie with plenty of angles and use to establish the mood and dangers of the criminal world we are in filters that add grey help further add the foreboding nature of this film giving us the feeling that even light does not bring safety in this seven like approach they took even the angles taken for how light serves as temporary reprieve are shot beautifully with so much captured in the lighting and angles each shot meticulously planned to give you the optimum emotion and punch that they needed this is film that will do well in the imax films and will probably look even better on and advanced screen the costumes makeup have to give him props to the wardrobe makeup team because they have accomplished wonders in this film the bat suit looks good it dark it basic and fits the early years approach they are taking quite well like an early spiderman suit from marvel though the eye issues are still present the rest of the group has some style to it and keeps the realistic edge of the movie but still holds the comic book basis that we love to see in this franchise throw in wigs outfits for little more elevation and there is nice style that many will enjoy for one reason or the other the biggest achievement though is the penguin makeup and just the transformation they did to the actor to make him into the future villain we know him to be the action scenes to level as this movie gears towards realism the action fits the themes as well bringing bouts that feel as if they can actually happen and not quite as cartoony as the old batman movies when guys take punches they feel it and get some shiners in the process leading to more street brawling and timing hits than the spectacles of coordination catwoman moves are sleek and stylish and also have level of planning that again goes with the themes of the film and don go too elaborate even the chase scene holds more realism to it and though has little more octane added to the mix keeps itself grounded compared to most modern day car chase sequences these fights hold more emotional stakes than anything with reeves again infusing storytelling atmosphere to the shots that sort of illustrates the struggles our characters are facing that symbolic nature gets thumbs up in terms of the balance it gives and how there is an anchor between physical action and the character development with it the plot hands down the best part of this movie for me is the storytelling they are doing with this film and how it works with the three hours it has the batman is much darker take on an already dark series taking the elements from the nolan series and further swimming down into the tales this film has to offer while there are plenty of symbolism moments that many will enjoy the true genius is the mystery at hand within the riddler game what starts out as an homage to the crime genre quickly blends the riddler love of games with the new twist of deadliness not found in other media realistic danger that is very relevant to today world with the race against the clock the stakes and the mystery all dancing around pieces of information that talk more about our characters it captivating moment that will get your intrigue going and keep you hooked through most of the movie this is the biggest strength for me in this movie and certainly major supporting pillar for this film to base itself on dislikes batman bruce wayne portrayal can say that enjoyed the brooding anguished and monotone bruce wayne who bled into the same thing during batman understand that there are often very little differences between the two in the medium but other batman movies have tried to utilize the alter egos little more than what this installment did pattinson was fine in acting it out but the fact they could not do more with the two personas to help gather more clues and keep the trail off of him little better makes for flatter batman that again is sort of weaker than the other characters in the film more alfred ironically really liked this alfred we got and this butler character has been staple to the franchise for longer than ve been alive while serkis performance is stellar the class emotion and depth all there ready to go must say they sort of short seated him more than they did batman and robin legendary character more time was needed with alfred perhaps to help elevate the bruce wayne moments or perhaps to put his own hat in the ring of solving the riddler mystery while serkis manages to maximize the small amount of time with quality acting this is the character wanted more of in this film to help keep the quality performances coming and the promise of what is to come in this latest franchise the action to another degree know this movie was going for something different taking the realistic and brooding approach compared to the man in tights feel we ve gotten several times it does not mean it had to be devoid of special effects and hollywood magic to the point of being little too plain and simplified for my superhero taste the action of the batman needs bit more spice for people like me mixing some big time score little more coordination and gadgets we love and trying to add little more comic book element to relieve some of the darker tones as said the action plays to the rules well but the lack of adding sound editing an upbeat score and variety to the fights makes the action part of this movie little dull for me much of the film is really more about that brutality and anger component something symbolism guys will eat up but to not add little variety until the very end which is still not that spiced up makes for bit of boring and bland batman film too much in one film always think that studios try to do too much in one movie and push one or two steps too far to try and get all the stuff in the batman is movie that think took one or two steps that needed to be pulled back leading to some components feeling bit forced not needed or dare say semi complete in my book this film has lot of staples in the film and while many of them are fantastically blending there are other that are combed over and left vague probably for the plans read about the franchises to come sadly like disney it seems wb is using this film as springboard for an entire world of cinema and those qualities sort of showed as hooks to reel you in to remakes and redos of batman stories the invincible suit you ve seen the trailers enough time to know that this batman seems to have suit made by iron man and can say big fan of it all the realism the bland fights and the emotions are fine and dandy but to throw it all away by making batman suit that can take lot of fire and have little repercussions takes away from the danger element in these moments while know batman has had some blows bounce off most of the batman media puts lot more danger that requires him to fight smarter displaying batman intellect and preparation this film though makes his prototype first suit better than most of his later models leaving me rolling my eyes at the absurdity of how proof his suit is in this installment while the ending finally cracks that code it broken mechanic and my least favorite aspect of the movie due to how much it breaks the mold of what reeves established in this movie my scores for this film are action crime drama movie overall1.0\tout of the deep dark depths of gotham city comes the newest addition to one of the best known franchises the batman starring robert pattinson is thrilling chilling and jam packed with action we all know and love batman but this stellar cast will show you deeper darker side of him and other characters who have been loved and hated for generations the batman is an exciting addition to the dc universe but does not follow the original dark knight trilogy this new film follows beloved hero batman as he tracks down series of murders of gotham most powerful people he is given clues written in cryptic codes that he has to decipher all while the deviously smart and insane riddler paul dano is killing off important people one by one from history of lies in corrupt city and in battle over the true meaning of justice comes the new dc film that will get in your mind and stay there from the moment the lights of the theater dimmed and the movie started was hooked have never been fan of movies that waste time getting to the meat of the story and the batman wastes no time this film is full of suspense and the music is one of the major components that contributes to that in intense situations atmosphere is everything and the music by oscar winning composer michael giacchino creates the perfect amount of eeriness and tension robert pattinson acting is also incredible this batman speaks very little but his body language and facial expressions speak volumes was extremely impressed by how real and broken pattison makes his character seem and have never seen this protagonist reach depths like this in other batman stories the one thing in this movie would have liked to see more of is the story behind batman technology he seems to have million gadgets but the audience doesn know exactly what they are or where they came from the message of this film is that vengeance won change the past but helping others can change the future big part of this film is about justice and what that means in the end we see that justice isn about killing or hurting others justice is about taking what is wrong and fixing it by doing the right thing justice does not equal bloody revenge give the batman out of stars and recommend it to ages 13 to 17 plus adults you can see the batman in theatres on march 2022 by allison kids first0.0\tbetween an insipid robert pattinson and woeful story line coupled with an awful script there really was no trajectory but down for this embarrassing rendition was very eager to see this new take on the batman franchise and all you could do was pray for the end to speedily come along and you waited and waited in vain for the tragedy to end and it just wouldn people around me and should mention they were unknown to me fell asleep during the movie they should be grateful for their escape please consider yourself forewarned it is unrelentingly boring1.0\tthe iconic character of bruce wayne batman has been brought to the big screen several times tim burton great batman 1989 and batman returns 1992 were tribute to the comic book style then came christopher nolan trilogy with plots more focused on neo noir and with darker comic style this 2022 matt reeves launches his vision of the bat the batman with an intriguing script that mixes neo noir and psychological thriller the work of the cinematographer is of higher level the camera movements are daring and that dark quite gothic atmosphere is captivating the soundtrack is incredible as well as great job by the sound department the direction of matt reeves is totally successful and the performances are tremendous robert pattinson once again demonstrates his histrionic capacity but the performances that deserve standing ovation are those of zoë kravitz and paul dano not fan of superhero movies but the batman is an amazing production that provides an effective story with decadent atmosphere in gotham city an intelligent movie for minds that like to think and not the typical superhero movie with simple stories0.0\tjudas priest where do you start it like someone gave matt reeves the keys to 300m car and he went right out and crashed it listen you can out nolan nolan why try seems that reeves can only do remakes reeves took big budget action film and turned it into some wanna be film school art house picture with obscure angles bad lighting major pacing problems and mon if you re gonna spring to have collin ferrel in the movie let him be recognizable this movie is horrible and pretentious movie that should ve been 90 minutes and stretched to 180 the only soundtrack is 150 minutes of ave maria oh and the same nirvana song twice and people you give 10 star ratings to 10 star movies like godfather and casa blanca not comic book movies whomever is rating this above is plant fake reviewers it sh movie and actually mad spent the time and money to watch it please don let reeves crash any more cars ans sure as he don let him do sequel0.0\twhat we ve got from matt reeves emo batman being pg movie you see man is beating to pulp being hit so hard but not one single scratch on his face batman is shoot with many bullets but the bullets doesn hit his face this is the reason pg pg13 movies are horrible and far away from reality the batman movies musy be rated look at snyder version the best version of batman have ever seen don care what snyder haters says very bad interpretation of the ridler many of us including me expected very good performance from dano but it fails who btw he kinda disappear from the movie for about one hour whaaaaat cat woman is horrendous as b1 3xu ebony in 95 of comics she is white woman the pinguin is not what we see in the comics it just guy with visible prostethics acting weird and boring officer gordon being black dude nothing against black actors is just silly when in all the comics he is white dude why can you respect the comics unconvincing twists the movie try to be dark and gritty but the feeling is they tried too hard and the almost hours we get almost nothing impresive pattinson as batman it even worse than bale who btw was so cringy as batman with that goofy voice and the most overrated batman ever for me will get so many thumbs down don even care ben affleck was the best batman wayne till date stars out of 10 for the good music score and for few action scenes the majority are just bland and chaotic mess nothing compare with the snyder warehouse batman fighting scene who is one of the best fighting scene in superhero movie1.0\tit may have been the hype it may be that have watcheda lot of movies or it may be that really love the nolan trilogy or all of them combined but this movie didn reach any of them but it doesn mean it is bad movie at all first the good things the acting is good the action is good the world building is good the detective side of batman is probably the best side of this film but the problem is that none of them are impressive just good kept expecting the movie to riddle my mind or some kind of heavy plot twist like in se7en since it has similar vibe or at least some dialogue that sticks to my brain and gets me thinking about the villains perspective like joker did several times and any of the nolan villains for that matter it wasn bad paul dano did great with what he had and so did most of the actors it just that their characters were not very well written and there are many plot holes in the end don go in with high expectations otherwise you will not enjoy it but it is still respectable effort1.0\tthis was the perfect batman reboot this film had everything giving it dark cop thriller mystery to it but also the characters were great they made the riddler creepy and crazy but not in joker kind of way they gave catwoman very good story in the film and penguin was awesome and can wait for his show but batman was definitely the best giving him super dark feel with some kind of heart but this film was the perfect reboot and in my opinion is the second best batman film yet highly recommend watching this if you can it is fantastic film and can wait for more films to come out now0.0\tthis movie was so beyond terrible very disappointed because this movie received insane amounts of hype before it release was extremely excited when walked into the theatre however it didn take me long to figure out that was going to be miserably disappointed the first thing that noticed was that the cast was absolutely terrible the actors and actresses didn fit their roles whatsoever please fire whoever idea it was to make the guy from black panther alfred wanted to claw my eyes out while watching him in this piece of garbage in addition it was boring and slow paced it was mostly the police the entire movie didn pay to come watch police movie paid for an authentic batman experience urge everyone who is contemplating whether to use their 15 to pay for tickets to save their money and just buy the dark knight instead the dark knight is cinematic masterpiece that blows this trash out of the water this doesn deserve to even have the title of the batman and honestly would definitely be open to trying to get it permanently changed this embarrassing lazy writing should be called batman and the police find psycho in slow paced excruciatingly boring manner so at least the title isn as misleading to potential viewers like myself as either way they ll surely leave the cinema frustrated and underwhelmed1.0\tthe market has not only been saturated but flooded with superhero movies of divergent quality over the past decade and half apparently people just can seem to be getting enough as the batman has received much praise as reviewers already claimed it to be the greatest film of the year only two months into it is this massive hype justified as usual the truth lies somewhere in between the extremes as matter of fact the batman is certainly one of the better superhero movies does it have the quality of christopher nolan the dark night no it doesn can it equal the excellent performances in todd phillips joker no it can however there are several positive elements worth to be pointed out first and foremost the movie oozes with sinister atmosphere from start to finish the movie uses excellent lighting techniques to enhance these vibes the sinister locations with at times claustrophobic vibes blend in splendidly the fact that most parts of the film take place at night or during rainfall completes the perfect picture here the movie features several intriguing characters portrayed by convincing actresses and actors robert pattinson convinces as more emotional fragile and haunted superhero who is easy to sympathize and even empathize with jeffrey wright convinces as gritty honest and loyal lieutenant james gordon zoë kravitz is introduced very interestingly as clever mysterious and passionate selina kyle who is looking for missing friend this film features several impressive special effects this includes car chases hand to hand combats and explosive shootouts these elements are not overused to give the movie dystopian but realistic vibe it refreshing to not see the titular hero flying around and using his supernatural capacities all the time however the movie certainly isn without its flaws first of all the batman is little bit too long and features some minor lengths in the opening third as the different characters are introduced the same could be said about the closing scenes that desperately try to set the table for upcoming prequels reboots and sequels some character development is shallow and lacks realism the connection between batman and catwoman for instance evolves much too quickly and their reciprocal romantic feelings seem to be pulled out of thin air that element also doesn add anything to this movie the same could be said about the development of the antagonist he turns out to be an unstable psychopath without credible agenda who nevertheless goes to extreme lengths to cause harm the addition of the joker who appears out of nowhere in the movie conclusion is disappointing as that character has been overused in the franchise while other interesting ones have barely been exploited another element that needs to be pointed out negatively is the story it isn plain bad but certainly not brilliant either it overall very predictable exchangeable and by the numbers that lack of quality decreases the intensity and tension of the movie instead of ending on high note with satisfactory closure the conclusion of the movie tries to cram as many elements hinting at possible sequel into this movie as possible as you can read the batman is an atmospheric and entertaining fantasy blockbuster with great actresses and actors and strong dystopian but realistic vibe however the film fails to walk off the beaten path as it features several lengths is based upon weak main plot and includes too many predictable and unnecessary references at the end of the day the batman is very good film for genre fans but occasional fans or possible newcomers should rather start their discovery of this franchise with the dark knight or even joker0.0\tthis is not the worst movie have seen this year it is not even the worst movie have seen this week but oh boy is this boring they try to make artsy dark batman with gloomy feel deeply relying on acting and music to save scenes and ultimately the movie they failed this should have been good fit it was raining before headed into the movie theatre was bit buzzed from few single malt also went into this movie with very very low expectations so the tone and attempt at this somewhat depressing batman should have worked perfectly well it didn so what is wrong with this well first of all this does not feel like superhero movie this is moody robert fighting some criminals dressed up as batman in generic dark action movie as such that is not necessarily bad thing and will give them point for at least trying something new with the character the problem is that batman is inherently dark both literarily and as character to make him even darker moodier more goth with no real happy ending and lots of people dying just make the audience feel like you overdoing it it is like putting 10 slices of cheese on your burger at some point it stop being burger and instead becomes pile of cheese secondly several of the actors are horribly miscast zoë kravitz which was my main concern beforehand is actually better than thought she and robert pattinson are both pretty good and mostly do great job the problem is that neither one of them should be playing the character they are playing robert would have been perfect to play the riddler for example and zoë should not have been in this movie they are good but not in their respective character and the same can be said for almost everyone andy serkis whom love is great as always but why was he cast to play alfred over and over character after character is miscast as said they all do good job acting but they are playing the wrong character and it shows thirdly the dark tone coupled with over the top bombastic music with several miscasts while they are trying to make things in lack of better word be more realistic almost come off as comedy there was so many times in this movie was thinking that this should have laugh track and ba dum tss and would not even raise an eyebrow because it would make sense worst though is how boring this is was so so bored cannot remember the last time was this bored at the cinema sure this has some action but things move so slow pacing is way off and always felt like they try to convey some artsy gloomy batman instead of moving the plot forward this does not have to be agonisingly hours and 45min long because boy do you feel it so so boring the good thing is that they tried something new plus points for that and the story is not bad besides some unnecessary family side quest this has decent story and as mention above the acting is good just wrong actors in the wrong roles they also have few cool scenes which unless you fall asleep from bordom before they happen you will really enjoy give this 10 but at least points is deducted for how boring and long this movie is if you can stand the dark tone and slow moving plot lines while robert dress up as batman well then you might enjoy this for me though am never watching this again unless want to fall asleep0.0\tjust going to ask where does the score come from is this supposed to be one the best movies ever what joke boring just boring bad pg action scenes bad score save nirvana bad casting oh the score it was plainly annoying and constantly spoiling the scene like bad horror movie nothing or nobody relatable or worth remembering and believe me was trying so hard to like it gonna store it in my long term memory to never go back to it0.0\twords cannot begin to express the last hours of my life wasted them is an understatement the only reason watched this whole movie was coz paid good money in cinema to watch the batman if it were movie made for teenagers and presented itself as such wouldn mind it but the audacity to pretend that this is serious dark movie and then getting 85 on rt on imdb must ve seen the wrong semi comical so bad it terrible version please don water your time money effort to watch this pile of movie watch literally anything else instead the terrible car chase to call it cliche would be insulting all decent cliches in other films the emo batman look mean thought pattinson had left twilight behind him with movies like lighthouse and good time get it he needs to make some big bucks and doing superhero movie is good way to go about it but mon but all this side just can get over the fact that it getting good even great reviews from audiences and critics alike are we so out of good movies to watch that garbage like this shot by good director of photography is getting rave reviews1.0\tliked the movie there were some ridiculous scenes in the movie but overall liked the movie watched the movie in baku azerbaijan 28 mall cinema plus and the movie theater was good there was no problem on screen light and sound the movie was long it could have been little short because the endings of the movie were bit boring music and specially the main score was good the acting was great robert pattison zoe kravitz paul dano colin farrell jeffrey wright john turturo all did well was happy when heard that robert pattion will be the batman because he is such good actor please forget about the vampire thing matt reeves did great job gotham city was great bruce wayne turned out to be exactly what wanted really liked this movie did not like alfred in my opinion best batman not best bruce wayne not best batman movie but overall very good movie0.0\tsaw the movie today its not the best but can say its good crime thriller movie from superhero batman perspective its not in the mark of animated batman series its quite in the group of movies like zodiac joker silence of the lambs etc but not compact dc batman superhero movie which we the dc comic fans waited for so long and the movie does not have any scope on getting included in future jl movies that pretty disappointing to think from batman movie point of view all the characters performance is appreciable but as dc comics lover expected perfect batman film with origins of other superheroes in development in its universe the other backdrops are movie is quite long and slow which is not appreciable from batman movie perspective we can compare this batman movie with christopher nolan batman movies as thos movies overcame the slowness in between each scene and movie moments wb drastically failed on these parts in this movie after so many dramas over getting superhero movie reboot1.0\tloved this movie thought this was thrilling and entertaining tribute to batman and the characters surrounding the franchise each actor gives wonderful performance zoe kravitz in my opinion gave the best performance for catwoman in my opinion her dynamic with robert pattinson was great and the way she carried herself felt organic compared to lets say halle berry or anne hathaway colin farrell was perfect for the penguin was sceptical when first heard about the casting but honestly really surprised me he and batman had the most exciting scene in the film in my opinion as well serkis wright and others thought the cast was great of course robert pattinson nailed batman the way he carried the caped crusader character was perfect and he really felt like threat however my first issue comes from the other side of robert pattinsons role as bruce wayne feel like when you do superhero on screen with secret identity you should attempt to do 50 50 with the hero and the man behind the mask this movie felt like 90 batman and 10 bruce wayne love batman but was reallu hoping to see new side and personality to bruce wayne that we haven seen before it felt like we barely saw him christian bale gave great performance as bruce wayne although pattinson was still good in the role he left lot to be desired also felt the riddler was somewhat disappointing and think he could have been way better if they lessened the storyline revolving around carmine falcone and just stuck with the penguin if they wanted to do mob stuff the entire second hour just felt like it barely had anything to do with the riddler and they just took too much time focusing on falcone overall great batman movie just needed to work on the ratio of their characters0.0\thave ever seen hands down my friends and kept making fun of how bad the movie was and updating each other how many hours it had until it was over we started the updating with hours left1.0\tthe batman will go down as one of the best comicbook films in long time the script performances set pieces visual storytelling was phenomenal robert pattinson shines as an emotional brooding batman next to paul dano terrifying riddler and menacing collin ferell penguin matt reeves modern masterpiece1.0\tand came through with great performances this is in my opinion the most comic accurate version of batman it slow burn but has some great action sequences and the dark and stormy gotham city backdrop is well done enjoyed this dc entry0.0\twas really hyped for this film but halfway in and wanted to leave its boring there is no character development for one single character they may have established these characters in the comics or dc but didn care or wasn made to care about any in this film the acting is okay except zoe im pretty sure she was cast for one reason thought this would be dark but batman didn seem much different from others and the riddler was laughably non threatening the only redeeming thing was the music it was awesome1.0\tthis film did exceptionally well on showing bruce emotional side partly because of the amazing acting by pattinson and had some good character arcs we all know that bruce has sort of relationship with catwoman but for me the relationship between gordon and batman stood out the most the riddler is shown as dark figure and is executed well with dani eerie unsettling performance is it better than the dark knight it is around about the same level but for some it could be better or worse0.0\tyour life will be wasted on this boring movie that is heavily edited with background music throughout almost the entire show it should be called batman musical instead tbh they rely heavily on the music to create emotion instead of clever script and awesome acting which clearly is lacking the outfit has better plot and proper acting than this garbage1.0\tthe best batman origin story that being captured on live action batman fans probably gonna still pick nolan batman over this version but can definitely say this type of batman is really look like vengeance wb are being really bold and serious about this new batman and they really did it0.0\t2h56m ugh another movie that thinks it an epic news alert the batman ain an epic it just too long another thing this movie isn entertainment fit for an adult mind how many more batboy movies are there going to be the comics were written for pre teen boys so why has this childish myth held on so long nothing new has been added to the story of batboy and sorry folks calling it the batman adds nothing new so much of the film is shot in the dark that estimate that about forty percent of the color in the movie is black meaning you can see much see this so much in films these days and just don get it if you aren comfortable with images maybe these directors would be happier working in radio there are also scenes in which we are looking through windows and can really see very well don get it it like they used camera from about 1910 the violence is completely ridiculous starting from the first scene in the subway there is no explanation for the group of thugs ganging up on the guy leaving the train batboy shows up and beats them senseless although not completely sure because it was too dark to see much you can even see what his car looks like despite the fact that there is five minute car chase scene in which fat guy in normal car evades batboy for most of it one of the worst car chase scenes in movie history even though it probably cost more to film than the entire budgets of most movies made last year1.0\tthis year would mark the 14th year since the dark knight came out after the dark knight made milestone superhero film another batman movie has come out that takes the top place along with the dark knight to be the best of the genre not only that but the batman also transcends the genre following joker and is pure neo noir rather than just superhero movie this was one of the finest films was fortunate enough to experience in the cinemas one of the first things that impressed me from the beginning was the soundtrack and specifically how it is used michael giacchino has created deeply moving sometimes pressure inducing and other times adrenaline rushing soundtrack and the use and integration of the something in the way song by nirvana just makes it all the more atmospheric the first time we are introduced to batman through the narration of his journal it set the tone of the film as well as the confusion and rage of the character when he says vengeance we believe it and that perfectly starts the character arc gotham city is as much character for batman stories as the titular character himself tim burton movies showed gotham that is gothic and little bit crazy nolan tried bit of something in batman begins but decided to play it like any normal city in the dark knight here matt reeves gives life to gotham as the crime ridden cesspool it is where criminals grow like mushrooms after rain the production design by james chinlund and cinematography by greig fraser were on point to make sure the viewers feel immersed in that beautiful cesspool the way the characters are created and explored the city and how everything surrounding it exists feels much more realistic and comic book like at the same time compared to the nolan movies the bat suit looks like something custom made but in secret by reclusive billionaire not like the factory model that is most of the suits yet and the way the suit performs is also the best yet even when in the previous movies people called batman crazy and freak he always looked like superhero but here the suit is perfect to call him the freak who dresses as bat nonetheless looking badass during the fights even the actual suit that is used for the shoot is the most manoeuvrable batman suit among all the films the same with the batmobile it is not future tech armoured vehicle nor bat themed supercar for fun it looks like muscle car and comes with enough modifications so that it works the best way batman needs it to being neo noir exploring the detective side of batman the movie doesn overindulge in action sequences but when it does it delivers easily some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in superhero films and even outside them these were solid they were just enough to satisfy the audience and make them want more in the next part these few aspects like the hand to hand fight sequences the story and the characters being very personal and effective which were missing in the nolan films great as they were robert pattinson has proved himself to be great batman who is still learning the ropes which includes not yet learning to be bruce wayne zoe kravitz selina kyle was the badass heroine wished anne hathway could have been the chemistry between the bat and the cat was the best have seen for couple in superhero film still feel like in gotham hours after came out of the theatre the dark knight might still be the best superhero movie but this one is close second0.0\tmaybe love nolan masterpiece universe too much but to me the batman is out of 10 at best wanted to like this really like pattinson in other movies and the trailer at least gave hint that it might not suck first of all the movie sucked even if you ignore the casting decisions that went against 50 years of comic book lore the fighting sucked cat woman was annoying music was uninspired the story was all over the place and too crammed the acting went from average to cringe writing was lazy and unoriginal and they didn make you care about any of the characters actually amazed at just how bad it was what shame0.0\tdc has truly outdone themselves in being terribad they were already king this movie is complete cliche in wokeness and stupidity there literally no point batman solves nothing at all as batman is truly just white privileged dummy throughout fitting pattinson gets the part there is no redeeming quality here with the exception of colin farrell the movie looks great but fails on nearly every other aspect if you hate batman you will love this movie plenty to hate0.0\tlove the gritty dark movies and for the first would give this movie solid farrell is brilliant actor but the last third was just not very good minus points makes and of course the usual obligatory casual racism about white people white privilege line but that hollywood these days minus two makes1.0\tafter fortunately being able to watch this film at an early screening the enormous amount of anticipation had for this film was fulfilled from beginning to end providing deep character introspections that delve into the psyche of each character proves not only to be respectful but fresh despite the number of interpretations that have been previously portrayed passion is present through each frame of the camera creating horrific melancholic and meditative look at the scenery and the actors portraying their characters it gives the film an emotional angle that is not just spoken through words but the powerful nature of brilliant combination of director and actor the cast is beyond amazing through their interpretations of their characters delivering dialogue in poignant way while also being able to convey emotions speechlessly this film has the feeling of love letter to the characters it portrays on screen crafting story that accurately represents how they are portrayed in the comics while simultaneously delivering on an invigorative and artistic flavor that has never truly been explored in batman movie words cannot fully emote the amount of love and respect have for this film it had exceeded my high expectations by delivering an artistic and true cinema experience that very few can truly accomplish1.0\tnew one man vigilante takes the street it well past twilight and known villains feel the heat cat begins to purr penguin king begins to stir as the curtain rod like rain defines the beat suffocating suspenseful overflowing and sublime1.0\tthis is batman just have seen it and wow the expectations were high as love matt reeves vision when it comes to storytelling and directing if you love more grounded movie and seven and zodiac you will love this honourable mentions collin farrell and paul deno were amazing pattison is without doubt the best batman and bruce wayne inspired by the long halloween rating 10 10 for now1.0\tthis version of batman is definitely darker and grittier than most ve seen pattinson nails this and he seems more aggressive than his predecessors aside from the fact he is trying to catch criminal could argue the approach of batman vs the villains isn all that different he sold really well this more secretive introvert version of the dark knight for someone who has seen him in films across the years his tone voice as batman is truly impressive but as far as the film is concerned this coming from someone who is not marvel fan think it could be shorter although much more noir mystery than an action move it still counts 10min car chase sequence which visually didn do much for me unlike other magnificent shots in the film the other thing that put me off is the romantic aspect to it seemed incredible cliche and quite forced doubt most viewers get emotionally involved in batman and catwoman relationship at all that being said it terrific film to watch in the cinema soundtrack choice is flawless and very involving but more geared towards noir detective fans than proper superhero action flicks1.0\tthis one took me little while to get my thoughts clear on it this movie more than most feels like balancing act there are things about this that loved but then there are things hated to counter them the good this may be the best batman in movie yet loved the way they had him interacting with the police the way they had him actually showing detective skills and working out problems and solving puzzles the gear he uses the suit it all felt within that realm of believable without being cartoon there are moments when the cinematography is just stunning as is the sound design serkis continues to prove he may be one of the more underrated people in hollywood lastly gotham felt like its own city mythical place where things are constantly one degree away from being the purge the not so good while the cinematography is sometimes amazing there are other times when things were so dark it was hard to keep track of what was going on the movies is long really long and it felt like some things could be cut out hate to say it but feel like catwoman could ve been given significantly less screen time or removed entirely and it wouldn have harmed the film all that much while think this may be one of the best batman performances pats as bruce wayne wasn really doing it for me he kept reminding me of the penguin in gotham or johnny depp in dark shadows the bad hated the villain here get what they re going for but everything about him just annoyed me and rubbed me the wrong way don know the comics well enough to recognize if this is some iteration of the character some popular version just not familiar with but wow did not like single moment of them on screen this leads invariably to the ending they took swing appreciate that they did but it just landed with thud for me referring to the climactic finish as well as some of the final shots that just screamed of basic film making at the end though despite feeling very torn as walked out of the theater had the realization that would love to see this batman again different villain different story but if pattinson wants to don the cape and cowl again in that seems like the sign of potential that there is enough here to cling to and that what ll do0.0\tif you are going to remake classic then you should try to do decent job the writing was mediocre and the acting abysmal guess it is better than hacking lung from covid but not by much surly most of the rating is simply because people are glad to be out of the house they can really like this crap most movies and tv shows these days are horridly bad and this one fits in perfectly more hollycrap0.0\tbut if you ve seen one action film ie bond mib film john wick or those racing ones fast and the furious or see cop movie ie the ones where they go in blowing up some drug den you ve seen them all entertaining evening but nothing to note worthy as everyone says emo kid batman instead of stoic brooder stone wall batman or gruff cancer throat batman tumor movie kick ass blob of fat as riddler in some sort of bomb suit instead of the demented psychopathic genius even on gotham series instead we get this garret looking community series mark chapman john lennon shooter fat blob cry baby school shooter looking yoyo film noir or neo noir where the hero in this case batman mumbles incoherently to himself while journaling detective notes or case notes recording his tranformative thoughts in the project honestly think this is going to be the last incarnation of batman after the other multiple reboots it as if they re not even trying anymore as stated you seen one batman movie you ve seen them all loved the architecture and the interior now that classic gothic art the archways the downward melted wax stone work of the coloums very 1930 classic gothic art but yeah just emo batman sulking like emo spiderman batman is supposed to be stoic and brooding but not cry baby brooding0.0\t10 stars for robert pattinson stars for the whole thing the movie is incredibly boring and there no special hero elements guy that decides to save people in distress is just that what was the point of batman suit vigilante why do they make these comic book characters so realistic the entire charm fantasy is the character and the special things it has not normal guy with personal drama like the rest of million cop tv series expected the batman his tech his genius his amazing fighting choreography there is nothing special about him in this movie beside his emo face1.0\tthis may be batman movie but you can see that it was very much influenced by se7en 1995 and zodiac 2007 both where directed by david fincher admire the way this batman attempts to be different in way trying to feel less like comic book and instead of feeling like detective thriller robert pattinson was great has batman playing it has less gruff version of christian bales batman zoe kravitz makes great catwoman playing more to her then what you think the main villain the riddler brings creepy vibe to it that keeps you on the edge of your seat if you are dc fan give this movie look0.0\tbig disappointment bad fighting moves and the story is just bad milky boy is playing batman far away from being superhero imo same story as all of the previous batman movies0.0\twhy does everything have to be anti white woke garbage why would you want to help white privileged city who doesn care about you what why none of the characters match their profiles or typical storylines all the white people are considered to be bad figures who intentions are either unknown or sinister there almost no creativity in the design of the plot nor the development of the characters this was disgrace frankly1.0\twill be short watched many long movies and in some cases time passed by in an instant this movie just felt long colin farrell was awesome batman liked batman and like catwoman as bruce wayne he didnt convince me sory wrong actor for this part selina kyle was much better choice1.0\tthis version of batman is somehow better than nolan version of batman because in dark knight joker stole the show but in this film batman stole the show0.0\tbefore harp on few things here read few dozen reviews both positive and negative just to see where the world was sitting get it covid has given us close to nothing to look forward to and when you watch almost everything on netflix we are dying for something fresh with that being said have to imagine that anyone who watched this hour car crash and gave it raving review either worked on the movie worked for the production companies or has friend family or other who did have something to do with this movie this movie is terrible went into it with zero expectations and it still managed to fall face flat now will give it some wiggle room if your person who lived under rock and has never had the pleasure of watching batman movies michael keaton val killer george clooney christian bale or even ben affleck also never picked up comic book or even watched animated series then maybe this gets out of 10 hours watching emo batman and we still couldn explain anything at all played unnecessary music while having to assume key conversations if your batman fan on any level have decent to little knowledge about batman please watch with caution don operate heavy machinery paul dano was the best thing out of this horrid of film1.0\tbetween this movie and the joker both of which are likely to get sequels it finally feels like dc movies have gone back to their roots gritty dark adult grounded in the real world won spoil any of it but forget about what you ve heard or your preconceptions this is 100 true to the comics and if you are fan of gotham stories you are in for treat0.0\tstars because it wasn paul blart actually might have enjoyed that more nodded off multiple times during this bleak and nonsensical effort to make serious detective batman movie in extreme meed of an editor and anyone with clue about how to maintain storyline change the pace occasionally and create even single character the viewer can give damn about somehow despite the inability to do any of the above they felt their film deserving of nearly hours of viewers time millions to make movie and the batman franchise according to reviews here you think people actually like it maybe some do but our entire theater was not exactly buzzing with enthusiasm during and after this relentlessly dark and boring film the mysteries don even make sense and are just uncinematic crossword puzzles that get solved before you re even interested in them the villain once they pick one actually they never do the focus just keeps drunkenly stumbling from one half baked storyline to another the villains are all boring the only interesting villain is the one that has about one line and we never see because the director ruins everything they actually put in screen have no idea what anyone sees in this every scene the screen is about 90 black and eventually your eyes wear out from exhaustion of seeing the same plodding plot in the same absence of color with the same unlikable protagonist not sure if this was actually movie or an attempt to spread mental disorders in the populace but will count myself lucky if just remember not to go to any sequel to this0.0\tthe batman is as bad as the schumacher movies except instead of being too silly and camp it takes itself way to seriously so much so that it becomes camp it almost as if the film makers were having giggle at 15 year old edge lords who as henry rollins once put it write black poetry in black rooms using black ink on black paper because they are so damn moody add to edgey atmosphere an unneeded 3hr runtime to tell watered down no pun intended version of hush meets se7en and you ll probably find yourself struggling to stay awake the thing is love batman as character just so so tired of the teen angst version of him if want that ll watch the crow at least that shorter and has cool soundtrack1.0\teverything you expected from the batman franchise this movie delivered dc delivered matt reeves delivered from the first second of the first act to until the credits roll my eyes could not be moved from the screen it is so compelling and gripping you are fully immersed in the first minutes three hours passed in what felt like one there are excellent lighting controls excellent cinematography excellent direction and some really good shots the gloomy gritty dark tone of this film is exactly what wanted but got that and so much more the first act is absolutely incredible batman voiceover in the initial and final scenes of the movie is extremely effective robert pattinson is fantastic and he absolutely lives up to his predecessors catwoman is surprisingly well played and even extended dialogue scenes have chilling undertone that just cannot be side lined also michael giacchino is so good the score is absolutely spotless and overwhelmingly effective definitely watching it again and if you haven seen it yet now the time as this is hands down one of the best movies dc has made in long time1.0\tthe sketching of the character of the batman is refreshing the storyline is interesting and some action scenes are worthy of being watched on the imax till the first half it had my attention and the crowd was going all ooh and woah however second half was slow and draggy too many dialogues and that too unremarkable ones finally all leading to the climax where in expected grand showdown or twist but it all turned out to be fizzled out nonsensical cliche fight if you are batman fan you will definitely enjoy it but expect slow motioned grim batman with no thrills what about bruce wayne oh was he in the movie0.0\tthe movie has received top and dire reviews so went to see the movie and make up my own mind this movie tries to capture many cinematic and atmospheric moments but totally fail short first it hours way overrun of very slow takes not much actions and extremely slow conversations like everyone in gotham talks that slow secondly when it comes to actions it not that breathtaking finally it tries to force some political views which it ruins it stay focus on entertaining viewers also got feeling matt reeves is trying to mimic the joker movie due to it tremendous success which is not really an action movie but focus on character development and how society evolved have changed him which is very refreshing approach matt reeves tries to do similar on batman character as well as with the riddler catwoman and other bad guys which is just far too confusing to me1.0\tthere lot to like about this movie paul dano as the riddler who is popping straight out of reddit for instance gold also like batman back into his detective role and introspective on if he is what gotham needs but these seem to be side notes as the director is more focused on creating seven type movie the bloated run time of three hours is really not needed if this was cut down to two hours or we got more time to develop the character and themes this movie could have gone from good to great there are also tonal inconsistencies as many users have noted as some of the dialogue begins to feel campy and over the top really appreciate the story and characters and would have liked those elements to lead the film overall think this batman series has some great potential0.0\tunfortunately the movie was an absolute disappointment half way through just wanted to get up and leave the movie dragged and omg the same batman triller background music was over played not getting started with the batmobile smh in my opinion this batman by far is the weakest batman movie title should be twilight of batman everything was afraid would happen in the movie since thriller release it happened not fan of were it heading0.0\tglad didn pay to see this movie as caught it streaming on hbo max wasn bothered by the violence in the beginning but as the film progressed it made little sense the most glaring mistake was pattinson as bruce wayne ok when he was batman but why would billionaire have greasy long hair covering his face made him look like derelict the overlong movie had ridiculous ending and it obvious they re planning sequel with two villians gonna skip it next time can understand why my friends loved it0.0\tmovie should be 30 to long fight scenes from 80 class movies like american ninja not seenno blood that crazy borning movie for plus pinguin nice role1.0\tvery long film but it was nice to see it the best batman films for me are the christopher nola film with christian bale but this film was good the story is not totally easy to understand but it good in this film batman it also very good detective that helps the police of gotham nice film0.0\tno character or story this was too loud the characters were very superficial with no death and it didn make any sense the whole story was repeating story from the past with nothing innovative nothing new nothing exciting it was extremely loud the cinema we were in was so loud that when we left we had tinnitus in our ears very poor lee written character development0.0\teach shot is work of art but the whole thing is an interminable turnip this batman is neither more nor less twilight than the previous ones it is their decal in story that does not stop being endless because it is constantly restarted to produce nothing more than the previous one0.0\tim not sure who dc paid off to get an stars on here but this movie was awful boring slow wayyy too long it couldnt end fast enough was fighting to stay awake its was more of 3hr crime drama tv series than comic movie little action little dialog long drawn out heart to heart talks just terrible0.0\teverything except for the set design and cinematography was let down for me in this film the script was often laughable the characters had no perceivable arch or revelations the plot was delivered and constantly hinged on dialogue and supposition first rule of film school show don tell it felt like the original script had been for five hour film that had to be cut down with over explained plot points to allow for wider younger audience to follow it was so ready to love all the characters played by such an excellent cast however catwoman felt weak with nothing original in her character are we still putting female superheros in heels and batman just never felt like he had his moment we also never had any costume or gadget car bike reveal moments to indulge in we never saw him suit up or transform we were never really introduced to bruce wayne and his public image it felt like we were given moments where we were supposed to think wow he so complicated but there was nothing to really support these moments other than him delivering few too many punches to someone face though the violence of this was skirted over so it very literally lacked any punch there was one scene that tried to create sense of his vulnerability but it came so late in the film and was essentially another spoon fed plot explaination no it wasn him it was him that any sort of character depth was again lost another issue was the overbearing and continuous score plenty of films use an undertone of music to continually create and build tension but this was just over the top and turned up to 10 the whole time in hour long film the magic wears off pretty quick and you end up picking faults rather than getting lost in the story it meant that by the 100th plot reveal conversation with screaming music on it didn really care anymore especially the final confrontation when batman and villian meet so over it without wanting to spoil too much it also felt tiresome to have another superhero movie that relied heavily on some form of social media platform to tell us story watching paul dano in gimpish mask that covers his entire face he literally one of the best actors around and we barely get to enjoy it delivering threats through fake twitter stream is just not exciting and or scary what we did enjoy was the art direction the sets felt incredibly rich and full of detail we wanted to see more more of bruce waynes home more workshop the lighting was also superb it felt darkly cinematic and the rain made it feel very chlostrophobic there were moments that felt original and innovative however they were often ruined little by the violent scenes which felt over choreographed or just skimmed over another reason why it felt the film had been lowered for younger audience and because the music was always so intense you were kind of expecting to see something gruesome or horrifying but it never came hope we see another film with the same cast in lead roles as despite all that is mentioned above rp definitely suits this role and with better story the whole look and character design would be awesome also more catwoman but make her cooler plz overall visually rich well made film with all the components for success making its simplified delivery and lack of depth all the more disappointing1.0\tgritty noir crime mystery which manages to stand on its own matt reeves found balance between great technical skills and crafty storytelling in the long run pattinson was finest choice to define vengeance and justice with gotham city every other characters1.0\tthe return of not only the dark knight but also the world greatest defective the batman leans more towards psychological thriller than sci fi movie and it really pays off the storyline is so interesting that it didn even bothered me it was 3h movie and tbh it didn even felt that long it was visual wonderful cinematic experience with amazing stunts and great acting on top of it and that all with strong musical theme in the background my exceptions were high and they didn disappoint curious about the future of this so called batverse and truly hope you ll enjoy it as much as did1.0\tactually grew up with the batman it was television series at one point bit standardized but for child interesting then years later we got slew of batman movies with different stars personally prefer christian bale because just think he phenomenal but they all did their part will venture guess yet now we come to this one deviation absolutely but was still missing is plot you have fabulous actors in this and they do their thing but there is no connectivity actually fell asleep few times during the three hours it just didn hold me maybe it generational thing just don need or want action like stories whether they re dramas love stories whatever like stories this was not story0.0\tfan of the series robert pattinson is not so great in his role of bruce wayne mediocre acting lacks charisma great cinematography good plot with its twists and turns interesting take on bat mobile and the bat now prefers the bike0.0\treally bad movie so many face palming scenes don waste your time or money nothing was added or taken away me and my mate was falling asleep the action scenes were cool but everything else was the worst0.0\tthis movie was almost hours was waiting for it to start for of those three hours what mess this was this wasn batman more like guy dressed up like batman terrible just terrible0.0\tlet me tell you the joker gotham tv show were epic for new eras this movie from catwoman penguin to riddler was just freakin horrible christopher nolan all the way this batman was all over the place and his batman voice was blah barely any action and not one memorable scene0.0\tthat hours of my life never getting back realized few minutes in that it would be painful watch because couldn wait for it to be over and was correct robert pattinson is skilled actor but he simply does not have what it takes to be batman this film was even more painful to watch than emo peter parker and that saying lot the batman was dull the dialogues were pointless and uninspired the storyline utterly uninteresting didn care about any of the characters or what became of them batman was depressed introvert with bad hygiene charisma presence redeeming qualities if they at least put some gore in this hour snoozefest there might have been something that made me feel anything watching this but alas there was not the most forgettable boring film ve seen in long time0.0\twhat boring long confusing movie it has almost nothing more than its trailer director tried to make new movie in gotham movie does not even have an extra second it was breathtaking but this batman was like sleeping pill tried very hard not to sleep and once my son woke me up even action scenes are not exciting the twist ending is different from the confusion0.0\tlet start with the positives visually this movie is stunning greig fraser is on roll at the moment loved every frame of it with the car chase and the hall way elevator scene as highlights unfortunately you also need good story and the right actors to make good film loved pattinson as batman but not as bruce wayne the movie is way too long too dark and could easily be hour shorter also what up with all those sped up motorcycle scenes1.0\tcan truly say that ve never experienced this yet campaign of millennial non sense that already insists this is the best batman movie ever made and if you give it any less than an 10 you ll receive not helpful click under the review you probably put lot of thought into yes the millennials have woken this movie isn bad it plenty dark mood wise and stylistically much more like the dc comics it kinda reminds me of dredd in that sense which was good but not great however much better than the stallone flick the difference is that movie was rated the batman is not so we ll still have to wait to see what ve longed for all my life rated batman film have major issues with cast choices for main actors in the case of robert pattinson knew it wasn going to work for whatever reason they thought brit would be good choice but it really wasn it not that don like him really liked the lighthouse role he was strangely suited for and paul dano was not good choice either could think of 10 actors off the top of my head who would ve been much better he got that quirky bizzare cleverness needed for the role but not big fan of his and don get me started about zoe kravitz overall this film was completely unnecessary but at least they didn just re do the same old batman vs joker we ve seen several times action special effects are excellent and big reason didn score it lower0.0\tthe message of this movie is that the real enemy is privileged people not the misunderstood criminals and batman can never solve anything fighting crime because he is part of the problem being privileged himself he needs to reinvent himself like the producers did by re imagining catwoman the mayor of gotham and commissioner gordon certain people are clearly the good guys while those of privilege including batman are part of the problem and need to be lectured to oh how this franchise has fallen0.0\tit clear the director hated batman batman hated batman the movie hated batman this is an example of the woke left ruining an america tradition every white character was bad and every black character was good that fine no big deal but clearly intentional and contrived batman really was worthless in this movie the core theme of this movie was the antithesis of what batman is supposed to be about the film is saying crime fighting does work and is worthless save your 150.0\tthis is the actual headline of prominent 10 star review do these phonies have no shame of course not that was dumb rhetorical question if batman is sooo bad and the people hate him sooo much and if he is sooo self loathing why not just have him off himself get it over with and spare me hours of my life needlessly wasted0.0\tthis movie felt like the director wrote script he was passionate about for another movie then got hired for this and ham fisted all of his favorite details and actors in where they dont belong battinson is fine but gets almost no screentime no character dev whatsoever nothing has any stakes because no character is worth caring about besides the underutilized penguin and falconi if was farrel and put all that makeup on for throwaway role like this while some hack plays the main villain id be genuinely taking look at my life main villain was terrible and the surprise villain at the end was ten times cringier1.0\twhen heard that matt reeves director of dawn of the planet of the apes was making noirish 70s inspired epic three hour batman film was excited to come out of the experience thinking that it was merely pretty good feels like disappointment wasn jonesing for this movie like had been dune but had been really looking forward to it and it pretty good it really needed at least one more rewrite to more properly coalesce its three distinct parts into cohesive whole but even without that was pretty consistently entertained in seven esque sort of way with disaster movie thrown in at the end for good measure it year two of bruce wayne robert pattinson effort to prowl the streets of gotham at night as the menacing batman using his reputation and the light in the sky from lieutenant gordon jeffrey wright of the gotham police department wayne is dedicated wholly to the idea of him being vengeance against the ills of the city that just keep seeming to pile up night after night no matter what he does in this environment zodiac like killer named the riddler paul dano kills first the mayor of the city then the police commissioner and the da leaving hints along the way always directed to batman himself about vast criminal conspiracy hiding in plain sight that the whole city has failed to realize it involves the famous takedown of former drug kingpin in the city that helped make all of their careers leaving carmine falcone john turturro as the main criminal element along with his right hand man the penguin colin farrell the interesting thing about the first two thirds of this film is that it really is just straight up detective mystery batman has to start with the clue left on the mangled body of the mayor to discover particular car of the mayors which has thumb drive which contains incriminating pictures that leads him to the penguin club where he meets selina kyle zoe kravitz who is mainly concerned with missing young woman the former consort of the mayor they team up to continue the investigation using batman tech to get him view into the penguin exclusive club that caters to the most powerful of the city when she ditches batman feeling like she used him as far as she can batman ends up teaming with gordon directly and swear it becomes buddy cop movie it the dark wet it always raining in this gotham city serial killer version of 48 hrs realized during an informal interrogation scene and got tickled mean the scene isn funny well it ends kind of funny but the concept of batman and gordon teaming up for an investigative adventure outside the confines of regulation just kind of made me happy the investigation goes deeper until it becomes obvious that bruce wayne himself is the fourth target of the riddler because his father thomas wayne was somehow connected to this great criminal conspiracy the riddler attack ends up hitting alfred andy serkis bruce lifelong butler and father figure and we suddenly get theme up to this point it just felt like gritty batman adventure going deep into conspiracy to fight the bad guys and then it decides to become movie it really this point where feel like the script needed one more rewrite thomas wayne being implicated in corruption has great effect on bruce so much so that in fact the movie simply stops all other activity for the younger bruce to go into the lion den and meet falcone face to face to hear about his connection to thomas then bruce goes to recovering alfred to hear his side swear had no idea that bruce concept of his father was supposed to be some kind of thematic center of this film until the 90 minute point feel like rewrite would have put bruce concept of his father in the first thirty minutes at most instead of relying it seems on the audience previous knowledge of how other iterations of the batman saga have treated the relationship then the riddler could have made it known his targets early giving bruce time to at the same time investigate those living and dismiss before learning to accept any evidence against his father creating some kind of arc instead at about the halfway point the film stops to shove all this in it not bad it fairly well written it just really concentrated into one roughly fifteen minute long block of film right as we were getting close to the resolution of the big mystery it would have been nice if these revelations could have been better interwoven into the rest of the story now the actual resolution of the mystery comes and it satisfying lot has been swirling around it involving bruce selina and the big secrets of gotham as well and then the movie keeps going for forty minutes acting out like travis bickle from taxi driver would if he had been comic book villain the riddler blows up the seawall protecting gotham and the city becomes flooded driving people to high point where the riddler social media followers have surprise set up this disaster thing get why it comes out of nowhere there real point to it keeping the riddler few steps ahead of batman even after batman physically catches up since the film is told pretty exclusively from batman point of view it makes even more sense however it makes for somewhat odd storytelling as one movie ends and another one in completely different genre no less begins could imagine ways to integrate it earlier the riddler can only blow up part of the seawall because of batman efforts or something but leading to similar results with copycats popping up for seemingly unrelated reasons hints that there more going on so that it doesn quite feel as jarring that being said it spectacle and this movie doesn do spectacle all that often but does it well when it comes it about three quarters brooding investigative mystery but that final quarter is all booms pews and woahs the car chase with the penguin provides some fun twists in that they end up in traffic the disaster movie ending is often quite beautiful to simply look at for all the dark rainy and grimy setting the film is consistently well framed and lit it all the popular low lit to nothing because we re using the best digital cameras and we can get away with it mixed with arthouse focus on weird things in frame but despite the pretensions it does look very good acting is good all around though don think anyone really stands out other than colin farrell completely disappearing behind the makeup of the penguin and paul dano only really revealed late but completely convincing as totally insane person who understands his physical limits pattinson is fine and brooding kravitz is alternatively intense and fragile when the situation calls for it wright is quietly intense as gordon also want to note that its interesting to hear some squeakier male voices like alex fern as the commissioner giving some supporting characters different kind of life to them reeves does the most he can in terms of the production but his script that he co wrote with peter craig comes across as three squished into one instead of one cohesive whole properly foreshadowing the third act might not have been huge lift but the integration of the thomas wayne stuff earlier probably would have demanded much more work as it is though the mystery is the kind of deeply twisting ever changing movie mystery that leaves the audience guessing right along with the characters the character work when it comes it is well considered and the spectacle works it may not be the epic masterpiece had secretly hoped for but it solidly good film nonetheless0.0\tthree tedious boring hours for what amounts to an all too typical top down political scandal it not that the film is bad its made quite well many of the actors are various levels of good enough to phenomenal too trouble is most are not given enough to work with to be memorable especially paul dano who gets one big scene to show his crazy reason behind it is just bit flat although the oscar caliber actor tries hard to make it memorable his role amounts to 90 of him masked yelling into web camera to me this was major let down as one of the best young actors of our time surprisingly felt like jim carrey over the top riddler was more fun to hate here the anonymous killer is less interesting and less enjoyable this is why the batman can both be well made and not good because they ve sacrificed entertainment value for grit as if one can be without the other very heavy modern message about privileged class not being saviors and it replaces kick ass action film with one of lecturing ted talk okay with pushing batman into modern version of hero one which has to talk things out instead of always just fighting but the film presented has to cover that up with some moments of thrills it has few and if it were anything other than batman young people would be bored out of their minds by the morality by group approved consensus it presents it not edgy like batman film should be it safe and purified in dull glaze of preachy morality why can people simply trust the batman just saved them and go on with their day why not because cops are the defacto bad guys right now in the eyes of many in the real world this could make sense in the fantasy world of batman he always stood for the thing that was morally higher because he was so selfless one moment rings especially true when riddler says may have given you too much credit you didn figure it out did you to blank stare from batman that made me laugh out loud that exactly what was thinking this batman is kind of moron compared to the detective skills from bale or keaton never anticipating there could be more to the plan here we have batman who sits and thinks investigates throughout the movie comes up with very little evidence beyond solving riddles quickly which he is great at like always he really doesn do much solving of anything maybe code or two preventing of anything except last minute dive to save the day because you just feel bad for all involved in this story you can really have fun which should be the core of any film like this even the film joker the indie feeling movie with joaquin phoenix as equally somber and twisted as this manages to have moments of sheer glee and celebration of big entertainment joker has some memorable lines too some eye catching camera work here the film is perfectly well done but not at all memorable except for what it lacked you can only call this good compared to ben affleck batman that has been so flat for many years again not the fault of affleck the film is just boring and so is this there are just too many moments was laughing when it was supposed to be serious like the hammed up performance by usual subtle actor paul dano who sings ava maria as batman punches the glass for some reason to half ass get to him sure we could talk about how interesting it is that riddler thinks batman is on the same side but can focus on that until dano stops singing ava maria and batman stops punching the glass with no effort whatsoever what you do in your literal on screen sequences matter most subtext is only important if the audience is first engaged by being entertained penguin is reduced to mobster clichè joke about as bland as can be promising to make his character fleshed out later but what about now in these three hours zoe as catwoman is the most interesting character but barely goes through any change after the initial action and let talk about action hardly any until chase an hour into the film then one major attempt at the end where did they spend 200m here it not on screen the film is constantly talking and taking about doing more talking with dialogue that often is unintentionally funny or cheesy the line where riddler thanks his followers for their tips on explosives like any youtuber thanking people for subscribing got big laugh from me in serious moment the film thematically is of mix between the saw films with grotesque torture hinted at more than seen but equally disturbing worse than much of the torture porn genre of horror of the 00 films like hostel were less disturbing somehow and 90 batman rip off film such as the shadow dick tracy rocketeer or the phantom like those films it assumes by moving slower and being less flashy it is classy smarter not necessarily say instead it takes too long to get to that simple story and doesn have any flash to get you to those moments any easier there are no memorable quotable lines like nicholson in 1989 batman where does he get those fancy toys nor iconic action like in nolan films the semi truck flipping in dark knight is more heart pounding than the entirety of this film it not really an action film too severe for kids film too boring for fantasy film it doesn have the production design of burton films looks good in general way but nothing super special they rightfully got rid of the bat nipples of the schumacher years and went more indie than the action packed nolan films but what left is overly preachy hour film that could have said more in half the time saw sequel spiral had essentially the same plot killer targeting corrupt city officials cops yet was considered horror and low brow while this does much of the same and is considered artsy go figure pattinson does all he can and appreciate the emo vibe and painted eyes finally shown after he demasks but once again there is little room to be unique keaton best added himself into this sometimes bland character since then few have been able nobody does badly it just not special and batman should be an adventure not like this was looking at my watch 60 minutes in thinking it must be about over and realizing it was only 3rd done batmobile is also bit bland not going to sell many of those toys cool they went sort of adult but what about the adults who love cool stuff finally one thing really loved was the score it is very moody memorable snd unique often more so than what is going on behind it1.0\tthe batman was directed by matt reeves who co wrote the screenplay with peter craig reeves also produced the film alongside others this film is reboot of the batman film franchise and is set in separate universe away from the dc extended universe thus giving matt reeves full rein on his batman universe one of the choices he made was to explore batman detective side more than what previous films had done drawing inspiration from 1970s films and comics such as year one the long halloween and ego would say matt reeves succeeded with it making it stand out from other batman films and most importantly making it feel like batman film his interpretation is grounded accurate and overall fantastic for fan of live action and comic book the presence from its inspiration from year one and the long halloween is felt and rightfully so they re some of my favorite batman graphic novels after all and reeves screenplay and story is truly perfect and mesmerizing so is his direction and visual storytelling brilliantly done during the second year of bruce wayne career as batman the riddler sadistic serial killer begins murdering key political figures in gotham batman is forced to investigate the city hidden corruption and question his family involvement robert pattinson plays bruce wayne batman reclusive billionaire who obsessively protects gotham city as masked vigilante to cope with his traumatic past batman is around 30 years old and is not yet an experienced crime fighter as director matt reeves wanted to explore the character before he becomes fully formed which in my opinion was the right choice to do zoë kravitz plays selina kyle catwoman nightclub waitress drug dealer and cat burglar who meets batman while searching for her missing roommate her moral ambiguity challenges batman black and white view of good and evil paul dano plays edward nashton riddler serial killer who targets elite gotham citizens and livestreams his crimes the riddler seeks to unmask the truth about gotham taunting batman and law enforcement with riddles jeffrey wright plays james gordon an ally of batman in the gotham city police department the only gcpd officer who batman trusts they re the leads the supporting cast is too full of well known names like andy serkis as alfred pennyworth john turturro as carmine falcone colin farrell as oswald oz cobblepot penguin and peter sarsgaard as gil colson greig fraser worked as the cinematographer for this project and his beautiful cinematography is felt in every scene together with the director he made cinematic masterpiece with it being one of the best shot superhero movies but there something with this character this mythology and just gotham in general that draws filmmakers and cinematographers to create stunning looking films the batman is among them michael giacchino musical score is well fantastic in lot of ways honestly one of the best musical scores ve ever heard possibly the film wouldn be as good if it weren for giacchino work it incredible the editing is excellent production and art design are brilliant ll say the same to the sets and props it feels like gotham with its gothic style the gargoyles and interiors like the animated show and original batman film or the arkham games the action sequences aren over the top they re too grounded and thus realistic they re also shot extremely nice like the rest of the movie an example of well shot and epic action sequence are the dark corridor and another is the car chase there so many more and matt reeves truly nailed the action in this film the fights seemed so human as this batman is still so new to the violence as here he isn truly the world greatest detective or beacon of hope but something that the criminals fear he vengeance the batman met my expectations and it now regarded as one of the best superhero films ve seen with its perfect cinematography and direction but also how gripping gorgeous and how it the grounded detective story the character deserves matt reeves trusted his instincts with casting robert pattinson as bruce wayne and his interpretation is one of the best ve seen don think another actor would have done such good job with this version of the character robert was indeed the person reeves wrote the character for also want to add how loved zoë kravitz in the role as selina kyle she brought the character straight from the comics and well it brilliant so robert zoë and paul dano bring superb performances that you ll remember for long time but didn expect jeffrey wright would pull this impressive performance as james gordon he truly made special performance strong performance paul dano likened the riddler to the zodiac killer whom he felt was the real life riddler for his practice of communicating with ciphers and riddles it was the right choice his performance is incredible and will be remembered fondly for years to come though colin farrell doesn have lot of screen time he leaves mark and memorable performance as oswald oz cobblepot penguin can wait to see him in the upcoming spin off show and sequel as his performance was extremely memorable and entertaining to watch think this is perfect movie but for long review think need to criticize something and ve read many critics criticizing the length of the movie and don agree with that as feel it needed for an epic noir driven tale about batman second year actually wanted the first and second act to be longer did feel the final thirty minutes or so could have been trimmed little bit and maybe change some of the writing but don want to spoil anything in this review the final act is still great though don get me wrong but there tiny flaw with it matt reeves rebooted batman is movie worth checking out but also worth going back to as there lots of references and easter eggs to be found matt reeves respects the comics and the large mythology surrounding batman and gotham the batman is cinema0.0\tdon know about the star reviews because this is the worst batman of all time we got an emo kid with one skill punches across the face has suite full of gadgets that he doesn use at all at least his suit diverts every bullet into his chest or perhaps they re afraid to shoot his face why is riddler in the owl suit was penguin catwoman necessary this movie should have been titled the riddler why was the riddler trying to be like heath ledgers joker it my 2nd worst cinema experience in row watched matrix4 now this0.0\tfeel like watched different movie from others because found it soooo boring slow moving weak action scenes and lack of chemistry between robert pattinson and zoe kravitz nothing compared to christian bale and anne hathaway this movie was nowhere near the awesome christopher nolan trilogy hardly any character development for batman outside the suit plus the movie was too unnecessarily long1.0\tunlike other batman movies the batman shows us the most important aspect of batman batman detective work as well as combact skills and brutality first 3rd of the movie is absolute masterpiece but it has some minor flows but nevertheless everything about the was great absolutely loved the film0.0\tdo you hate batman and love not so subtle leftist style racism then you will love this movie these leftist elites will never stop trying to ruin everything0.0\tindividually there nothing that necessarily stands out as downright terrible though the score sound design music let just call all that sound from here out comes very very close but even if falls into that category that alone shouldn result in such boring bland movie but here we are the cinematography is fairly good the acting is acceptable the script isn even necessarily bad but everything combined together somehow results in movie that is borderline unwatchable despite its huge budget great visuals costume design strong cast etc you ll likely be able to tell if you re going to like this movie and agree with my review in the first 10 minutes as it almost immediately apparent throughout the first scenes that the director has utterly failed in his endeavor to create dark thrilling movie consider the opening scene of blade runner 2049 vs the batman the sound design immediately sucks you into the blade runner world and the opening scene score and landscape gives sense of the grandiose scope of the movie in the batman the lack of atmosphere is so pronounced you feel as if you re watching post production edit that awaiting final touches from the sound department the batman also somehow managed ruin every great song they included as well compared to how the crow soundtrack was huge factor in creating the dark mood atmosphere of the movie the batman fails and somehow managed take all time great song by nirvana and make it feel completely soulless it so misses the mark that it actually jarring as it so obvious of an attempt to appeal to nostalgia rather than well fitting artistic choice this unintentional emotional vacuum continues throughout the entire movie and is personified by pattinson performance wouldn even call his performance inherently bad his somewhat flat delivery was almost assuredly 100 intentional but the movie making of everyone else esp the director matt reeves is simply not good enough to create the backdrop for such performance to come off correctly this is probably remarkable feat for anyone who seen pattison recent work and has likely been impressed with how natural captivating and charismatic his performances have been under good direction notably the king good time the lighthouse etc and to end with simple summary don know that this movie will be enjoyable for anyone who isn hardcore batman dc fanboy0.0\tso slow so boring and with so many scripts problems that made me almost leave the cinema twice 3rd of the movie is worthless with scenes as the one in the hospital that make you ask why pattinson looks much better with the mask than ben affleck much better but when he takes the mask off he looks like teen ager with need of two slaps on the face and the ridller really really with so many great villians in batman history jack nicholson tom hardy cillian murphy joaquin phoenix lovely margot heath ledger we miss you not even the batmobile is worth the ticket and the motorcycle looks someone realized on set that they needed one and picked one randomly from the parking lot another missed opportunity this movie makes me want to go to the movies to see the darknight1.0\tis this better than the dark knight can be compared to zodiac and se7en liked the added mystery detective type of story compared to other batman films this makes more darker themed batman also amazing score and cinematography1.0\tthis is probably the most intelligent batman script on screen everyone who matters is complex it endeavours to convey something about the character that doesn reek of edgelord or boring moral relativism world building is very smart and rolled out with impactful moments no one is likeable everyone is understandable there couple contrivances that think most would roll with easily given it super hero flick solid performances nothing incredible but certainly solid it takes itself seriously thankfully something super hero films often falter with undermining the story in blade runner 2049 they codify the aesthetic as urban snow trash if remember correctly substitute that was with rain and you ve got something comparable in so far as colour palette story principles the emotional soundscape made me think of early conner oberst little bit emo little bit angry and sad adolescent but valid the hunt for an unpredictable killer tied to nihilistic systemic components is also heavily present overall this was pleasant surprise the cinematography is uneven with high highs and uninteresting lows the pacing is slightly off and feels bit overlong and the penguin feels like the only uninteresting character the predominate drag maybe otherwise though solid stuff no reason not to give it shot imo1.0\tthere was not one bad part of dialoge or footage the tone and speed was perfect how it slowly climbs the cinema photography was probably the best have ever seen besides the movie 1917 acting was insane by everyone in the cast great job robert pual and zoe you guys were great0.0\tso this movie is awesome looking wanted to love it but it falls apart thinking back on it actors like pattinson and kravitz play their roles very well but are given very little time to act and develop the characters the film is more concerned with choppy fragments of stories which are under developed and leaves one with the feeling what the heck did just spend three hours watching real waist of some glimpses of outstanding storytelling0.0\treading all the 10 10 reviews makes me think watched completely different movie love majority of the batman movies and was excited for new take on it but that was such drawn out movie somehow the characters seemed over dramatic but at the same time so dull and there were so many subplots it was easy to miss things and forget characters who pop up later in the film and had to ask my husband who they were talking about and he was also like don know lol was excited to see paul dano spin on the riddler but once he was unmasked it felt like he was just super smart high school kid who was twisted and had bad childhood they should have definitely used some of the prosthetics to enhance collin farrell as penguin who was totally unrecognisable to captivate paul dano as the riddler the whole storyline fell flat the fight scenes were nothing exciting and walked away unsatisfied with the ending also love how batman carries flare gun on him0.0\tin the darkest batman film yet where daylight is seldon seen and robert patinson mubles his dialogue endlessly you can actually fall asleep very easilly the batman follows in the footsteps of the previous two films with its lack of humor and depressing cinematography gone is the over the top comic book version in three hour mess of plot padded with loads off needless dialogue1.0\tthe batman is gripping gorgeous and at times genuinely scary psychological crime thriller that gives bruce wayne the grounded detective story he deserves robert pattinson is great as very broken batman but it zoe kravitz and paul dano who steal the show with movingly layered selina kyle catwoman and terrifyingly unhinged riddler writer director matt reeves managed to make batman movie that entirely different from the others in the live action canon yet surprisingly loyal to gotham lore as whole ultimately it one that thoroughly earns its place in this iconic character legacy0.0\tthis confirms to me to never watch film going only by the imbd rating this was complete waste of hours of my life and waste of my time and money there is hardly any story the acting is poor throughout and robert peston was diabolical he must have been paid millions for an appalling usa accent mumbling and zero acting skills apart from looking and sounding moody and tormented the cinematography is dreadful and as though the backlight had broken on the projector get that they were trying to make it dark but they might have well turned all the lights off on set to please little greta wanted to walk out but would have disturbed others so stayed with the torture as we all ran to the toilets after hours of holding ourselves the talk was very negative hearing the words what drag and boring another load of hype that was taken in by1.0\tone word phenomenal acting 10 10 story 10 10 music 10 10 action 10 10 what else do you want hours of amazement it truly didn disappoint me as massive batman fan but even tho this movie is made for every one it has everything watch it enjoy it then watch it again0.0\tthe movie is just waste of time if you dont believe me go and watch yourself no story no suspense the actors are great but the story is waste0.0\tit tries so hard and it tedious long and boring really don understand those 10 stars given by others pattinson has such an emo role it felt like twilight all over again with over the top feelings which shouldn be there sorry but that my opinion when it comes to this movie at least colin farrell was spot on with his role must say that loved the fact that batman was portrayed more as human being that can get hurt physically rather than the usual superhero with almost superpowers still it missed something dunno what exactly1.0\tthis movie is written and structured so well it truly will have you hooked from start to finish lot of resemblance from nolan dk which didn think was possible1.0\tso much to love and enjoy in this film the style of filming shots angles cinematography plot made this film so unique and not just like another copy and paste superhero film loved how they tested the pg 13 ratings limits to the max and really proved that these kind of gritty dark themed films don always have to be rated the score was incredible added so much power and emotion to many scenes will definitely be playing the soundtrack on my headphones the runtime may be an issue for some viewers but personally loved it it gives us much more time to see more characters in depth and doesn rush the plot some scenes were very intense and made me feel so nervous or scared for something to happen suspense was used perfectly the plot thought was great it finally crime detective themed batman film the themes are dark and nerve racking dialogue is intense cinematography sets the mood perfectly and the characters are written and casted perfectly highly recommend seeing it0.0\tthis movie is complete utter nonsensical garbage my god anyone reading this before seeing the film do anything else with your life for hours walk the dog have picnic play video games write poem anything but waste second of your life on this garbage0.0\tanother mediocre and overrated movie we are accustomed to the fact that the content that arrives is usually boring tedious with hilarious dialogue and predictable characters and situations because producers set certain requirements that writers must adhere to if certain characters and situations are not written as well as certain dialogues the series or film will not be funded that why most movies and shows today are predictable and tedious it rip off many things from daredevil and se7en1.0\talways feel in our ever divisive non nuanced society if something is good it must be 10 or if it disappoints compared to expectations then it must be or both overly high or low score wouldn justify judging this movie in my opinion mamouth batman fan and there is so much good stuff like how they captured gotham perfectly gave us tons of originality the score some great lines and casting but unfortunately the over scripting horrid pacing and laborious length hinders this greatly they really draw things out over many dialogue heavy scenes just to make one clear point it like the anti nolan technique where he makes no wasted motion everything serves purpose thus you are hooked into the stakes and sense of jeapordy this film dragged and couldn wait for it to end which is why torn on it because there is so much good stuff both dialogue and action to enjoy between the monotony and general gloom even in depressing environment you have to diversify your scenary and expression from time to time 10 feels about right to me0.0\tthe audience of this movie should be strictly film school the joker does everything this movie does and successfully adds plot that an audience can relate to the movie is too long the script is very basic and predictable the plot is written by captain obvious himself people comparing it to seven paid actors would have actually enjoyed the movie without these atrociously ridiculous reviews read most of these 10 10 reviews pathetic replica of one another noir detective yadda action yadda an unrefined batman its just sad0.0\tjust got home from seeing the batman honestly don know how feel about this one as walked out had 10 in mind but that may change as think about the movie bit don expect to see the batman that you have come to know in the new movie you are in essence just watching guy wearing mask trying to solve politically and corruption motivated murder the plot could just as well have been in jack reacher or ethan hunt movie the batmobile is suped up corvette there is no bat cave and he spends most of his time on motorcycle his gear is leather mask cape and torso shaped bullet proof vest he rounds the costume off with some combat boots pattinson is truly uninspiring rivalling the worst of seagal performances while the cinematography is great the movie is utterly one trick and monotonous you are literally sitting for hours listening to eery orchestral tunes and looking at pattinson staring into the distance while doing his best impression of an emo teenager there are some strong performances from kravitz farrell and dano but it is not enough to save the overly long movie bring back the batman from the dark night please we need hero0.0\tthis is the worst movie ve seen since the blair witch project thankfully that wasn hours long like this horrible excuse for batman movie the writer director and producers will hopefully never work again terrible musical score horrible acting no plot other than white privilege batmobile looked like junk car and bat cycle was regular motorcycle waste of time and money0.0\tdc has really disappointed this time with the batman remember people being upset about casting robert pattinson but was positive and looking forward to change it not the action but the director and how the movie is made the batman from the very beginning is dull and gloomy was put to sleep already in the first half of the movie the movie only picked up the last 30 mins where it ended movie making is an art where you have to understand that you need to engage your audience the interest has to be maintained from the start so they can see the story you re trying to tell not sure why dc movies are way too dark the riddler was phenomenal but the movie was poorly made only giving two stars for riddler performance which was shown at the end of the movie dc please note to make movies that are fast pace less complicated story wise and take only one villian save your self money and watch this at home1.0\tloved every second of it excellent performances paul dano colin pharrell zoey kravitz and robert pattinson were all fantastic absolutely recommend it to watch especially if you are fan of nolan batman0.0\thow is this film being compared to the dark knight the pacing was awful for hour film the action only happens in the last 40 minutes character development was poor we hardly see bruce batman seems bulletproof the actors selected for the film were off by long shot too highly disappointed1.0\tlet start with what not the best with this movie it very very long it should of been shorter as there was fair bit of stuff that made the movie bloated pattinson was very mopey uncharismatic bruce wayne and alfred did not feel like father figure to bruce oh and there was very cringey line about wealthy white men but it gone in second positives let talk about them kravitz and wright as gordon and selina kyle where absolutely fantastic pattinson was great as batman despite not being great as bruce pattinson gives batman levels farrell as penguin was brilliant you wouldn even know it him as was turturros falcone riddler was very good villain too and had batman questioning everything he believed in batman does more detective work in this film than in any other movie he is clever and thorough the film had the long halloween vibes in moments and definitely some seven vibes too overall this is very good movie albeit bit long1.0\tvery dense dark cold totally devastated dirty criminal city bruce is quite tormented gordon and bruce play detectives investigating all the rottenness of the police politicians and millionaires it very reminiscent of se7en the rider is totally insane and at the end you have to hit people to make them react just like se7en killer impeccable performances edward cullen goes from being stupid vampire to smart bat catwoman does good job falcone is the fearsome crime boss and the penguin is not far behind climbing the rungs bruce parents are not totally clean the final cameo lets you wanting to see what is to come for the saga it is pretty long and slow movie it is not for everyone many will be bored with batman voice off saying his thoughts it is definitely not for children there isn much action but it has its moments so you don get bored with batman unleashed in the end batman is what he should be an altruistic vigilante capable of doing the impossible to save his beloved gotham if they took 20 minutes out of the hours it would probably be better1.0\tfull disclosure huge batman fan would say that the three movies by christopher nolan are probably my three favorite movies of all time and that the three arkham games are probably my three favorite videogames ever so of course was extremely hyped for this movie which also means that there was big chance of me getting disappointed and sadly it was the case hopefully it was just the hype and my review will change after future viewings which think is really possible especially after reading other reviews and seeing how most people loved it but anyway this is my review after watching the film for the first time being big fan of detective thrillers like se7en and prisoners was really on board with the tone and story the batman was going for also liked the idea of dark and realistic batman but with more comic book feel than the bale movies and even when the movie mostly succeeds in the tone thought it failed story wise first the movie tries too hard to develop too many characters and story lines which makes it hard to stay invested on any of them sometimes felt that when was finally getting intrigued by the riddler storyline the movie switched to focus on the penguin or falcone and vice versa in some ways the movie makes the same mistakes spiderman did introducing too many characters and storylines interrupting you from getting griped second even when we spent ton of time with many characters it feels like the movie doesn spend enough with bruce wayne agree with not showing again the same origin story we ve seen too many times but think the movie should stay little more time with bruce wayne letting the audience get more attached to the character so the movie can have bigger emotional impact even when he is dressed as batman sadly even being hour movie the batman doesn seem to spend enough time with its main character in regards of pattison performance thought he was ok but not even close to bale finally in what comes to the ending no spoilers but you can skip this part if you want to have no idea the movie doesn deliver the impactful finale that it seemed it was trying too hard preparing the plot twist we were all waiting on the end never comes and the final battle is just batman taking down some thugs in context that feels bit over the top in conclusion the batman could have been great but sadly it isn the se7en tone the cast and the cinematography got me hopping this would be the new dark knight unfortunately the movie tries to do too much for just one movie never letting you get totally invested and leaving you with an ending that makes the whopping hours feel not seem worth it0.0\tlooks great but slow boring and too long and unfortunately pattinson does not cut the mustard as batman looks like moody vampire from twilight was glad when it was over0.0\tyes you say yes there something very wrong with you for giving it score like that that might be what you re saying and don blame you to be fair excepted to like it even wanted to like it but was bored out of my mind was so bored almost couldn stand it wanted to leave and this reaction surprised me because my brother liked it and we usually have similar taste in movies and when he told me that honestly had an existential moment where was questioning the very nature of my own judgement pointed at myself and said is there something wrong with me shrugs but can explain it it just didn catch me it felt very slow and bland like force eating ice cream with no flavor just didn care and couldn get myself to care even if wanted to now just to be clear not one of those adhd kids who needs things exploding all the time to enjoy movie not thoughtless idiot or child 40 years old so can sit down and enjoy methodical procedurals like david flincher zodiac or seven which this movie seems to take some of its influences from but those movies were infinitely more engaging to me then this movie not trying to persuade anyone of my point of view if you liked it cool glad for you just wish liked it but couldn was to busy waiting for it to be over so could do something else that was lot more fun1.0\tall may think this is hours long movie so it might turn boring but it didn even for minute for me it was picture perfect because dialogues scenes and actions scenes were organized properly it was picture perfect an amazing score amazing cinematography amazing cast zoë kravitz is the best catwoman yet imo batman suit is just brilliant pattinson not great bruce wayne but splendid batman maybe matt reeves will work on that in the sequel the riddler was really good as the whole movie gave batman hush batman the long halloween vibe and loved those animated movies the penguin for the first time in live action looked actually like the character phenomenal job done by the makeup artists good take on carmine falcone as well as gordon last but not least the new batmobile was mind blowing0.0\thave learned to never trust the top reviews on any site especially here am glad did not pay dime for this movie if did would have been really upset is it an ok movie its watchable guess but its drawn out and kind of boring at times and when movie has an score you expect something spectacular and this is far far from it sorry folks movies are not good lately and there are lots of reasons why that cannot get into here 10 another hollywood bore fest1.0\tthe batman by reeves is slow burn dark and more grounded or simple guess compared to dark knight trilogy but has the same grim dark atmosphere the good things the plot is well written it straight forward different and has good progression it an enjoyable ride to see the story unfold there are some cool scenes and visually stunning cinematography the score and sounds in general is great like that they make the batman more physically human the bad things it bit lackluster and there not many action scenes there are some violence but maybe since it pg 13 they need to cut it back and try their best to fit the ratings pattinsons and kravits did good job portrayed their characters but their romance feels forced and unnecessary some of the lines are 2emo4me overall genuinely enjoyed it it crowd pleaser batman films that even hardcore nolan snyder would enjoy though there are some flaws 100.0\tnice photography too long and need the depth nolan brought to each character phillip the joker was masterpiece actors like morgan freeman michael caine and joaquín phoenix are missed1.0\twhen watching this movie felt the sudden urge to end this movie sure the acting writing action and cinematography was good this was unpredictable but it lacked the most crucial thing being interesting that all1.0\tmatt reeves knows how to do batman movie he understands character very well cast was phenomenal paul dano riddler was best and terrifying real threat score of movie was brilliant no negatives saw in it this movie is pure masterpiece 10 10 from me1.0\tno words this film is everything hardcore batman fan will love matt reeves really crafted this film as fan rather than as basic cbm director that is ordered to make film for studio this film has heart and it feels like reeves dream film for how dedicated and passionate he is about this is must watch film so go to your nearest cinema and enjoy this film when it releases ofc1.0\tagree with few reviews that have mentioned this movie is not for everyone ve never been fan of overwhelming amount of action so watching good ol crime film with superb acting is quite refreshing and it pretty cool that it focusing on the crime solving batman has been known to do in the comics the little action in this film was visually pleasing and doesn let the audience lose focus from the plot can tell you how much hate those hour long fighting scenes in marvel movies that have 500 things going on this day in age it all we see so it makes me appreciate this movie even more1.0\tmovie with very good movie stuff that makes movie viewers enjoy movie good but bad guy in movie bad batman is good movie and also just let me write this review thank you1.0\tif you enjoy reading my spoiler free thoughts please follow my blog to read my full review the batman deserves all the hype it generated and then some matt reeves delivers distinctly darker more intense frighteningly realistic noir thriller than past adaptations with an aggressively vengeful bruce wayne batman and fear inducing mysterious lunatic riddler greig fraser cinematography bone chilling ins and outs of batman and stunning footage of gotham and michael giacchino score genuinely addictive elevates the entire film make this adaptation the best looking and best scored cinematic version of the batman ever even with the narrative focus on the detective work the action sequences are exhilarating and beautifully shot the entire cast is extraordinary especially paul dano and robert pattinson the latter destroys all skepticism around his talent apart from short period at the end of the second act the three hours fly by it one of the best movies of the year and fair contender in the debate of best comic book movie of all time rating1.0\ttrue detectie batman movie in my opinion best comic live action movie of all time just wow other hand when saw reviews from some strange people of metacritic and rotten was in shock most of the negative reviews are about how darkness and depressing this film is for duck sake this is film about the batman not frinendly spiderkid fan service movie truly can recommend this film to overyone who likes comics drama detective movie totally goat of all time0.0\tmatt reeves usually delivers but soon as the cast was announced was lost and still am none of them are great mean seriously rating lol it seems the more boring film gets the more the attention everyone loves it despite it been such slow film glad have the burton keaton films they was dark and still with comic book feel don like films that was fun try to be too serious it ruins the whole idea of character didn mind the nolan films but even them easily over blown bale was great but no keaton am actually gutted we didn see afflecks version he wanted gritty film with less cgi man is capable and he looks like the comic book yet they go and change it all and cast patterson mean what patterson after saw you in the lighthouse was willing to give this try but the film is let down ll put you ahead of clooney but that the best we can do1.0\twhat liked thought robert pattinson was great as batman it dark and gritty it noir feel and attempt to stay true to the comics action sequences were awesome cinematography it realism you can tell matt reeves payed attention to what chris nolan did in the dark knight series with minimal cgi and realistic effects what didn like it way to long and drawn out at hours long it needed better storyline to hold up each plot it tries to be complicated and intriguing but feels flat lot of the time alfred has very little to with anything in this batman the noir feel is great but it really needed more action to keep it exciting the riddler he felt overacted and at times it was hard to understand what was being said some characters defiantly felt miscast the ending this movie tried to build and build to an ending that is good but misses the mark overall the movie is good thought robert pattinson was batman the suite looked great and liked the feel of the movie even if it very dark portrayal of the batman universe it wayyyyyy to long given the story line wanted to be excited but just wasn like what matt reeves has done as this is totally different portrayal of batman but it tries to hard in lot of areas and doesn do enough of what makes it stand out good movie but defiantly think it will have its critics1.0\tout of all the batman movies this had hands down the best story great crime drama cinematography was spectacular held true to the grim dark feel of the comic pattinson was great as batman weak as bruce wayne looked and came across like brooding teenager no character was bad but none really stood out even collin as penguin but he was better than most did like the casting of gordon1.0\tmost grounded version of batman ve ever seen put into live action acting is genuinely gripping plot respects it viewers intelligence cinematography is great score is excellent too 10 10 would watch this crime thriller again0.0\tit would appear nobody thought that this film needed editing and as such it is hours long and quite honestly not very good the whole essence of the classic batman type film has been stripped away what you re left with is robert pattinson doing jason statham impression dressed as bat with comedy nose and robert pattinson looking like an older version of that guy in the twilight films whose methadone has run out put simply every time you think it going to end it doesn if you want to spend hours in the cinema don waste them on this awful film0.0\twas so excited for this movie and really gave it chance but it was just awful think it hurt the franchise and my goodness do they need to leave bats alone for while1.0\tthe batman is an action drama movie in which we watch batman trying to protect the citizens of gotham from the riddler sadistic serial killer who murders some politicians of the city have to admit that did not have high expectations from this movie but happily surprised by it it was different than the previous batman movies bit darker and the action scenes were also captured from different aspect the plot of the movie was interesting and contained plenty of suspense but it also contained some very slow scenes that they could be sorter the interpretation of robert pattinson who played as bruce wayne was good and he made the difference some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were zoë kravitz who played as selina kyle jeffrey wright who played as lt james gordon andy serkis who played as alfred and paul dano who played as the riddler finally have to say that the batman is nice action movie and highly recommend everyone to watch it1.0\tfor hours was on the edge of my seat absolutely enthralled by what was watching on screen the layers and interconnectivity to this story are incredible and make it supremely rewarding viewing experience pattinson nails the role and brings some real emotion and vulnerability like we haven seen before from this character his arc in the film feels earned and genuine the depiction of gotham as this grimy seedy world is the best we ve seen yet on film and felt completely transported loved the dark nihilistic tone and the riddler serial killer like persona was captivating just because there aren forced jokes every 10 seconds like in an mcu film doesn mean there isn humor there was plenty of humor it was just dry and more subtle giacchino might have crafted the most perfect batman score ve ever heard cannot get it out of my head the scene where the batmobile revs up was an unforgettable moment in the theater and the subsequent car chase was one of the most intense action scenes ve seen in years the scene with riddler talking to batman about bruce wayne was jaw dropping in its masterful design this film was somehow even more grounded in realism than nolan trilogy was the batman is mix of se7en zodiac and the dark knight that completely delivers on the hype this is the most perfect depiction of batman and his world ve ever seen in the cinema1.0\trobber pattinson just outplayed the character the way batman act the dark effect the detective mode it really amazing to see speechless about catwoman aka zoe kravitz and riddler role was too much op brilliant movie ever made in history1.0\tmean didn understand big parts of the movie because of the language barrier but all in all it wasn that good seen before in the nolan series the riddler was nicely played the rest meh of course it big showy blockbuster so it wasn bad at all but just not that good either imo0.0\tin one work terrible movies skips all over the place the is no flow storry lines start but never go anywhere patterson not worthy of the suit it just painfully drawn out and looks like its done on 100k budget0.0\tthere are lot of useless scenes and main character always moves so slow in order to get movie even longer it seems movie is produced for cinematic experts rather than for general public after you spent wasted three hours of your life you try to persuade yourself and friends that there was something spectacular in this movie don lie to yourself just waste of time1.0\tthe story is great gotham city is dark and of course the batman this is absolutely fantastic can wait to see the sequel robert pattinson need more billionaires maybe for the next movie really enjoy the show congratulations dc1.0\treally love the vision and scope of this film matt reeves really delivered and the dark and gritty tone is just perfect really like batman and selina chemistry and the riddler is just terrifying easily my favourite movie in the year so far0.0\tthe batman character is not developed in the film it just clumsily sets the stage with narration of batman internal monologue that is directed towards the audience with exposition batman entire role in the film is to stare dramatically at people slowly lifting his eyes and whispering his lines the actor is stringbean and he moves slowly not much of brawler hero but he is skilled at giving long stares and standing stock still the plot is not impressive the villain motive is nonexistant why would you plug drive into personal laptop with an internet connection the plot hinges on this batman has jaded nightclub brawl to find catwoman by looking at picture of her stockings this is being hailed as great detective film what kind of detective can infiltrate or information gather without pummeling goons this film wanted to imitate dark knight while staging stringbean as smort investigator bat this film is waste of time with awful settings abandoned buildings and nightclubs awful acting stringbean never raises his voice above whisper even when proclaiming his vengeance on criminals and mundane plot which could not move forward without the implication that broots waymb is super genius big brain science man also the riddler villain costume is plastic bag on his face very cool0.0\twhy oh why woke police batman hate script could this film get get any more woke the whole move is rich white guy bad black ppl good no real script and would like my money and time back for this horrible film need more dark knight batman and less of this lazy writing hr film1.0\teverything about the batman is masterpiece from cinematography score action and story telling thank you matt reeves for this gem looking for to the sequel and spin off shows0.0\ttoo bad could have been good moved pretty slow and was very anti cop and white privilege was used out unpopular opinion but like the older batman better patterson did great job and colin ferrell did great1.0\tgreat cinematic experience although with some flaws mostly in narrative and structural sense this really feels like true batman movie and pattinson is right fit for it every single person involved in making this did exceptional job and poured their hearts in it but major props should go to the score cinematography makeup team like everyone has said before it is so refreshing to have superhero genre crafted on this level and looking like real cinema functions really well when it is procedural thriller but isn that interesting when it focuses on its mob subplots overall story isnt anything we haven seen before and doesn push the genre in any new way it just fine for what it is it also becomes too convoluted towards the end hour runtime is not entirely earned but it isn felt that much due to immersive world pacing loses some steam in the long second act before it picks up again towards the end and even with this runtime some characters and relations remain underdeveloped alfred especially there aren many memorable setpieces or scenes besides maybe the batmobile chase all in all very very good foundation for everything to come in this universe from spin offs to full trilogy colin farrell really nailed it by totally disappearing in his character with both his acting and mask1.0\tit kind of sad seeing all those bad reviews from angry people that hoped for another marvel or dc piece of cr just because it doesn include useless action scenes and tons of comic relief it does not mean it is bad movie see big number of bad reviews saying this movie is long and boring and that just proves my theory our present society wants stories easy to understand hot women fights and explosions in every scene silly and childish jokes in every single conversation they want to laugh they want to stop thinking or challenge their minds while eating popcorn for two hours happy because matt reeves the real hero here he hid an excellent batman story announcing it as another superhero movie getting the interest of the same people who made endgame the most successful movie in the box office and he hit them where it hurts the most he made them think with superhero movie that why they are complaining this is not boring movie neither long one this is batman and everything we want from him if you re reading this and didn like the movie please don confuse bad movie with bad taste there are lot of bad superhero movies out there this is not one of them1.0\tgreatness doesn have any review this movie has ever been the completed in every area but those the default curiosity is flick my head now on the 4th march we ll have achieved great day and great year1.0\tdark moody and focuses more on batman the detective than batman the super hero it closer to thriller than super hero movie in lot of places reminded me bit of seven but with sun city vibe now understand why pattinson was cast as batman because this iteration of the caped crusader focuses more on his pain and desperation to help people pattinson batman is more visibly emotional even with the mask on and he nails the role the music was absolutely on point too and created bucket loads of atmosphere and tension throughout the film the reason giving it and not 10 is felt the ending was tiny bit anti climactic it just wasn quite enough of pay off given how gripping the middle part of the film was still thoroughly enjoyed it1.0\tit clear to see why there are so many different reboots of the batman character each director puts their own individual spin on the caped crusader and the vision that matt reeves presents to us in the batman is magnificent tonally this film was spectacular it was brooding dark violent gothic exactly what wanted ve seen some reviewers who didn appreciate this tone which can understand it is all down to personal taste after all but if you enjoy your superheroes throwing more punches than witty quips then this is the film for you in terms of the performances can fault single one robert pattinson is fantastic batman he fully became the character and looked so domineering in the suit zoe kravitz was the perfect catwoman her back and forth with pattinson was real highlight of the film colin farrell as the penguin was perhaps my favourite performance however he was insanely good in this film truly transformative role and brilliant interpretation of the character jeffrey wright as well was superb the entire cast were stellar no exceptions another important aspect of batman film is gotham city itself and loved how they brought it together it had gothic feel which complimented the plot and themes perfectly the constant rain and predominantly night time setting made it visually enticing as for the story loved it we get to see batman doing some great detective work working closely with jim gordon and piecing together the riddler scheme there are so many references and world building that batman fans will love signalling promising things for any sequels and spin offs that get the green light the action was so well done the batman that we see is very rough violent still finding his feet and it makes for some terrific punch ups for three hour film it flew by it really is one of those films that you won want to end one of those films that really does live up to the hype0.0\tthis movie is complete rip off of se7en and so many incorrect interpretation of character we got emo bruce wayne in place of playboy bruce which was mask for batman both bruce and batman acts too similar and nobody at gotham seems to figure out this obvious thing like nobody wonder what weird emo rich guy do at his free time as this version don seem to give any delusion to public riddler is such rip off of se7en serial killer he copy so many things there is some kind of filter over the screen to make the city look dirty batman chooses to become fire fighter in place of batman which was completely wrong batman interpretation batman doesn kill coz he understands criminals and their situations as explained in batman begins but this movie make people believe that this version is right they teased court of owls in movie also they not only make catwoman woman of colour but she was talking about white privilege irony for comic version of character batman doesn seems to care about catwoman doing crimes at the end batman doesn feel like batman anymore1.0\tstory pulled me in villain brilliant acting great casting hmmm aside from couple quick fist fights never really felt like batman was on the screen at any point just some quiet guy in weird suit playing the role of private investigator that the cops hated why was he even wearing the suit half the time it didn feel like it was necessary know pattinson has lot more range than he was allowed to show here but felt the moody emo angle didn really work bale younger batman was also spoiled brat but seemed to have lot more depth but it was fun watching the story unravel and the supporting cast was amazing especially colin farrell who was completely unrecognizable yet somehow likeable the music especially batman theme put me to sleep overall mixed bag know what matt reeves was going for but don think he totally pulled it off1.0\tcinematically and artistically it is redounding success even though it bored me to tears in some places too many places it was good detective story with satisfying conclusion but getting there took lot of effort on my part absent sufficient action to sustain my interest little humor would have been nice not like that silly simon geek fest offered by thor ragnarok but line or two meant to loosen the dryness would have helped also the main villain was more annoying than villainous lot like luther in batman vs superman dc really sucks at villains can see any kids liking this so guess it ll be another demerit for dc unearned in this case because the movie is movie making at its finest it some some getting used to but eventually settled into the super powerless super hero like the director intended but it will not do for most of the people watching the batman suspect it shame too cause really applaud the effort hope there will be sequel that heavily armed with more fights less talking and at least an attempt at humor1.0\tfinally for the first time in solo setting in almost decade the world greatest detective is back in action the batman the matt reeves helmed vehicle which returns the caped crusader back to his roots as fledgling hero hits theaters this weekend in an explosive combination of action thrills and suspense thanks to the dour mood set by reeves and his team the batman reimagines the character as less an all out action brawler and more careful methodical influencer of events if the dark knight is the heat of comic book movies then the batman is unequivocally its se7en on halloween night serial killer calling himself the riddler murders the gotham city mayor kickstarting chain of events that involve himself the batman underground mob bosses and the wayne family itself the batman still fresh on the scene teams up with police officer james gordon as the city is plunged into seven days of grisly murder revelations and an ending that changes the face of gotham itself while not as bleak as se7en portrays the world reeves gotham is still detestable place filled with unlikeable gangsters underbosses goons stressed out law enforcement and innocent bystanders clocking in at staggering 176 minutes four minutes shy of three hours reeves manages to establish world in which the batman has been operating for two years selena kyle backstory the relationship between carmine falcone and gotham city bruce relationship with alfred and batman relationship with jim gordon and the motivations for the riddler while all that may seem bloated each is given its own time to shine each facet of all the players and their relationships to each other are clearly established and cleverly examined the cyclical nature of nerd rage that often traverses the internet is proven true yet again with the batman the warbling cries of anguish loosed by fanboys and fangirls online after the announcement of robert pattinson casting echo that of ben affleck casting heath ledger casting and michael keaton casting before that in tale old as time pattinson manages to dispel every negative rumor and delivers performance solid enough to silence even the staunchest neckbeard all the classics are present bruce wayne smolders and batman broods and while pattinson may not unearth any particularly new nuance character that been portrayed on the big screen for 30 years he still manages to make the material all his own bruce dynamic with alfred played by andy serkis with horribly little screen time is the most contentious it ever been with bruce constantly sniping at the beleaguered butler if there any downside to pattinson performance it in his action scenes the actor at times appears stiff but whether that due to his performance or the giant latex suit he in is difficult to tell zoe kravitz selena kyle aka catwoman is another standout of the film possibly kravitz best role to date her turn as the on again off again foil and romantic partner of batman is fully realized as her own character with her own motivations completely independent of batman while missing for chunks of time kravitz catwoman commands the screen when she there serving to both inconvenience carmine falcone and remind the audience that no matter what batman has his rules and will stick to them regardless of the situation jeffrey wright john turturro and colin farrell also populate the film as classic characters jim gordon carmine falcone and the penguin respectively wright shines as gordon his relationship with pattinson batman reminiscent of mills and somerset in seven wright and pattinson chemistry allows for great scenes between gordon and the bat some humorous and some deadly serious as the batman starts in the second year of bruce foray into heroics the two have formed somewhat uneasy bond of trust that threatened constantly throughout the film for his part wright continues an already stellar career with solid rendition of gotham top cop john turturro as carmine falcone could be considered the weakest link in the film if there is indeed one as one of the most powerful criminals in city that lousy with them turturro falcone lacks any sort of bite or menace to his performance in the film sparingly falcone just as much boogey man as the batman himself more talked about than seen as for colin farrell the actor appeared to be having the time of his life under all the makeup as the penguin one of batman traditional longstanding mob villains affecting an over the top new york new jersey accent farrell is captivating as oswald cobblepot gleefully chewing scenery around pattinson his shining moments come during the car chase teased throughout the trailers with outstandingly bombastic yet still realistic reactions from penguin if reeves and pattinson do indeed decide to return to this world in future installments it imperative they bring farrell penguin along for the ride paul dano also deserves praise in his performance as the riddler leagues removed from the spirit and energy that jim carrey brought to the role almost three decades prior dano riddler is more zodiac killer than colorful member of the batman rogue gallery another character sparingly seen batman is the main focus while everyone else rotates in and out of his circumference dano offbeat performance in the role is reminiscent of his time in denis villeneuve prisoners while the riddler motivations for his crime spree across the city are questionable there no doubting dano conviction to portraying the crazed puzzle obsessed villain the decision to turn the keys of the batman franchise over to director matt reeves proved to be one of the smartest decisions warner bros could ve made coming off both dawn and war of the planet of the apes both dour weighty character driven movies reeves brings these sensibilities to the world of dc comics as he manages to create depressingly realistic gotham city that could easily blend in with our own reality reeves handling of action scenes crafted on dawn of the planet of the apes and honed with war are cleverly staged brilliantly shot and guaranteed to get the adrenaline flowing while director zack snyder still holds the title for best batman action scene the second act car chase between the penguin and batman is one of the key standouts of the film thanks to reeves slick direction cinematographer greg fraser choice of camera angels and dynamics and giacchino pulse pounding score the chase scene is far and away the scene that the audience will leave thinking about reeves balancing of character work and action scenes of pacing the movie to feed just enough information to the audience to keep them on the hook is nothing short of marvelous greg fraser camera work throughout the film deserves high praise as well the rogue one and dune cinematographer manages to display his immense talents for knowing the best way to capture the tone of any particular scene overall when ranked against peers of its genre the batman will undoubtedly go down as one of the best comic book movies of all time every element of the film works congruent to every other element the production design of gotham combined with the actors that populate it are all backed the moodiest most unsettling score of composer michael giacchino career to date robert pattinson performance continues to shed fresh light on bruce wayne while kravitz catwoman hews so close to the character of batman year one it like they lifted her off the page reeves decision to finally create noir story catered to the monikered world greatest detective the one thing the character has been sorely lacking in virtually every large screen adaptation pays off in spades the audience is along for the ride as batman unearths one clue after the next the end result is delicious stew of mood action and tension that will leave the audience exhausted and mentally drained by the time the closing credits appear on the screen the batman is in theaters march 4th1.0\tlot happens during these hours and 50 minutes it not what expected but to me it pretty obvious how feel about this movie writing this review two hours after watching it after watching some other reviews some people point out obvious inspiration from seven 1995 or zodiac 2007 and while agree with these can make this list way longer how about the silence of the lambs 1991 how about shutter island 2010 needless to say tone wise this type of movies have been done lot but never in batman never in superhero movie have always described the dark knight as movie with absolutely perfect script script that has zero filler and every line has some kind of meaning that actually very rare in movies the batman script is not bad but it far from perfect let just say there are some ideas use of words writing choices that just feel absolutely unnatural and you can spot it even more because everything else feels pretty natural in this movie it overall very realistic take on batman somehow even more than nolan movies would say the batman is more in line with the joker main negatives for me would be rushed ending and some bad writing everything else was actually pretty solid so wanna talk about stuff that actually liked villains penguin is absolutely perfect and that chase scene between batman and penguin is easily highlight of the whole movie not only the chase but even the shoot out that happens before that and the way batmobile is revealed is absolutely epic the riddler is great easily my favorite version of that character out of any comic book movie animated series etc know it not very accurate version of the riddler but guess that one of the reasons why liked this new more serious take on this character have never been huge fan of original the riddler it was literally first time ever when actually took this character seriously it not even slightly comparable to batman forever but these were obviously meant to be very different takes so there no point to even compare them overall batman character was solid like him more than ben affleck take on batman like this costume more than any bvs or justice league costume but my favorite is still the dark knight 2008 costume to be completely honest was expecting this movie to be more faster paced even tho was well aware that it crime thriller detective story but even then at times it felt little bit too slow ironically ending was very much rushed in my opinion overall glad that batman is finally back because was hardcore fan of nolan batman movies and after 2012 completely lost interest because felt zero connection with bvs batman this new one has lots of potential and actually interested to see what they do next the batman is not bad movie at all but it far from perfect at least for me but overall it is easily one of the best dc movies since the dark knight rises1.0\tafter many years the batman has finally made its way to the cinema and managed to get to the cinema and watch it and here is my review for it the premise of the film sees batman in the early part of his career having to take on new foe which will push him to new levels and makes him question his whole motivations main character there was plenty of controversy when robert pattinson was cast as bruce wayne batman but actually had high hopes and have to say thought he did really good job he sold the pretty new batman well he is probably the most aggressive version of the character and you just feel the intensity radiating off of him but there is real development here and feel like the version we meet at the beginning of the film compared to the one at the end has changed quite bit and it is well handled this is very much batman film and thus sees him less as bruce wayne but when he is it works well enough it just isn the focus of the film supporting characters zoe kravitz plays selina kyle catwoman and she is great the dynamic between the two of them is really well handled and really enjoyed watching her character develop as there are some really interesting story parts with her paul dano plays the riddler and they do an amazing job with this character he is like horror character and seeing him go about his mission is fascinating and he was the perfect villain for this film his motivations were really well executed and this is redemption for this great character jeffery wright plays james gordon and this is another stellar depiction of the character he is tough but fair and really liked the partnership between him and batman despite their relationship being quite new there is clear trust and respect between the two of them colin farrell plays the penguin and despite being caked in prosthetics it is really strong character it feels honest to the comics and creates this really cool mob character that fits well in this universe story the story is expertly handled this is true detective story for the first time really in film it feels like batman is proper detective and this mystery kept me guessing and the twists and turns were really effective there are so many characters and plot points here that was worried it was going to be too much but it all fits together really well and nothing felt out of place to me and that was really impressive piece of storytelling to me script the script is extremely grim and this is no doubt the darkest batman film we have ever seen but it really fit this film and was fine with it this film writes all of its characters really well and keeps the film progressing in really interesting and for me captivating way style the film has an amazing style gotham has never looked better it is so bleak and grey that it feels like it is ripped straight from the comic books the harder hitting action is so well done and makes batman way more brutal and less reliant on gadgets which feels extremely fitting for the story that was being told here yes the film is hours but thought the film was paced really well and was never bored there wasn anything that thought should have been cut or trimmed down and fair play to matt reeves as director who did an amazing job here overall overall the batman is truly special comic book film that loved fans of batman will love it and it is must watch am not saying this film is as good as the dark knight but it is pretty close and that is great to see for the character of batman in 20221.0\tenjoyed the movie lot love that visualy that it like halfway between the 1989 batman and the nolan triology so it best of both worlds the story and acting is superb as well the only downside of the movie for me is the lenght of it think 2h50mins is just simply too much1.0\trobert pattinson batman delivered perfect performance as bruce wayne and with zoë kravitz they make nice team hope they will return soon also the visuals and the action scenes are the best thing in the movie one thing didn like is that it was kinda too long but that not something important0.0\tcat woman was just so stupid she just kept running around asking if anyone knew where her friend anika was which was pretty obviously not going to work just hated her the riddler was super annoying terrible acting if you told like ten year old to pretend to be crazy they probably would have giggled and yelled just like that it was just jumbled boring mess also took itself too seriously had no problem with pattinson never had much of problems with twilight either mean its not great but compared to bridgeton twilight is masterpiece is anyone else certain that movies get worse every year0.0\tthe film went on for too long the story was rather stale and there was just too much going on wish directors and producers would stop dragging out films for the sake of it actually wanted to fall asleep in the cinema out of sheer boredom1.0\tfantastic film the movie has everything which batman movie needs from the directing to the casting and the scene layout the actors did fabulous job and matt reeves did exceptional thus movie is up there with the best batman movies0.0\tfirst of all don quite understand why people giving this movie perfect score most of the time was drifted off because of how slow it is there was no connection with the batman character and the villain was lack of character this batman movie is probably the only batman movie that has no humour in it the movie was too dark most of the scenes are just way too dark pretty sure there was no day scene in the whole movie this batman movie is nowhere near good to any nolan trilogy0.0\tspoiler free thoughts on the batman it sucks oh you want details here goes in life music and art light and shade are important this lesson has not been heeded here this is one note movie it is unrelentingly dark both in tone and in visuals it almost impossible to see any detail of anything ever this darkness can be brilliant when used well however if the only crayon in your colouring box is black you have problem one example of this is batman movies typically show bruce wayne fair amount this is needed to make batman feel like real person bruce wayne gets about minutes of screen time here this batman is utterly one dimensional this leads me neatly to robert pattinson as suspected cannot or possibly did not act he plays the tiny handful of scenes as bruce wayne like petulant teenager he morose surly like an emo version of harry enfield kevin character when he batman he moves well and is quite imposing but the suit doing all the heavy lifting the fight scenes are ok that about it really they re ok there no sense of jeopardy really the batsuit appears impervious to guns knives bombs falling off tall buildings etc the one car chase is dull and rather pointless the omnipresent dark tone means you never see the batmobile properly or the batbike which leads to collateral damage is rampant and batman doesn give hoot all the other iterations of batman have shown concern for innocents caught up in the violence that occurs while he fighting crime this batman is about as concerned as us president ordering drone strike andy serkis is wasted as alfred phone call for jeffrey wright it gary oldman calling he wants his performance as jim gordon back he only said you could borrow it not steal it the riddler never has single plausible reason for his actions presented nor is his ability to do the things he does ever explored or explained he just the mcguffin to hang lot of bat activity onto if you want him to be motiveless loony like heath ledger magnificent joker then you need both better actor and more time to let him be that character colin farrell as penguin why what was the point he not significant enough of character in the film to make the hours of prosthetics worthwhile he ok suppose but no great shakes he doesn get to do very much except copy robert de niro turn as al capone in the untouchables is there one good thing yes zoë kravitz as catwoman shes outstanding she believable three dimensional character you care about who she is and why she does what she does the next batman movie needs to star her as catwoman and have batman as very secondary supporting character think that about it anyhoo if you enjoyed it then happy for you we all like different things and obviously all the above is just my opinion not the cold hard facts1.0\tthank goodness this was good made my top ten batman movies list yesterday and realized ve only seen 10 batman starring films so that means batman robin made the cut should that ever be in top ten and yes the batman was good great nope but solid movie that 90 detective and 10 action will say this new batman look is great as is the soundtrack and the amount of actual batman in the film vs just bruce wayne but no robert pattinson still cannot act to save his life thanks to val kilmer and george clooney he certainly not the worst bruce batman can see why this movie hours long though 30 minutes could ve easily been cut to make this much tighter and better repeat watchability because as of now really don ever plan on seeing this again and even saw batman robin few times it hours long because of the most complicated plot and since they made bats sooo much more human in this incarnation it really takes batman very long time to figure out the mystery will give another praise for how many mistakes he makes and how he learning did like that but still would ve preferred him getting to the core of the plot lot quicker it batman year two and he dealing with an incredibly smart villain while working with another vengeance seeking ally and while he jumping through one hoop after another more and more chaos is escalating really don have much negative to say about this other than the length and how both the villain and bruce are really not that interesting luckily and as stated above robert in the batsuit for grand majority of the movie and really dug that he looked great as the bat and while the movie pretty dark like way too dark despite the theme they really did make good use of his silhouette and surroundings will give kudos to zoë kravitz she was absolutely the best actor in the movie and best character to boot where was she when they previously hired halle berry if you choose to see this in theatres make sure you see it with dolby surround sound as that was awesome in this and once found out there isn actual end credit and found out what posted at the end left during the credits once the credits roll in the end just leave you ve already sacrificed hours save some time left at the end that not worth your time just google it to learn the secret message final thoughts here the updated best batman movies that ve seen batman the dark knight batman returns batman superman dawn of justice ultimate edition batman begins the lego batman movie the batman batman mask of the phantasm the dark knight rises 10 batman forever1.0\tthis is different batman that leans more into the detective noir side of the comic books if your used to the high octaine batman just don even bother and don wast time leaving review either yeah pattinson is little dry but feel like he nails it for the most part like said before this is noir style detective batman so the humor in the protag is straight laced and dry which he gets sometimes otherwise the rest of the movie just drips atmosphere yeah dirty cop corrupt system is over done to death but that also real life so shrug all in all loved it1.0\tthoroughly enjoyed the batman being big batman fan from comics and other adaptions loved the attention to detail in this movie it 100 graphic novel come to life the atmosphere is such mood from start to finish helped by the lighting or lack of the gothic look to gotham and the haunting soundtrack so glad reeves was given the creative freedom from wb to pull this off it won be for everyone and don mind that as it batman movie and unapologetically so the first two hours is detective story at its core whereas the final act moves towards the blockbuster feel but this doesn upset the overall tone didn feel like it was hours at any stage this is the first batman movie ve watched in long time where the story puts batman at the focal point and makes him the character you re really rooting for it definitely deserves its place along side tdk and mask of the phantasm can wait to watch it second time1.0\tthe batman 2022 is the darkest and most humane batman film ever to date every scenes music and plot are organically delivered there is almost zero comedy scene and the life of bruce wayne is perceived differently from the usual extravaganza we know of and pattinson eyes oh my those eyes deserve an oscar 10 10 could get nominated win few oscars0.0\tknow this is another reboot of the franchise and was supposed to take whole new approach but personally hated the movie it was always too dark to see any real detail and why was every day in gotham constantly bucketing down with rain the movie was depressing enough already without the constant downpour after what seemed an incredibly long wait was really looking forward to the movie but for me it was huge let down robert pattison may be earning kudos for his acting but his lack of physique was completely unconvincing for superhero movie hope this is the last one with this actor director combination doubt that will be interested in any sequels1.0\tthis film is very dark setting and film as whole and it fits perfectly its total length is almost hours too long do not know think that is personal did not notice it was not bored was really sucked into the story thought this version of batman was close to the batman stories read when was younger there were not that many stunts and gadgets thought that worked just fine even though the ultimate enemy was super villain and we also saw another famous batman enemy to me it was more fight against organised crime than it was fight against known enemies it was also more or less fight against one inner self liked this approach1.0\twhere is he although it did follow the darkness that many dc movies have the batman visual beauty is unparalleled from the first moment he walked out of the shadow batman radiated the same energy as darth vader usually in movies you want to see things clearer in the light but in this thriller when the night comes know that will be in awe it not surprising that this batman had the best suit of all batman it added lot to the largeness of the character robert pattinson clearly proved that he was the perfect bruce common theme in batman is that bruce is classy and beautiful rich man however here he rich and insomniac young man his look and struggle to solve the case turned him into an obsessive detective adore the direction of this movie to trim off lot of the comic canon and instead follow mystery thriller route the riddler transformed into the zodiac killer as he always should have been along with the fantastic scores the psychopath kept the tension at high levels for the entirety of the runtime as much as love it don think the batman is perfect movie although catwoman and alfred looked great they didn have as much screen time as wanted the main mystery itself sometimes meandered for me overall came in expected stars but almost got it still it phenomenal movie 100.0\tboring to dead low budget wasting time better watch netflix rate horror movie than this dull batman even john cena peacemaker is much better than this1.0\tit is probably the best movie in the superhero genre nothing comes close everything is top notch from acting to direction and music matt reeves is legend and so does robert pattinson paul dano was fabulous but my favourite was colin farrell man he was great0.0\tnot even 10 of dark knight rises so boring and slow batman uses few devices half way through the question arises between my family and is this ever going to end1.0\tve just finished it what movie what an experience and am so glad am one of the first viewers of this film the plot 10 10 twists 10 10 enjoyability 10 10 guys try to watch it in 4dx believe me the winds and the seats shaken now believe what david lynch said about cinemas to all who read this and are worried about batman hey buddy you re going to watch one of the greatest movies1.0\tthis movie is perfect great plot great acting worth watching hours mcu fanboys are giving this rating because they need lame jokes which are not funny they don need story they only need unrealistic fight scenes and fan service just ignore all the bad reviews this is definitely not star when you see star rating review you know it mcu fanboy0.0\treally don understand why people have double standard when zack snyder makes man of steel batman superman and justice league dark and lengthy it is bad and when other directors make such movies they make master piece0.0\twhat was this garbage this is not batman it weak spoiled brat and when the strong female black character entered the scene sorry it was too much this filth does not deserve three hours of my life go sell your idiotic vomit somewhere else1.0\twow what can say this movie was amazing from start to finish this is 1000x better than the overhyped spider man no way home movie have never seen batman movie before this movie blew my mind away robert pattinson was just superb as batman and for the rest of the cast just amazing first dc movie have watched and was not disappointed thank you1.0\twarner continues what they started with joker and presents genre film wrapped in comic book movie veneer instead of the the repetitive bland marvel superhero formula we get noir detective procedural movie darker and grimmer than even the dark knight series parents beware this is not movie your year old son who has batman lunchbox will enjoy this movie is closer to serial killer movie that just happens to take place in comic book setting right off the bat the setting takes center stage after nolan use of chicago as gotham the gothic splendor is back even if not quite as fantastic as in the burton series the new gotham feels lot like the one from the arkham video games very vertical very gothic hard to pinpoint in time and place cell phones and social media are everywhere as are modern high tech gadgets but at the same time the architecture evokes the 1920s while the police uniforms look like the 80s ones in the burton movies the cinematography is stunning and easily the movie strongest point along with the score batman movies have almost always had incredible scores and michael giacchino brings the story to life with grungy brooding score that shines not only during the action scenes but also rises to welcome heights during the few hopeful scenes as usual batman movies allow actors to showcase their talent and all of the cast here perform well robert pattinson is servicable though no bale and paul dano riddler is the classic high iq antagonist colin farrell absolutely steals the show in every scene he is in what genius move to cast him as the pengiun this is by far the best portrayal of this classic villain zoe kravitz is okay as catwoman she looks gorgeous but never feels like cat or serious physical threat she is tiny at 157cm this may have been role for someone with bit more physicality jeffrey wright overacts few scenes but is serviceable though he no gary oldman andy serkis does what he can with the little material he given but compared to michael gough or michael caine he one of the weakest alfreds so far the less is spoiled about the plot the better as the constant discoveries of new pieces of the puzzle are vital to keep the hour runtime from feeling overly long it quite an achievement that they rarely do until just before the ending this is not movie you watch for spectacle even if it has the best batmobile scene yet if have some criticism of the movie then that the finale is both underwhelming and feels tacked on colin farrell seems to be the only one having any fun here most of the other characters are rather one dimensional with batman and catwoman being angry most of the time and the riddler too serious there very little of his taunting and teasing from the comics or games the nolan batman films were actually quite lighthearted with lots of quips from characters with alfred being straight up comedian at times and most of the villains spouting one one liner after the next not so here even joker had lot of dark twisted humor which was sorely missing here there also distinct lack of chemistry between batman and catwoman as well as batman and gordon which robs some of their scenes of life in general the scenes of batman and the cops require little too much suspension of disbelief there no way they wouldn arrest him finally that there is one particular woke line about while privilege that will make virtually everyone in the theatre roll their eyes luckily it not vital to the story and will be very easy to excise in upcoming fanedits most of these are small caveats or personal tastes though objectively this is welcome return to form for batman on film and good setup for new cinematic batman universe if the ending is anything to go by there will be dream team of villains in the next one let hope reeves manages to find good use for scarecrow too1.0\tit seems much inspiration has been taken from the previous iterations michael caine influenced serkis alfred as did affleck batman as much as enjoyed returning to more realistic batman it was disappointing almost everywhere this batman moved like heavy weight but was built like small welter weight lacked star power and was probably an hour longer than it needed to be as fan of nolan batman am disappointed0.0\thollywood keeps remaking and rebooting and liberals give them the cash just burn your money or throw it out of the window boring couldnt even understand what he was saying why does he whisper all the time the enxt batman reboot must be 2025 and the woman short hair and masculine give me break am man throw me bone paid money for this1.0\tso nice to see that it is still possible to make blockbuster action movie that really has got cojones the good the acting performances are top they really are and acting is what matters firstmost the many different characters are true to life however weird this story might be still do believe in these characters they come to life before my eyes and they splash of the screen nice more good this movie has got an edge it dark it violent like it suppose to be direction soundtrack photography editing every technical detail is top notch what joy for my eyes not any good lasting whopping hours and 45 minutes is stretching it but this is one of those few action movies in which it could have lasted another hour and still would have been glued to the screen bravo they nailed it with this version recommended yes spread the word0.0\tvery boring to be honest it far too long they could of made it at least an hour shorter than what it is regret going to watch it poor attempt of film1.0\twarn you you better leave all your thoughts of previous batmen behind because this batman is very different from his predecessors once you completely unhinged your expectation from the late batmen only then you can truly enjoy this masterpiece1.0\twanna start with if you debate over which batman film was better then your not batman fan your just film fan who shouldn even compare them yet we ve only had one film from this franchise at least wait for trilogy also real batman fan will just be happy to get more content and new perspective of batman the batman is 10 out of 10 knew they wouldn let us down they know batman is to big to ruin it especially the characters you guys really thought robert was gonna do bad job you don think they would think over on who to cast for the batman come on now the casting was great the story was beautiful the action was as batman as you can get from the comics it was so well done they didn show us an origin story here but that intro was just so epic so glad they started like this super excited to see how the rest of the future films will turn out0.0\tfor me one of the worst batman movies horrible way to tell history didnt care about anyone in the movie some scenes dont make any sense in the plot1.0\tat nearly hours long the batman does not disappoint in the slightest pattinson gives his all as batman along side the supporting cast whom all gave great performances matt reeves directed this film perfectly giving the audience enjoyable crime thriller the script is tight and the score is simply incredible1.0\tthe pace of the movie is good was expecting to get bored but it really hooks you in glad that we finally get to see riddler in movie and btw you have to watch the post credit scene some spots could be better of course overall though it great cinema experience for sure0.0\tmost of the actors had no facial expressions and walked around just staring and scowling at eachother it was more of detective story than batman movie was far too long the film didn even need to have cat woman character she was terrible it was all bit random did like gordon to begin with but he ended up just staring and scowling at everything there was way too much talking and explaining everything throughout the best performance for me was from colin farell didnt even know it was him until googled it there was also line about white privilege which was completely inappropriate can count the times rolled my eyes wish could get refund waste of three hours and my money1.0\twas thoroughly pleased and impressed with this movie we get some of the best performances of all time across all batman films my only critique is that it long there are couple parts that seem to drag and feel some things could have been cut to make it little shorter1.0\tthe batman takes slower more methodical approach to the dark knight and deep dives into lot of the recon and stealth tactics that go into batman approach to stopping his foes as well as highlights the skills that batman has that have earned him the moniker of the worlds greatest detective the batman is also not afraid of recreating the origins of some of its characters to create deeper connections behind the downfall of gotham and all those responsible for it there is lot of commentary on human nature and the fact that most of us don operate on either side of black or white line but that the most detrimental of decisions are made in the shades of grey though there are villains there are plenty of relatable people found on the wrong side of the law taking focus away from the story being told really impressed with lot of the camera work and the fact that lot of tricks are used to blind the viewer to some of action giving us subtle moments of what just happened oh my and created eerie atmosphere by drowning out the sounds of what in front of us and cueing some masterful piece by composer michael giacchino to walk us through the action or aftermath of really well told writing the main core characters of batman catwoman commissioner gordon riddler penguin are played so well and all given so much time to breathe started to forget at times that this was my first go round with them pattinson has few brief moments where his blank edward not paying attention to bella face peeks out but is always overshadowed by his quick timed movements and his great batman voice that almost gives me christian bale meets keanu reeves vibes the batman is as gritty as we ve come to know the dark knight but is also meant with some welcomed moments of dry humor to lighten the mood in the darkest of scenes to be completely honest this feels like spiritual successor to my favorite movie of all time the dark knight and think any batman fan of all ages will be able to appreciate this film 101.0\there the deal ve seen every batman film ever made ve read and collected comics for over decades batman is one of my two favorite characters its takes lot to impress me when pattinson was cast lot of people got up in arms my thought was they did the same thing when it was keaton ll wait and see glad did he played version of bruce wayne batman we ve never seen he young and he still raw about his parent death he not the man he ll eventually become yet but he not newbie where this is his origin and honestly thank god it been done to death we see that he smart tough skilled but at times overconfident he makes mistakes he gets hit in fights he gets shot he gets stabbed there real back and forth here between fear and anger it harkens back to something bruce said to dick in the cult didn become batman to avenge my parents death did it to overcome the fear anger pushes out fear and this batman is decidedly more angry than any other one we ve seen cinematically this is the best batman film ever the viewer is forced to engage and understand things from context clues the way shot is constructed etc people who may not have liked it seem to harp on what actually made the film great if you appreciate good cinema you ll appreciate this see this one in the theater the wide shots are awesome and just won be the same at home it was well written well directed and very well acted really liked the 89 film but that was tim burton kind of dark this is gritty dirty film noir kind of dark its just simply better maybe most import we finally see batman actually be detective that supposed to be his greatest skill the previous films have placed too much emphasis on his ability to fight and his tech this was radical departure its really really good excited for more films in this vein don miss this one1.0\tnever thought anyone would be able to make another batman movie after the christopher nolan series but this is the darkest batman movie ever made and unbelievably well done the riddler was legitimately creepy even terrifying at times comparable to heath ledger joker this is one ll be watching again and having in my collection at almost three hours didn look at the time once thrilling scary entertaining and extremely dark take on batman well done matt reeves1.0\tno spoilers loved this new batman sure it was dark and depressing the film noir approach was fantastic idea the first hour did drag bit but once the plot kicked into full gear was invested pattinson was great as batman needed some more bruce wayne tho zoe kravitz was fantastic as selina kyle such great version of the character can wait to see her journey as catwoman play out in the future paul dano was great as the riddler he had an interesting approach to the character which scared me bit in good way if it weren for the slow first half would ve given it higher score but definitely full on invested into this version of the batman and can wait to see how it all plays out in the future1.0\tbetter version of batman robert nailed the character to diff level since the starting till end he maintain his poise storyline shows the new version of batman and associated characters which definitely spice up the movie0.0\tthis story could well have been told in hours stretched it till your nerves hurt casting for batman role was terrible you expect an older person that is successful looking businessman instead we get the weirdo from twilight the high ratings on here are fake sad but true1.0\tacting cast was good story was ok long and boring lot of talking and running around that leads to the same place expected minimum of 30 mins of action for hour movie and got 10 15 minutes tops it was batman and it wasn batman at the same time1.0\tfrom the first trailer in 2020 couldn believed my eyes that this is the batman film ever wanted two years was worth the wait from the fast and bland title cards all the way to the end credits it completely blew me away and left me with giant smile on my face this is definitely the batman film always wanted and never ever disappointed me ever this is now my favorite batman film and the credit goes to robert pattinson electrifying performance as the worlds greatest detective along with zoe kravitz as fantastic catwoman selena kyle colin farrell nailed it as the penguin and can forget paul dano who will go down inin history as the best riddler jeffrey wright is great commissioner gordon and andy serkis is wonderful alfred can forget to mention this this is the most extremely accurate version of gotham and the batman nailed it pattinson is now my favorite batman and can wait to see more from him 11 100.0\thow much batman is enough how much batman is to much think there is an argument to make that we have enough batman and other superhero nonsense to last several generations no need to make any more it is not like these superficial narratives are doing any good and positive things to culture in general so lets just agree that we do not need any more of this flaccid and mediocre nonsense be honest and just accept that superhero stuff is for children it is not way of life or moral compass it is fiction that is mostly ethically bankrupt to begin with there is little to be had in this movie it is just random studio pulp1.0\trobert pattinson hermanas that it gorgeous talented mysterious and pale as paper let not forget about zoe kravitz because she did amazing as well from all the batman movies out there think this is now my favorite paul dano is perfect for his role and looking forward to see barry keoghan as the joker1.0\twell what very noir film disguised as this next dc movie this one really hit the spot perfect casting excellent directing and delicately acted more than anything what story action and story weave together and unravel in way that even surprised me that not easy it is positive renewal of the action series kudos to dc see it1.0\tafter what feels like years of waiting and can remember how many delays it finally here the batman hits theaters and let me say it was well worth the wait let start off with the cast robert pattinson does fantastic job as the caped crusader really bringing something of his own to the role the supporting cast is definitely not asleep here either with zoe kravitz as catwoman colin farrel as the penguin jeffrey wright as james gordon and andy serkis as the famed butler alfred pennysworth all perform immaculately even side characters such as john turturro in the role of carmine falcone all do such great jobs obviously cannot and will not leave out paul dano as the riddler one of the best portrayals of the villain he is dark cruel ruthless psychotic and intelligent making him quite the foe for batman paul dano played him so well would say he is to the riddler as heath ledger was to the joker the cinematography was great especially in imax which by the way if you can highly recommend watching this film in any premium format you can find the score which am listening to as write this review was phenomenal michael giacchino was perfect pick of composer gotham city comes alive in very unique way when compared to say that of nolan trilogy or afflecks batman it fit the world matt reeves was building and couldn get enough also this film shows off batmans detective skills in ways modern cinema has not done making the film feel very noire with great dark tones and atmosphere it honestly didn start feeling like batman film until the second act also with this iteration came certain depth of emotion and great character moments that do not expect to see in batman film but it was very welcoming everything about this film fit so well in matt reeves vision of batman especially when it came to the bat mobile which will not talk about to much as wish to refrain from spoilers all will say though is that it fit robert pattinson batman so well there so much good with this film and very little bad personally would wish to have seen bruce wayne more as this film did focus quite bit on batman and left very little to no development for bruce but the film is titled the batman for reason hope in whatever possible sequel we see more of the penguin loved colin farrel as penguin and it was shame to not see him very much lastly alfred role was also pretty miniscule which was shame because andy serkis is great actor these are nitpicks but would also liked to have seen more explanation in the way of batmans tech and how all his gadgets worked personally also did not care to much for catwomans mask as wish her cat ears were bit more prominent but again these are all really nitpicks and don detract from the film in anyway this is truly strong start for what am hoping to become trilogy with the talent this film featured and the implications of sequel it all measures up to be one of the best trilogies since christopher nolan dark knight 10 watched in imax theater1.0\tthe batman is the best thing ever no exaggeration there contrary to popular beliefs this movie is about the most popular comic book character that goes way beyond that genre and is about going from broken to healing it kind of like if francis ford coppola produced remake of chinatown directed by david fincher that took place in the batman universe and was written while guy was listening to nirvana the score really captures the tragedy that is batman hero born of darkness that struggles to escape it for his entire life if he can free himself then maybe all the people he saves can was impressed by how they blended in elements from multiple famous batman stories year one long halloween earth and zero year yet the movie never felt bloated it all fit together so seamlessly and the movie plot flowed so organically grieg fraser as cinematographer is genius this isn just playing into the dark and gritty buzzwords that get every teen edgelord rocks off this is proper grim oppressive it feels like the walls are closing in the waxy and greasy and grimy lensing evokes genuine sinister dread every single member of the cast brings out the best in the characters they portray every frame in the mask we re drawn to pattinson eyes which express different complex emotions without line of dialogue look forward to seeing more of oz and gcpd in the spin offs and where matt reeves takes this creature of the night0.0\tnot sure when we re going to get movie that doesn need the current set of woke rules to survive but ll be glad when that happens this pile of trash is an insult to the series and pathetic follow up to the christopher nolan series in fact nolan version is so fantastic that nothing should ve been attempted for 50 years except ya know to spell greed you have to start with save yourself the three ours of visual puke and giant migraine and pop in any of the nolan dark knights into the dvd or fire it up on your streaming device and enjoy true masterpiece leave this one for the wal mart discount bin which should be happening before too long0.0\twithout doubt the worst movie so far out of hollywood this year hrs of dark gloomy scenes psychotic characters impossible plodding end we went due to high reviews should have know by this early critical tub thumping the patients are now running the insane asylum in hollywood batman may never live this down0.0\tthe first hour of this movie held together pretty well then after major event it seemed to forget what it was about suspension of disbelief went out the window even for superhero movie and the plot derailed to sub characters and surprise unrelated events that were not twists and had little to do with the main story by little mean nothing no spoilers but in one scene the batman wears one of those inflatable samurai suits they have in bars for play fighting when you re drunk there is random car chase that looks like it was filmed in the 80s that has nothing to do with anything except showing off the the batman mobile which looks like redneck built it from converted corvette pattinson is fine as the batman and an emo in eye makeup as bruce wayne kravitz is fine but misused superhero movies can be good most are these days why we have to keep hiring directors who don understand the genre is beyond me oh and it was way too long1.0\tthe movie shows batman is not invincible but he learns from his mistake and can be stopped and at time he also needs help 2nd half was an absolute treat excellent bgm not sure why dc refuses to use shed light while shooting at times the darkness gives your headache0.0\tafter long wait what saw was just not what wanted this batman movie is ok but not perfect or good by any means it was so dark depressing black why the hell batman is so weak and not solid why would he hit cliff with his head it not patterson fault he did great ut the overall movie was too long and boring and not my type1.0\tve watched the first two batman films directed by tim burton and they were dark and eccentric the first two films directed by burton are still my favorite classics joel version of batman forever is campy but there were bit of dark moments ve seen much of christopher nolan trilogy this rebooted film that we watched right now gives fresh perspective to the fans for me this film transcends over nolan trilogy the action is great and there are thrilling parts that kept my eyes on only wanted to see the action and fight scenes the atmosphere of gotham city is just like the same in tim burton films and nolan trilogy but very dark the film composing is amazing although the film was three hours long it still great to watch the action drama and thrills1.0\tenjoyed each moment each sound so glad that was the first film watched in cinema in 2022 glad it was real masterpiece and it didn let me down at all also the suit gotham city and corruption was perfect it real work of colors thankful for matt reeves for such masterpiece1.0\tthe 2nd movie for the dc black label not connected to the dceu and is its own thing like joker before talk about pattinson portrayal the batman leans more into the thriller mystery of movies in the 90 early 00 like kiss the girls seven along came spider which enjoy it does keep you guessing and the violence is ramped up pretty high even for pg13 rating paul dano second stint in dc movie since playing jimmy olsen in the box office bomb superman return 2006 but this time with experience being in other films especially the acclaimed movie prisoners 2013 believe contributed to his dark take of the riddler zoe kravitz sticks out the most as catwoman she easily displays on screen the dual identity of selina kyle and her alter ego colin farrell absolutely nails the penguin role now onto robert pattinson who has three roles to play one as the batman one as bruce the playboy billionaire and one as bruce and his relationship with trusted butler alfred pattinson plays the same emotion in all three just broody all the time which bring him across as one dimensional and dare say it like clooney batman just another dude in mask which is shame because the film is pretty good1.0\tthis movie is being praised for being the best batman movie ever definitely disagree think the dark knight did more for the genre and had better villain also feel that ben affleck still embodies both bruce and batman the best however this batman film is pretty decent it long dark and not as exciting as some action superhero flicks but it does some things well the story is pretty great and performances from the cast were better than expected first film actually like pattinson in the soundtrack was decent although not as great as hans zimmer in my opinion it looked visually pleasing as well if you don like dark superhero films you might not like the batman as it is quite dark but overall it is good film confused on how it is apparently the best batman film or how pattinson is the best batman but it definitely wasn bad1.0\twhy people are saying they were disappointed because bruce doesn smile he is freaking batman of course he doesn smile lot this is new take on the character and is good one the chemistry of robert and zoe is intense it have hours but they keep you there not really into emo batman get why he is introverted and rob make good job but the physique could be better in scene you can see is cgi love the movie and is good start of trilogy0.0\tonly cool part was colin farrell as the penguin but that was down to mostly prosthetics was trying to like robert pattinson as the batman but it got tedious will not get started on zoe kravitz as catwoman what sad shame of portrayal me ouch jeffrey wright annoyed me with his delivery paul dano disappointed me the most he such good actor otherwise good to see andy serkis working john turturro slipped into his jesus quintana bit overall the writing stunk the action was boring fell asleep twice not what was looking forward to at all this was not the batman films of yore and if had paid to see this in movie theater would want my money back so very disappointing stars because the color of the film was easy on my eyes1.0\tits hour movie all very dark slow drawn out but very good some parts can get very boring as there is little action in the movie but the action scenes thay there are are all very good1.0\tthink this might be the perfect part for robert pattinson generally find the less he talks the better similar to ryan gosling this was good detective movie set in gotham city reminiscent of something out of se7en blade runner or sin city having never read dc comics have no idea how true it is to the source material but enjoyed it although it did drag on for which it lost star definitely worth seeing0.0\tnot sure how so many people enjoyed this emo grunge batman movie that drones on and on in the most boring way had to play some games on my phone to entertain myself then go make food to escape the tedium of this long and drawn out completely non engaging movie1.0\tmust say that robert pattison is very good actor he evolved so much firstly when saw him playing batman was something like wtf he can be but he is badass if you didn like joker you should not watch this movie it would be waste of time for you am saying this because is not just an action movie it is more like thriller and in this film batman is not van damme is more like sherlock holmes1.0\tthe batman is undoubtedly great piece of filmmaking this is very much batman movie and not so much bruce wayne which understood because he still young and hasn figured himself out yet the detective aspect absolutely delivered what it promised my one complaint is ridiculous line that cat woman gives about white privileged people that was just completely unnecessary and took me out of the film if you want me to fully enjoy film it needs to be absent of identity politics escapism is why we see movies and this film mostly delivered1.0\tthe best opening superhero sequence and arguably the best superhero film have seen since infinity war and the dark knight matt reeves batman is dark bleak gritty and foreboding it is everything batman film should be the theme is vengeance and its red colour palette is so masterfully painted throughout the film you can help but feel engrossed in the plight of the young batman the score is captivating and tense and creates an atmosphere of terror and with the constant rain you can help but feel engrossed in the city of gotham the cinematography is beautiful the shots of batman coming out of the shadows the car chase scene all action sequences are mesmerising really enjoyed watching younger darker brooding batman only two years into the role the tech wasn as innovative the gadgets not as powerful the suit not as indestructible batman himself wasn as perfect injured multiple times in battle and not pulling off every landing it was great to see it is why we love batman he is real with no powers yes rob pattinson was bit emo in the role with his hair and make up and didn love him as bruce but as the bat he was terrific paul dano as the riddler was what you would expect fricken awesome zoe kravitz was great as catwoman and colin farrel as the penguin was good but not sure why dress him up in fat suit when they could have found chubbier just as good actor to play the role the movie is long at hours but it doesn feel it at no point during the film was checking my watch or feel like it was slow found it actually quite scary thanks to paul dano performance especially the online community aspect of things and the call to arms which is all to realistic and the flooding was actually quite hard to watch considering what is happening at home didn think rob pattinson would pull it off but he did very impressed1.0\twent to the cinema with really open mind wanted to invest but came away confused at to what type of film had just watched was it stylish yes was the acting good yes it could have been so much more though the editing didn work for me it was 30mins too long it wasn tight go see it for yourself1.0\tas huge batman fan this movie was dream come true but the batman has it flaws and doesn manage to surpass the dark knight as movie plot 10 pacing 10 cinematography 10 acting 10 soundtrack 10 the score is absolutely amazing but the main theme gets played too often as batman movie 10 as movie without bias 10 probably my favourite superhero movie of the past few years0.0\twhat else can say it long movie consisting of scrawny batman walking for an hour and half boring villains boring heroes and boring characters you should avoid this snoozefest at all cost1.0\treally great movie definitely recommend it was apprehensive going in as big batman fan but it didn disappoint the acting is amazing gotham looks incredible and the score is brilliant1.0\tdecent movie and very artsy but not for children good cinematography good acting ingenious casting was expecting the old genre of batman movies and in some ways was disappointed and in other ways surprised1.0\tthis movie gets batman right surrounding him in dark mystery with saw style traps used to kill corrupt people this film holds suspense so well running multiple subplots and the main plot perfectly in sync the score cinematography acting and script are perfect this film is brilliant can wait to see what they do next0.0\tyes that batman and robin at least could laugh at how horrible arnie was this movie evoked no feeling at all discovered my seat reclined but left before fell asleep pattinson would have been better in crow reboot farrel looked like he was playing de niro playing the penguin trying to be big slobby mob henchmen the penguin is top tier batman villain not henchmen0.0\twith it some pro critics hated on certain production because it pretended like color wasn an issue for the most part but that production had grass roots word of mouth cheering as response it clear from the people re views that reminding people that this person is black and that person is white only divides people this movie seems to have been made around touting the romance of batman and catwoman and politics let face it there are lot of 1s on side note it tragically funny that there is so much going up in arms about staying faithful to fictional character and comic book but also this trend of being loose and fine with historical fiction the term historical fiction is sadly laughable in itself1.0\tbefore attending the imax preview screening saw expert from the mashable review which read imagine if david fincher made batman movie but it was censored to air on televisions at walmart maybe it just because had that quote on my mind but couldn help thinking in story and style it was incredibly similar to fincher 1995 film se7en seven of course this movie gets the edge because of all batman wonderful toys1.0\tthe true meaning of perfection everything is perfect everything everything robert pattinson is perfect zoe is perfect all cast is perfect the director is god of directors no more talk no more details it will be the first movie in history that got 10 10 iam sure0.0\tdon understand the high ratings here if this movie was or 10 what was then dark night 20 30 3h of my live which never will get back the movie was boring and seeing pattison as batman just worried me because in the movie it seems several times that he was near suicide so depressive that prefered seeing him in therapy than solving crimes just terrible they simply killed batman and bruce wayne0.0\tcan only assume the high ratings are from bots story which could have been written by year old lots of hollywood claptrap white privilege mentioned of course and we ve all had enough of all this woke nonsense so boring and too obvious nothing new and good job they didn pay pattinson by the word as 10 doesn go very far nowadays just avoid it at all cost1.0\tfirst of all as die hard batman fan was completely satisfied after watching the movie first and half hours of the movie was insane and it was full of some scenes that gaves me chills the story was different and great the performance by pattinson was insane and he became of my fav batman and it is the first movie that shows the detective version of batman zoe kravitz did well the background score blown my mind in every single scene dialogues are well written in some of the important scenes the cinematography is genius especially in the bat mobile chasing scene there is surprise at the end of the movie and there is no post credit scene overall the movie is masterpiece and it is definitely one of the best cbm film1.0\tnot going to go too much into detail the story was phenomenal and loved how it more of batman as the world greatest detective as we haven seen that much before there were definitely parts of the movie that could ve been cut to be honest cutting penguin and cat woman out wouldn change the story ton parts would need re writing but personally feel like they weren needed here however there were phenomenal characters0.0\tbig budget big bore ve been batman fan for 65 years they have yet to make really good batman movie the nearest to decent interpretation was the dark knight nothing about this movie worked for me1.0\tmatt reeves the batman is such hyper realistic and thoroughly nuanced approach to the caped crusader we all know and love for me it didn quite reach such olympian heights that most people have raved about since its release the film does meander bit in the first to second act and is very meticulous in the portrait it is trying to carve not just for the portrait of batman and bruce wayne but for the portrait of gotham city in and of itself and that can be to the film fault at times however this film emphasizes the goth in gotham if you get what saying the performances across the board are all fantastic the cinematography is pure exotic bliss the score by michael giacchino might be on of the best scores ve ever heard the film doesn even feel remotely close to three hours the writing is seasoned yet nuanced and the direction by matt reeves is trendsetting the batman establishes brand new motif on the legendary character in ways we never could ve imagined on the big screen it neo noir political detective thriller basked in the ambience of gotham city through the eyes of the bat the filmmaking itself is like the perfect marriage of fritz lang and david fincher through shiny altar even with my flaws this film is not to be missed all the talk about twilight talk about robert pattinson will cease1.0\tthe cast the music the cinematography everything in this movie was spot on you could definitely tell it was hours long but it did earn its runtime pattinson gives bale run for his money and zoe kravitz mean what not to love the highlights for me in the cast were jeffery wright and john turturro who is always terrific him and wright stole every scene they were in really well shot and super dark and intense like really good crime thriller type movie the ending almost didn do it for me and could knit pick but overall this movie was pretty flawless 101.0\tfastest hours of my life and this movie ended like times and it still keep going totally enjoyable and doesn feel too long at all like critics said the characterization of batman as the world greatest detective is totally spot on this is an absolute definitive batman film dark gritty focusing more on his detective skills as he is the world greatest detective1.0\teverything ever want from batman movie it also really captured the same vibe as the arkham games really liked pattinson version of batman my favourite one yet can wait for sequel1.0\tthe truest defining portrayal of our caped crusader as the worlds greatest detective on the big screen year one meets arkham knight with gritty ground breaking psychological twists left and right more batman rogues gallery please welcome to the batmanverse1.0\teven the introduction scene was already terrific probably the most intense movie ve ever watch don expect this to be superhero kind of movie there almost no comedy in this movie if are expecting this movie will be full of tech full of sci fi don just don again this is not superhero movie batman here is pretty much gimmick of what actually happened in the movie and yes this is far more darker than any of dark knight trilogy cos imo none of tdk trilogy was dark those are outstanding movie but not thrilling dark one1.0\tthe rap on the films of the dceu especially the films directed by zach snyder is that they are too dark dour and downer with very little joy or sunshine in the images or themes the writer and director of the new dceu film the batman matt reeves cloverfield has one simple answer for you hold my beer doubling down on the dark themes imagery and attitudes of all involved the batman is hour epic that is unrelenting in it bleakness with constant rain and dark images with not peak of sun or color in the entire film this bleakness and the slowness of the first of this film will turn off the average viewer and will thrill only the most diehard of fans and that too bad for the last hour of this film is pretty terrific paying off the long setup beforehand with confrontation between batman robert pattinson and the riddler paul dano that rivals just about any confrontation scene in comic books movie history this side of heath ledger joker let start with the overwhelming look and feel of this film it is downer gotham city is yet again city in decay with the bad guys over running the good guys which begs this question why would anyone join the gotham city police department but director writer reeves is is sure handed in his approach to this material and he is unwavering in his bleakness it is strongly directed film that knows what it wants to be and does not pretend to be anything else nor does it apologize for being what it is in this world is dropped robert pattinson the twilight films as the titular batman and he is perfect choice for this role in this film his batman is morose dour thoughtful and razor focused on being vengeance he is not interested in being good guy or superhero rather this version of batman is focused on being really good detective ferreting out evil doers and administering punishment when they are caught this film barely mentions batman alter ego bruce wayne and when pattinson is on the screen in the guise as bruce wayne he looks uninterested in being bruce wayne he rather be batman and this is compliment for that is how this movie portrays this dual role batman is disguising himself as bruce wayne and not vica versa assisting batman in his detective work is lt james gordon the always terrific jeffrey wright the only honest cop in corrupt police department these work as detective team and this film often times feels like detective procedural some liken it to seven with brad pitt morgan freeman look at it more like the first season of true detective the one with matthew mcconaughey and woody harrelson dark and interesting in their search for the bad guys as is typical of these types of films we have rogues gallery of villains some fair well an unrecognizable colin farrel as oz the penguin and john torturro as mob boss carmine falcone while others fair less well peter sarsgaard as corrupt district attorney gil colson and unfortunately zoe kravitz as selina kyle catwoman both of these roles are not fleshed out well kravitz hits the screen looking good in her cat suit and while there is unmistakable sexual chemistry between catwoman and batman not it should be noted between selina kyle and bruce wayne but this only takes the character so far and selina really wasn the bad ass conflicted villain hero that one would expect pleasant surprise was the performance of the always interesting paul dano as the riddler he underplays this character in much the same way that most have overplayed him clearly this is smart if mentally off person who talks through riddles but has an overall plan to bring down the bat and the city not to spoil this film but it didn really grab my attention until after the masked riddler was unmasked and that was very late in the game almost too late and that the problem with this film the last hour is terrific but one has to sit through hours of dark dour setup to get there and for most that journey will not be worth the payoff letter grade stars out of 10 and you can take that to the bank ofmarquis1.0\tthis film was absolutely fantastic easily the best batman portrayal ve ever seen still think christopher nolan the dark knight is the best batman film but this was really close to topping it the film itself was like nothing expected coming into the theater ii knew from following the development that it was detective story but had no idea how true that was this film is true neo noir masterpiece paul dano as riddler was incredible oscar worthy even robert pattinson as batman was such good choice he brings this darkness and this brokenness to the character that is so needed for this version of batman to work in this film zoe kravitz colin farrell and jeffrey wright all brought their game and it shows on screen every time they appear john turturro as carmine falcone was brilliant choice his few minutes of screen time bring presence and chilling gravitas to the role that really helps define what gotham city has become in this film the plot of this film is dark winding descent into the twisted underbelly of gotham one that at times it feels like even batman can never escape from the entire cast worked so well the script was so tight the cinematography was beautiful the score by michael giaccino was stirring and breathtaking at times while haunting and unnerving at others matt reeves nailed it with this film truly hope to see sequel to this film at the same time don want one because this is move that can stand on its own as cinematic achievement without the need for sequels matt reeves the batman is easily one of the best superhero films ever made but that feels like an insult to this film because this film is so much more than that this film is neo noir masterpiece that can stand up against the likes of se7en and hold up for years to come truly recommend every cinema fan go see this astounding film and see it on the biggest screen you can 101.0\tfirst of all like many was also critic when robert was selected for this intense role and man he made all of us fall in love with his awesome performance movie was great and it was nice to see the detective side of the batman all of the other actors were superb too waiting for sequel or trilogy1.0\twow first things first want to mention the cinematography the use of dark light in contrast with reds and blues really set the mood and setting beautiful the soundtrack was beyond amazing it put the perfect mix of dark intense and realistic into play and projected it perfectly before watching was bit unsure of robert pattison playing batman as it was drastic change from his usual played characters was 100 mistaken he did such an amazing performance bravo to him and hope he gets awards for this as he most definitely deserves them paul dano as the riddler was nice change from the usual intelligent psychopath that is portrayed love how he was hermit and introverted as well as strategic and calculated beautiful story that is perfect set off from the comics as well as other pieces of cinema1.0\thaven enjoyed batman movie this much since the tim burton ones have lot of beef with christopher nolan trilogy specifically because there are things in his directing that really bug me to no end am of the firm belief that his trilogy was an action movie filled with social messages that were dubbed under the name of batman so they could sell but we re not here to talk about nolan but matt reeves reeves that was the first to pay respect to batman detective abilities and really give more weight to the noir feeling of the hero instead of only the action he dressed robert pattinson to fit the bat suit in spectacular sequence of slow motion movement and eerie side glances that could chill your very blood and make no mistake pattinson steals the show in every scene he is in whether on the forefront or the background you can feel his very presence everywhere paul dano as the riddler gives new cillian murphy scarecrow esque presence as madman with mission as the intellectual nemesis of batman who is trying to force his way to the common conscience as more of beatdown vigilante wish he had something more to distinguish himself apart from the big glasses but guess that wasn the point colin farrell was great penguin although feel like he emulated lot from danny devito own performance in batman returns while he could have given the character something new wasn really impressed with zoe kravitz catwoman nor john torturro as carmine falcone for kravitz whether it was her own lack of acting skills or reeves direction feel she was really limited and not an exact embodiment of catwoman but more of an eye candy in leather for torturro it something always had gripe with the batman cinematic and serialised universe that they never made him feel as important as character where he is big big fish in the comics and despite the great feeling of the movie think three hours is bit too long for it to run smoothly you begin to feel taxed in the final third of the movie if have to mention something apart from pattinson how you like him now that truly enjoyed would be two things firstly the musical score which really set the tone since the very first scene with its wonderful use of bells and cellos second it was the performance of jeffrey wright as jim gordon who wonderfully balanced his character as someone loyal to batman while also maintaining his professionalism and will to serve justice also appreciated that we didn have to re introduce characters or relationships all in all definitely watch it again and can wait to see what the duo of reeves and pattinson will bring in the future finally batman movie can enjoy1.0\tit sets dark mood which loved the cameraman crew did fantastic job with the red accents and how it didn feel jumpy the music was amazing too however the plot wasn the most impressive villain is too similar to joker and doesn get much development also the fact that riddler knows batman identity gets almost no development mostly because batman almost never speaks it is also too dramatic at some parts trying to make bruce look cooler than he is liked how it was made some realistic than dark knight however it still missed brutality and blood just to get rating 15 good film with its own deep mood but with weaker plot lines and complicated motives and it doesn have moment that particularly stands out so won be rewatching it any time soon1.0\tlove the movie ve been training for the bathroom and kitchen and bathroom and kitchen and bathroom and funny thing alot you have question so much you are the taliban fighters in new one for0.0\tit felt interminably long permanently raining and permanently night didn care about any of the characters so after particularly looong car chase in the dark we decided to cut our losses and leave about 5hrs in any episode of the gotham tv series would ve been hugely more entertaining0.0\tvisually well done but that alone is not enough to carry the film and sadly the rest is utterly boring it good that reboots or what ever the 9th batman is called now try new routes but this one sadly fails at least for me1.0\tthis movie was great from start to finish enjoyed this superhero movie that actually had good intriguing mystery story that kept me on the edge of my seat no corny jokes not your cookie cutter marvel movie dc this and joker is where you excel stick to the dark and gritty loved it for all those hating on rob because of certain movie series the guy can act and is so much more than twilight loved his batman bruce wayne would love to see sequels everyone did great job1.0\tthe batman is the next crack at gotham masked vigilante and this is undoubtedly an absolute classic so personally cannot stand marvel movies and the superhero genre is been beaten to pulp by no so had moderate expectations for this well was blown away this movie is noir film that is closer to hitchcock than it does the avengers it has sequence taken right from se7en that had me shouting with joy in the theater batman has always been dawned as the worlds greatest detective but in movies he is mostly scene kicking butt and threatening people this movie probably most accurately depicts the comic version of the batman that we have seen on film the batman is shown to be complete mentally ill damaged psychopath in his own right and it makes him so engaging the performances are terrific highlighted by paul dano as the riddler pattinson plays better batman outside the suit than in it think sometimes the character is very clunky and awkward at times overall the makes the dark knight his own though and without him the film doesn work as well as it does zoe kravitz was the best have ever seen her and she too is highlight along with wright performance as jim gordon the story is completely engaging it isn exactly who done it as we obviously know but it is still very thrilling mystery as we try to solve the clues and follow the case the ultimate test is to take the batman out the fights and the flash and you still have really good film absolutely impressive effort the future of this character looks so bright even if the movie itself isn1.0\tthe batman was one of my most anticipated movies of this year was extremely hyped for it and it lived up to all the hype had absolutely loved this movie everything about it was fantastic from the acting to the writing to the cinematography and everything in between zoe kravitz is the best catwoman we ve had since michelle pfieffer and colin farrell as penguin was phenomenal and don want to hear anything about twilight robert pattinson is the best batman we ve ever had yes even better than bale affleck keaton and conroy but the real stand out was paul dano his performance was absolutely terrifying and his character arc was amazing much much better than that batman forever fail the batman is gripping beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and sometimes genuinely scary psychological crime thriller that gives bruce wayne the grounded detective story he deserves with movingly layered catwoman and horrifyingly unhinged riddler my favorite scene in the entire film was the interrogation it just as good as the one in the dark knight and sometimes even better the batman is the best batman movie we ve had since lego batman and gonna give it an1.0\tthe batman is an overdue zeitgeist piece for the character since co creator bill finger finally received official credit in october 2015 alongside batman other co creator bob kane every batman film prior to batman superman lacked this key credit and now the batman reintroduces the dark knight in uber gothic neo noir style about damn time because this film does its damnedest to be re inventive with the character whilst knowingly focusing more on the investigative aspect of batman and still treating him like comfort food kind of action hero this film is long origin story that skips the endlessly retold origin of bats thank christ we didn see that again and shows his reclusive nature as vigilante serving his city rather than himself bruce wayne is not the playboy he made out to be in other takes but loner who not over his losses this bruce is fighter who cares more for others than he does himself which is the definition of hero sure the batman side of bruce character is strong here but his alter ego thing could have been done just little differently to make playing dumb that much easier some critics have been somewhat divided on the film excessive darkness but think it works in the batman favour because film noir is supposed to be like that yes there glimpses of humour here and there in many of these stories but cynicism and awareness of the world complications is fundamental to film noir storytelling batman is no stranger to flickers of humour in his otherwise dark life and the film has enough sprinkles of levity that it isn joyless experience the film is tribute to stuff like chinatown and alfred hitchcock whilst leveraging from batman stories like year one the long halloween and zero year the batman shows that dark can still be fun and endearing despite what others might have you believe it film that superhero origin story just as much as it neo noir fever dream owing itself to stuff like vertigo and blade runner especially one sequence involving the riddler it long film that could have had some of its stuff trimmed out but the film as whole still works as nice reminder that batman still has lot of narrative breathing room to spare the batman is dark superhero tale that still inspires the hope one seeks in these movies and that reboots don have to be by the numbers square one stuff with characters we already know like an old friend what needed for these movies is confidence in vision and this film serves that up in spades it ll be fun seeing where batman goes from here onward maybe we ll get to the bat family someday sooner than we think stars1.0\tit gives you time to breath and you will need it cause when the movie kicks in it like batman kicking his opponents you ll need your time to realize what just happened1.0\tthe entire movie was work of art the storyline was interesting and made you want answers the cinematography was beautiful and captivating add to that dramatic score that had you at the edge of your seat the choreography in the fight scenes are sharp and fast unlike the slowness in ben affleck batman robert pattinson has come along way since twilight if you have seen his recent filmography then you know that he can master any accent and is very articulate in his craft becoming the next batman is just the cherry on top he did an amazing job in this role the chemistry between him and catwoman is palpable zoe kravitz is sultry smooth and her character has lot of heart she was the perfect catwoman and we need to see more of her in this role colin farrell as the penguin is truly shape shifting at its best not only does he not look like himself but he mastered the mobster voice and character he was actually pretty likable he had couple of great one liners that made the theater burst out in laughter heard he getting mini series as the penguin and can wait to see that paul dano as the creepy unhinged villain genius if you seen him in prisoners then you know this role was made for him the movie was truly masterpiece the only flaw is that it was far too damn long just when you thought the storyline wrapped up and the movie was ending there was more movie left there were several scenes that were unnecessary and could ve been cut to at least make this hour movie0.0\tfirst of zoe kravitz is so bad that it quite clear that this is someone who gets cast because of famous parents she basically ruined any scene she in when she opens her mouth wooden boring and untalented overall the movie was shot way too dark and this new sparking batman simply doesn have the physique or the screen presence needed would by the way be great if not every movie had to be so woke these days pass on it and remember the old batman movies instead1.0\tafter nolan fantastic trilogy didn think another batman movie would be needed for quite some time after hearing this one get announced remained pretty skeptical but was blown away by matt reeve interpretation cinematically this movie was absolutely brilliant and the opening 10 or so minutes absolutely pulls you in to this dark rainy gotham world and hooks you for the next almost three hours was it on par with nolan films probably not quite but it was dang good and that all that matters the storytelling here was fincheresque this was like bruce wayne in season of mind hunter pattinson turn as bruce wayne was spot on and proves that he is here to stay in the action world his days of being known as the shiny vampire boy are over0.0\tit must have been easier and cheaper to shoot movie so dark that the audience can actually see it pattison didn do anything to wow in here his performance in tenant was big step to dispel the notion of him being one dimensional but this movie has set him back very disappointing1.0\tthis is version of batman that is very much grounded in somewhat plausible version of reality early on it is established that he is simply skilled fighter in resilient suit this batman is more celebral and out there doing the detective work which he seems to excel at even the riddler is semi realistic composite of real life serial killers and domestic terrorists pattinson is intense and the supporting cast are strong some of the camera work is superb and the lighting and use of voice over gives noir quality it did feel very long and the action was not particularly memorable but overall very enjoyable new take on the franchise1.0\tthis is the darkest batman has ever been written and the best gotham city till date but the problem with this film are its stake are not that high and we are never in fear for batman ever the film is serial killer detective drama more than superhero film would have minded it if batman smiled little bit it feels like robert had constitution throughout the film if can be more frank the film is more about riddler than batman itself this batman is not children freindly at all the pacing is terrible and to top it off the runtime is nearly three hours ffs the cinematography and score is commendable but they couldn save the film robert pattinson did decent job for what was given to him but the best part of the film is without doubt zoë kravitz as catwomen she did the best job and one of my fav overall disappointing ventur1.0\tthe batman is absolute amazing film from director matt reeves with the beautiful cinematography and shots of gotham and the cast is spectacular with performances from robert pattinson zoe kravitz jeffrey wright colin farrell john turturro and the mvp paul dano this movie is gritty and grounded take on the dark knight like you never seen before and is definitely the scariest batman yet each member of the cast gets there time in the light and the action is definitely the best you will ever see in batman movie it was detective noir film that was waiting for from batman and made it feel like the arkham games and comic books brought to life this batman film deserves to be right up there with the dark knight and is another comic book film for the age1.0\tbeautiful to look at with its noir dark tone had some stunning cinematographic shots and action sequences decent intricate plot with multiple of well integrated elements and solid side characters loved colin as the penguin especially catwoman complemented the story nicely how about the soundtrack though eerie but beautiful reeves however went safe with the story no extraordinary or shocking moments but rather well thought out plot with good character focus on wanye history best moment the car flip scene and the upside down shot epic0.0\tfirst off thinking that maybe the batman story is getting kind of overtold maybe hollywood should lay off just trying to retell the same superhero stories over and over and over again and come up with some new ideas instead know know they sell yup they suckered me into going yet again maybe shouldn have gone to what feels like my hundredth batman movie and expected some fresh entertainment right perhaps just batmanned out but seriously felt that this movie was far too long long and dreary slow characters took waaay too long to say something way too long to do something even waiting for batman to walk from one place to another sometimes warranted an eyeroll there were too many pauses and too many times was thinking oh just get on with it as far as the characters acting goes robert pattinson was very good batman though the bruce wayne side of the character was pretty much ignored make him recluse and you don have to bother developing that side of the character right jeffrey wright did great job as gordon would have never guessed that was colin farrell as the penguin amazing makeup but the character wasn really developed much not that there wasn enough time to do so in this dreadfully long movie zoe kravitz filled out the catwoman outfit nicely but other than that was not feeling that casting once the combat mask came off paul dano had all the creepy facial expressions of demented psycho but would have liked to have had the reveal and some peeks at the riddler during the planning and implementation of his dastardly deeds instead of just seeing him except for in costume after the fact did the end of the movie leave me feeling like wanted more nope not in the least1.0\tthe batman delivers more than what it promises well knit screenplay mind blowing action sequences ample twists turns robert pattinson hits it out of the park matt reeves is an incredible storyteller watch it0.0\tok so the batman movie showed us the challenge of putting twilight male vampire in the shoes of bruce wayne batman which means less air time of mister wayne and more time showing batman it also displays more distant wayne with no friends and no girlfriend emo bruce is bit sad his kisses with cat woman are bit sad and weird not bad of movie little long and too many characters for start of franchise series hope in future sequels mr wayne has more friends then just alfred pennyworth and two kisses from cat woman gotham wants and needs less silly batman to be batman is one thing but to be the batman is totally different situation be the batman twilight be the batman1.0\tto be honest the anticipation for the batman was way out of the earth orbit it would be disappointment if the latest winged mouse movie was less than phenomenal and can assure you that matt reeves has delivered cutting edge visual work perhaps the best in hero movie an actor direction at the highest awards level and growing narrative until the third act which is where the film retreat is not on the same level of technical virtues but delivers brutal real experience and renewal that the character needed so my rating is 10 eagerly awaiting the sequel to robert pattinson violent batman1.0\tthink david fincher directing batman film gotham is like the world of seven and fight club filthy and dark and dangerous yes this may not be as impactful as the dark knight was but don think any batman film could be because they will all follow in it footsteps felt it had similar tone and feel to it despite being more gritty than nolany almost like this would make much better prequel to the dark knight than batman begins pattinson in my opinion is easily the best batman and it is maybe my favourite interpretation of the dark prince if was an actor would feel terrified being gotham villain after heath but paul dano was born for these sorts of roles and is great cinematography is amazing with some of the fight scenes the club one and the one in the dark with the guns flashing so cool makes me proud to be an aussie is almost like slow burn yet the pacing is incredible did not feel like three hours at all was scared about catwoman as have never liked her in the previous films but zoe was great and the character was finally interesting and important to the story the buddy cop aspect was great something quite new to the cinematic story of batman but really worked and gordon was played brilliantly by wright finally thought falcone and the da played by scarsgards were really great brilliantly acted and falcone especially was surprisingly menacing maybe my favourite unexpected part of the film lastly this was emotional for batman film which liked maybe the coming of age growing up aspect that this film brought as well as patts performance would have loved to see bit more gore and blood but that is just personal preference is still gritty just not gory1.0\tit been days since ve watch this movie and can stop thinking about it it very different from all the others batman before you can love it or hate but it certainly is something the shots and the colors are amazing there was lots of hype for this movie and in my opinion it did not disappoint robert pattison and zoë kravitz chemistry is amazing totally loved them his batman it more darker his perfect for this role hope to see more of this batman in the future three hours are lot but it definitely is worth watching it1.0\tno spoilers don think this is bad film just don think it is great batman film this movie would be great batman comic book but it isn great movie have to give this film second watch to start off with the positives this movie had amazing visuals was completely stunned in areas off it one critique have it that the camera should have been more dynamic instead of just pans and static shots my first issue is with the characters the relationships between the characters aren reinforced even with dialogue there are also barely any character arcs we never truly learn about the relationship between batman and commissioner gordon they just work with each other there is no depth to their relationship another issue is with bruce and alfred with the exception of one or two scenes we barely learn off their relationship selina kyle is very 2d character and personally didn card about her at all the riddler was an awesome character had couple issues with him though the mask hid the fantastic acting and you never understood his motive until the very end another issue had with this film was batman himself he did not fight like batman he barely used any gadgets he fought too raw and rarely used the darkness and shadows to his advantage yes understand this is his 2nd year bruce wayne also just acted like an emo teenager even saying the line you re not my dad the ending was very anticlimactic nobody truly won there were also no character arcs like stated previously batman didn grow as hero due to this experience nor did anyone there also weren any epic shots of batman on top of building or whatsoever that is more of personal issue though have more issues on the topics such as the story structure the story going to fast character motivation and more the visuals and acting carried this film it would be better comic book than film not bad but not good1.0\tthe batman is practically flawless film pattinson just might be the most appropriate batman of all time he was perfect it was dark it was suspenseful very noir as intended kravitz is probably my personal favorite catwoman of all time as well it was incredible will definitely be watching it again0.0\tcould not watch even hour of this piece of the background music is the worst and doesn even complement the action in the foreground want my batman to be larger than life with lot of wow like ironman and other superheros for realism ll pick movies from sundance really can understand why producers have this uncontrollable desire to humanize batman and keep creating ts like this again and again1.0\tstop making boring movies in the name of good movies the dark knight was also good movie but it will never bore you love matt reeves previous movie like apes cloverfield but didn get bore in those movies the batman was too slow0.0\tthink they are trying to take batman character backwards with this movie he is overly sensitive to everything will cry in every scene if he could and also his action scenes felt bit underwhelming if you compare this to the dark knight movies story seemed stretched and has few good moments but overall very boring for batman fan who wanted lot more1.0\thave never seen batman movie like this not the portrayal but the story its perfect kind of like sin city vibe batman as detective makes him more interesting than being just superhero everything about this movie is very grounded and very close to real world its definitely long but never lets you get bored so no complaint there all the performances are great and the cinematography is awesome definite watch for comic book fans cos it absolutely feels like chapter right out of book1.0\tamazing story line amazing characters and plot the cinematic and the photography was amazing in this movie the way it was directed and everything just goes to show how much pattinson worked his ass off1.0\twhat an amazing scenery this movie is littrely masterpiece robert pattinson as new batman has done great obviously new cat woman is also amazing the best duo ever fighting against crime the gotham hero has risen and it time for gotham to change finally hero has risen new bruce wayne has risen it time to reboot dc universe1.0\tmatt reeves has done an incredible job with the batman movie that can be considered masterpiece that feel will get better with multiple viewings this hour journey passes by quickly as each scene gives us clue that leads up to another the world greatest detective finally has movie to show for it movie that focuses on that aspect and is elevated with the presence of paul dano riddler we get dark grounded take on all the characters and that feels fitting for them all we have stellar cast robert pattinson believe will be the best batman in few years zoë kravitz had such good take on catwoman loved the chemistry between them and would like to see more of her in this role jeffrey wright is great fit for gordon colin farrell completely transformed for this role and was one of the best in the movie can wait to see more of him as the penguin it was nice seeing john turturro we get different take on alfred with andy serkis we don see much of him but enjoyed what saw would like to see more down the line paul dano masterful performance taking character that was over the top and giving us this terrifying horror like character is sight to see the cinematography and the soundtrack are both truly wonderful the attention to detail gives us joy to watch and to hear am very excited to see more of this take on the batman note the hours pass by nicely the first two hours went by in the blink of an eye but it was slightly underwhelming last hour1.0\tlook if you prefer your batman as camp crusader pow wham whack this movie is not for you ve always thought of patterson as blonde boring vampire and did raise an eyebrow when heard he was the new batman however he does an amazing job paul dano one of my favourite actors does what he does best the director does great job of making gotham the best rendition of the city we have ever seen in the whole batman franchise using liverpool famous buildings and areas within the city in the process dark cold wet and believably creepy characters and with the movies score that plays throughout the whole movie all mixes in phenomenal way definitely must see1.0\tbatman dceu really needed this after the underwhelmingness of batman or bruce wayne in the josstice league and batman vs superman this was needed brilliant characters and amazing villains top tier acting from all of the actors admit felt weird after seeing pattinson cast but he was amazing was feeling underwhelmed by recent hollywood productions but this has somewhat restored my faith this movie didn feel too slow everything was fast paced and worthy of its almost hour movie time excited for the spin offs and sequels as always with good movie1.0\tfantastic dark and thrilling adaptation finally show casing the dark knight detective prowess reeves masterfully pulls the strings of stellar cast lead by pattinson with great performances by catwoman penguin falcone gordan and alfred even the city of gotham is brought to life in unique way that feels like you are watching another character on screen will go and see it again soon and highly recommend1.0\tthis is what live action adaptation of comic book looks like the dark parts of the gotham which were supposed to feel dark felt dark the characters who needed time proper development and certain depth they got it the protagonists had that sense of nocturnal life which they were supposed portray this movie does not focus on the whole action packed sequence and rather on the detective side of the batman michael giacchino score tops the whole movie and gives batman his first theme music matt reeves direction confirms that this his one of his favorite project to work on you can tell batman narrating his intro is one of the major highlight of this movie that felt like true adaptation point1.0\tno words can properly describe my experience watching the batman from being lifelong batfan to seeing them film this in chicago and to finally see this on the big screen is surreal could not stop smiling for the entire hours literally cried shooting tears because of how fulfilling this film this masterpiece is can wait to see what next1.0\tmatt reeves has exceeded the expectations by giving the fans what they needed the batman is no doubt the best batman adaptation on silver screen yet with excellent performances by the cast beautiful cinematography extraordinary background music has made magical blend its been 36 hours have seen the movie but can still feel the gotham experience while watching the movie person will feel that he she is sitting in gotham all the credit goes to the director for painting such an art can wait to see more of the batman verse with sequels and spin offs1.0\tpattinson really made his job well along with all other characters impressing visual effects and cinematography are worth pointing out they have done well on having approximate similarities with the books only downside to me was the length felt it could be around 20 min shorter they could summarize the end little more would be awesome if they explore other anti heroes in the next one apart from the joker1.0\ttried to think of something in this movie that could make me give it 10 but it just not there could find no faults with this movie smart script well written well acted beautifully filmed edited and dark grisly depressed view of gotham so serious so weighty batman feels powerful gadgets feel real the fights bring some creativity and the direction is superb love the script and the music especially the ballad pumping three note batman theme this was an awesome movie to see in the theater honestly wasn that excited when saw the original trailers but boy am glad saw this hands down an epic movie long and beefy felt like it was kind of exhausting overall but too enjoyable to complain loved the direction and momentum above all well done on all levels do yourself favor and see this is theaters1.0\tthis to me was the batman movie to get gotham and the caped crusader himself most right incredible movie until the final act which falls short overall great movie1.0\thad watched the movie in imax theatre and its just too stunned than the other movies that released on same theatre the making of the movie juz nailed it robert pattinson as batman is really amazing im personally not dc enthusiastic but this movie really acceleratese sooo much1.0\tlove seeing batman beat up goons but this is the first live action movie that really shows you he detective too albeit rough detective but that fair considering he barely starting his second year as the caped crusader this movie also gives us great version of the riddler in my book anyway classic batman bad guy who was bit too goofy in batman forever this riddler still brings the ham but he also such creep that even if he weren criminal you wouldn be inviting him to party anytime soon unfortunately there isn very much of the contrasting bruce wayne persona whether he batman the prince of gotham or master bruce he pretty much the same guy but that not what bothered me because hey bruce is damaged and like emo characters what did bother me is alfred getting somewhat shafted you get the idea that he cares about bruce and that he fairly smart but you don necessarily care about him even if you do love andy serkis it also seems like bruce is going to have to deal with something really serious that changes his feelings about certain someone but then it turns out nah that was lie and he gets over it fairly quickly so that was kind of an unnecessary detour all that said however this movie has fantastic acting great action an intriguing mystery magnificent looking gotham and the best batman suit ever don me if sequel is in the works seeing it no question0.0\tpeople are saying it is pure detective movie but didn find any good detective scene only unnecessary word games which even kid can play and batman was walking like dead man or robot hours of movie is too much better read books intead of wasting time in this movie1.0\tdidn know what to expect may have approached it with bit of batman fatigue asking do we really need another batman franchise when it began thought they are very deliberately pacing this very slow jeffrey wright delivery was especially telling because familiar with his work and the cadence of his speech then began to watch for other deliberate choices music colour choices lighting the sparse presence of bruce wayne slowly began to believe the characters the city the decay the ominous gloom until ultimately realized this was unique and powerful adaptation of the batman source material with rich depths was totally won over the casting is great the performances are anchored the soundtrack is perfectly evocative give this film 10 masterful out of 10 superhero drama1.0\trobert pattinson gives career defining performance as the batman perhaps the best batman yet his dark and grungy take on the billionaire playboy keeps you invested for the whole almost hour runtime paul dano also gives the perfect riddler performance with his take on batman villain being up there with heath ledger joker0.0\tknew nothing would come close to christopher nolan but this isn even on the same planet pretentious pretentious pretentious it like kid with tons of money that just left art school decided to make movie the storyline has been done so many times there is no character development story doesn flow full of slow motion moments and build ups to nothing with the music from star wars was expecting darth vador to pop up at any moment it was soooooo bad they tried to make it arty and looking like the comic and if executed correctly the visual could ve worked but they got lost in upclose slow motion shots of not exaggerating of everything mug lamppost wheel of the car such massive fiasco so pretentious1.0\treally enjoyed this film saw it in imax and the sound design along with the visuals were amazing was shaking in my seat from the vibration when the batmobile was revealed the casting for the batman was great all around everyone in the film was excellently casted and was amazing in their respective roles ve always wanted detective focused batman movie and boy did matt reeves deliver have been fan of his since cloverfield and more recently the last apes film the dark tone was immediate noted from the opening scene to the very last my only gripe about the movie is that some scenes seem to drag on for beat or two too long it would ve had better pace if it was trimmed down to about 30 45 hours also do we really need another joker this would make it different iterations in the past few years the batman ip is loaded with so many great villain to choose from it would be great to see mr freeze or poison ivy on the big screens again in my opinion overall very enjoyable batman movie and would love to see it in theaters again0.0\tone star for pattinson excellent clint eastwood impersonation one star for wonderful footstep sound effects every 30 seconds and one star for paul dano who really like no more stars because it was really dull1.0\tfrom lifelong batman enthusiast my adult kid it the best batman of all the batman movies this is how batman should be agree it it doesn negate the trilogy this film is humanizing glimpse of our beloved crusader an accessible bat scaling down and up of his plight in the big city his personal battles public relations and an appreciation of gotham itself as it own character worth saving it one of the few if only movies immediately want to see twice with few words every moment is packed with purpose expectations were high tried and this delivered can bare to look at the ratings here so put piece of tape over my phone lol can any movie be 10 flawless idk it as ten as 10 gets imo truly hope it rated well enough and doesn deter from sequel please be sequel it stands in its own having had very tough act to follow the casting abs delivery is excellent dc slow and steady is winning the race if there is one0.0\tlong and boring batman is poorly cast supposedly detective story but he terrible detective and figures nothing out unless it told to him epic disappointment kravitz is good batmobile is cool cinematography is excellent movie is just poor it that simple anyone saying otherwise is just too insistent on their prior defense of pattinson casting to be objective1.0\tevery scene which included batman seemed so original and real the best ones were the batman with wing suit scene and the batmobile chase scene the ending was also great think matt reeves has done fabulous job overall with music and cinematography as well now looking for sequel for this movie0.0\tthat hours ll never get back slow the sold out cinema sighed and shuffled restlessly as the pace and story moved at snails pace by the end everyone was both relieved and exhausted the plot was boring the finale was flat the bat mobile uninteresting the riddler pretentiously confusing how on earth has movie got such high rating before release perhaps this was an unedited version as 90mins belongs on the cutting room floor stick to an extended trailer1.0\tten years after the conclusion of nolan batman trilogy matt reeves and his capable team of on off screen technicians comes up with thrilling neo noir version of the caped crusader that essentially detective movie pattinson rendering of batman bruce wayne is basically that of wealthy brooding recluse whose sole ambition is to make gotham more livable city matt reeves and peter craig structure the film in the fashion of slow burn serial killer thriller with batman playing the role of an investigator and vigilante with vengeance and riddler being the hysterical but resolute antagonist as lover of procedurals wholly enjoyed how the film brought several plot points and characters together into gripping concoction like different kinds of beads on thread apart from the screenplay two aspects warrant all the accolades they can get first of all greig fraser cinematography captures gotham mostly from wayne perspective but it honestly thing of beauty also the color grading is some of the best ve ever seen almost every wide angle shot makes for dazzling wallpaper and don mean it simply in glossy way the visual palette suits the material to adding subtle layers to gotham and its crime infested streets secondly michael giacchino stirring piano heavy score is just what this twisted crime thriller needs to say it does its job of adding to the emotional connotations of almost every scene would be an understatement solid performances are aplenty in the batman while pattinson work is the film spine paul dano riddler and zoë kravitz catwoman are equally if not more stellar commendable work has also been put in by the likes of colin farrell who unrecognizable as the penguin jeffrey wright gordon andy serkis alfred and john turturro falcone almost everyone has mentioned how the batman reminds you of captivating procedurals such as se7en zodiac and saw that because it feels less like superhero flick and more like gritty grounded thriller with well rounded characters the less reliance on gadgetry and the lack of long bombastic set pieces may irk few longtime batman fanatics but this film doesn need them in the first place it great piece of art that needs to be relished at the cinema halls people1.0\tprobably the best and most grounded take on the batman ever reeves directs masterfully pattinson portrays batman flawlessly his presence is heavy in every scene the dp delivers the best looking batman movie ever no spoilers this is just great film from every aspect1.0\tve got to be honest with myself here because wanted nothing more than to absolutely love this movie especially after reading all these raving reviews however felt the movies pacing was slow and spent exorbitant amounts of time with sub plots that weren really necessary the action sequences we re superb and to see an unpolished still trying to figure things out type of batman was also really fun to watch enjoyed this movie but to compare it to dark knight in terms of batman films will always leave you anticipating more of jaw dropping theatrical experience something this film doesn live up to1.0\tthis film has combination of aspects that are very safe but also smart to do the atmosphere of gotham is character in its self it seems it is adapted from the highly successful batman arkham video game series which is smart direction of how this major project aesthetically should look feel it was successful for the video game series why not bring it to the screen so gotham actually feels like gotham in this film this batman version of this series finally drives itself from the detective comics he is finally on film working along gpd as whole the film is very captivating the writing is well done inviting the audience to follow batman to figure out the riddler next move involves you to think it is why this film is extremely successful across many generations of movie goers which makes the run time not factor films lack this aspect in writing story today the acting overall is great one disappointment is andy serkis cast as alfred my opinion is andy is far more menacing as villain his persona amplifies that character type andy deserves alot of screen time he lacked because of his characters roll catwoman was played well but has social justice activist motivation at times in the film her statements feel unwarranted in the film but zoe was sexy personable unlike dark knight rises dead pan anne hathaway penguin is always going to be shocker when you keep thinking that colin under there cool depiction riddler is questionable think not buying into him the same as didn buy into jesse eisenburg as lex luther of justice league the actor doesn fit the role to make you feel threatened commissioner gordon the same jeffrey write seems like he playing the exact same cia character felix in daniel craig james bond series although he is enjoyable throughout the film so it like dislike thing not love hate if you didn see the recent bond films you re all good batman well not sure of this version patterson fits but then he doesn would say he is combination of all the batman in gumbo pot but what new is the depressing portrayal of bruce wayne suicidal actions of fighting any villain while batman are over barring lacks major characteristic of batman that being an actual boogeyman of gotham there is no element of surprise to his tactics engaging any criminal or thug also begin kinda spoiler the amount of gun shots from pistols rifles automatic weapons batman absorbs is off the charts which gives the impression he superhero god huge negative if his life doesn feel like its in danger when you re in the 3rd act of the film end kinda spoiler the batman very pleased it has direction for the future so many aspects were thrown at you they all land no mystery the city of gotham the acting story the amount of characters involved really were played well to make this an enjoyable fun batman film very relived that dc took it serious their time to develop this film unlike justice league1.0\tthe movie was too long they could of cut some scenes and not missed anything straight up detective movie not really my type of superhero movie the cinematography and acting was ok problem with this movie is that its dark where as like fun super hero movies to me the dark knight is still the best batman movie1.0\tmost true to the comics batman movie yet pattinson is pitch perfect as the batman in demeanor mannerisms and presence gotham looks amazing the supporting cast is excellent across the board and the soundtrack is outstanding the story is intriguing and well paced despite what those with no attention spans have said 10 101.0\tsuperb performance from robert pattinson seems to rain lot in gotham but dig it action and darkness all in one know its short but simply cant say any more as love it love it love it1.0\tthis is solid movie some good action great cinematography terrific ambience and mood dark and gritty kravitz is as gorgeous as ever although why she is such great fighter etc is unexplained pattinson is solid when suited up he is anaemic as wayne felt the movie wasn really true to either heroes or villains and is more in the mode of the joker solid movie but not true to the comics also it is too long it definitely needed more aggressive editing anyhoo not bad but not great1.0\tpro time has not been kind to the pre christopher nolan batman films the campy silly action figure advertisements that were the tim burton and joel schumacher movies of the 90s albeit box office smashes in their time remain as unwatchable and misguided now as they were then bat suit nipples and mr freeze puns be damned it wasn until nolan 2005 aptly named batman begins that the era of good batman movies actually well began the property moved from strength to strength as the dark knight trilogy blossomed before giving way to 2019 joker jared leto umm interesting tenure as the joker hasn interacted with batman those are joker movies ben affleck interim stint as the caped crusader while embedded in not so great films has been pretty serviceable the lack of fanfare can be attributed to poor scripts and the dceu shoddy attempts to emulate marvel affleck brings gruff stoicism to the role that done the character justice the movies not so much which brings us to the batman ahh the batman add another hash mark to the growing list of great batman films of the 21st century and another embarrassing blow to their childish forebears robert pattinson vibrates intensity here his casting is pitch perfect as the morose furious bruce wayne only years into the gig as gotham resident crimefighter simply put he bad motherf ker in bad king mood and it makes sense he still relatively new at this and it isn exactly working out early on in the film he remarks that years after donning the suit crime has only risen in gotham so often we are shown bruce wayne who is becoming batman it nice to see bruce wayne who is struggling with being batman it an arc we haven seen until now and it makes for fresh drama as for the production design those who praised todd phillips joker for its gritty grimy tableau will find plenty to feast on matt reeves gotham is right in step with the filthy grubby new york vibes of nolan and phillips what nice surprise is that pattinson batman actually does some detective work this time around while there was some sleuthing in nolan films pattinson brings batman back to the gumshoe bruce wayne of the comics he sussing out clues clocking hidden traces following up leads pattinson is the rare actor that can be equally good in indie arthouse films and hollywood blockbusters in fact it was his performance in the criminally under seen good time that first put him on reeves radar for the role his chemistry with andy serkis alfred is natural and believable they pull off the surrogate father son dynamic well serkis himself does well as does zoe kravitz catwoman paul dano riddler colin farrell penguin and jeffrey wright commissioner gordon the audio visual production is also worthy of note the sound design is especially affecting the punches and gunshots in this film really pop it maximizes their impact and sells the action the lighting is also doing good work in the background here the use of light and shadow lending just enough comic book flavor while keeping things appropriately dark when not veiled in shadow many of the scenes are bathed in an eerie red light that permeates the atmosphere it an arresting visual choice that only increases the immersion into this dystopian gotham con all this to say the movie is not without its flaws for one pattinson batman takes few too many bullets and one point blank explosion to be walking away from even for batman in the batsuit he should have at least been laid up in the hospital after several of these action scenes the movie is also overly long it doesn drag and keeps things moving the whole time which is testament to the editing but at hours there is simply too much movie here it almost feels like director cut that was theatrically released what curious is that for such long movie alfred gets relatively little screen time serkis makes it count but he shouldn have had to squeeze performance in with 180 minutes to watch perhaps some time from the extensive car chase involving batman and the penguin could have been better spent on that batman here also interacts with commissioner gordon and the police much more publicly than in previous films it an odd unspoken occurrence that goes unexplained as batman himself is wanted criminal vigilante certainly the police would be required even if they themselves didn want to to arrest him if only for the fact that the public is aware of his open presence amongst them the film also suffers from common flaw of most superhero movies which is that the plot is needlessly convoluted there your villain your sub villain your main henchman your secondary henchmen your misdirects your first climax your final climax it all bit much to juggle the movie also suffers from flaw more specific to the batman series as whole the premise that the blight of current day cities is organized mafia crime this relic of batman 1939 comic debut has stuck around for almost every film the simple truth is that as grounded as this film is the assertion that organized hierarchical mob controlled crime is the big menace in modern day american cities just doesn hold up anymore whatever weight that threat held in the american psyche faded by the close of the 90s along with the mafia it time for the batman character to shed this outdated notion that fat well dressed middle aged italian men in suits are lurking in the alleys waiting to mug you perhaps batman films should pivot to period pieces if they re going to cling to this obsolete view everything else in the batman films have been successfully updated to the 21st century it time this tired trope get the treatment as well even 2019 joker fell partial victim to this when arthur fletch was beaten and assaulted on the subway almost to death his assailants were dun dun dunnnnnn rich wall street guys in suits get it insert eye roll here which brings us to point of some contention surrounding this film upon release there was small but fierce clamor accusing this movie of being woke propaganda and while this reviewer certainly wouldn go so far as to support that claim there is scene where catwoman literally refers to the antagonists as white privileged holes whatever your political allegiances certainly that not so much on the nose as it slams twitter brick right up it if nothing else it firmly dates this movie to 2022 and breaks immersion it doubtful something so of its era can age gracefully bottom line robert pattinson and company add another outstanding entry to the batman canon the gritty punchy ride through thrillingly nightmarish gotham will keep you invested even through all hours we could use little more time to get to know alfred and some of the faulty notions underpinning the batman property as whole surface here as well but this smart brooding take is worthy of spot amongst this century already excellent lineup of caped crusaders out of 10 stars1.0\tthis film captures the character and his world so flawlessly the acting directing cinematography sound design set design special effects all spectacular it hard to compare this to the nolan trilogy but will say if you are big fan of batman lore then this may take the edge over other iterations1.0\tthere were so many fantastic glimpses into what this movie could have been the main problem was the runtime way too long this could have been sliced down to hours and have had much more of an impact it also suffers from way too many moving pieces three villains four if you count one behind the scenes penguin would have rivaled joker if he had been given the center stage but instead we had too many plot points too many gotham harbingers and complete lack of focus on the entire story does robert make good batman he makes great batman but wasn given the proper dialogue or story to work with during given sporadic scenes he outshined all his batman predecessors there no doubt would have preferred this to be bad movie that we could all just write off but instead we got film that tried continue nolan legacy but came up way short sliding into 1st base there definitely promise for sequel but the creative team really needs to tighten things up1.0\tgranted when this movie was first announced and it was robert pattinson that was set to portray batman bruce wayne have to say that wasn exactly thrilled but having seen pattinson in the 2019 movie the lighthouse will admit that things were definitely brightening up for this 2022 batman project however given me not being overly keen on superhero movies as per se then the batman was not movie that rushed out to watch in the cinema home viewing of the movie would suffice and now having seen what writers matt reeves and peter craig brought to the screen will say that this 2022 movie from director matt reeves was actually rather enjoyable and yeah robert pattinson definitely put on great performance and carried the mantle of the caped crusader more than sufficiently he was actually rather good in the role and it is great to see how the sparkling days of twilight are just thing in the past the storyline in the batman was good and entertaining with contents of crime drama and good old fashioned action so the batman has something for just about everyone in the audience and it definitely felt like movie that was at its rightful place in the dc universe was certainly entertained by this 2022 movie the movie also has great cast ensemble robert pattinson definitely was nice in the movie which pretty much ended me perceiving him as sparkly teen heartthrob zoë kravitz was quite good in the role of selina kyle catwoman and with the likes of jeffrey wright colin farrell paul dano john turturro andy serkis and peter sarsgaard on the cast list then you are in for quite treat was really surprised to find out that it was colin farrell whom portrayed oz the penguin because he was fully and wholly unrecognizable something just doesn understand is why they opted to put jeffrey wright in the role as lt james gordon visually then the batman was good and it definitely spruced up the movie experience quite lot while the batmobile was interesting it was strange design for it as it deviated very much from previous renderings of the vehicle wasn particularly much fan of the costume that they opted to give to catwoman as it wasn really something capturing the essence of the character from the comic books and then there was the costume of the riddler let not even go there it was just downright laughable was genuinely entertained by the batman and is it movie that is well worth investing almost hours into my rating of the batman lands on seven out of ten stars1.0\tthe movie is everything man really love it think this might be the greatest batman movie ever made in this decade thank you matt reeves for giving us the fans for such great and amazing movie1.0\tbit too morbid but overall fine movie still unsure about pattinson but thats mainly because of the high standard set by ben affleck just kidding you know who im talking about1.0\tim batman fanatic ive seen everything batman related when it comes to the movies animated shows and movies mulitple times robert plays batman basically for the entire movie which is different from other batman alfred and bruce are in the movie for 10 15 minutes tops serkis is decent for the amount of screen time he had same goes for ferrell as penguin tho still believe devito nailed penguin 30 years ago maybe that will change with his tv series on hbo max wright as jim gordon was really good my breakout in the movie if im being honest zoe as catwoman was well done up there with the other ladies paul dano as riddler is different and interesting his take on role and the way it is written played on screen gives me jigsaw vibes with hints of psycho keoghan as joker is different his laugh is unique just like all of the others am open to see what he ll do in the role just like am with seeing full take of jared leto joker as it goes for the movie this is crime thriller detective more than superhero film you seet batman and gordon work practically hand in hand through out the entire movie which is cool to see bc it really hasnt been done in batman film before the tech in the movie is dope to say the least the car chase scene in the movie was solid but heath and bale was better the action we did have in the movie was put together nicely the fighting style reminds me alot of bale affleck still has better scenes imo music was good imo different from others unique liked it overall its solid batman film when it comes to other batman films dont include afflecks even tho he has played the role in multiple movies he has never had stand alone film some might say bvs is batman film but it isnt until he has his chance ill compare this to the likes of clooney kilmer keatons bale and west to me dark knight and batman returns is better this can slide in to 3rd or 4th interchange that with batman89 or begins even like forever out of 10 could easily wait to stream it like did with that being said sequel to this universe and take on batman with be cool to see looks like will see court of owls in film as well as joker most likely harvey dent as well probably as assistant da obviously penguin and harley quinn will be involed if joker is in the mix which we see already an could even see madhatter being involved since reeves is open to any villains this might be the route he takes clayface would be unique take as well if they choose to go cgi1.0\tthis is great batman film in its own right and should not be judged alongside the dark knight because the two are different although the characters are the same this batman is closer to the dc comic depiction of crime solving detective batman definitely worth the watch would highly recommend1.0\twow best batman movie for many many reasons batman is like the comcis is focusing on the investigation and police work and gotham vibes is so dark and cool greate characters like batman and cat women and even penguin1.0\tthis movie was like looking at mirror and seeing something else director matt reeves captures detective type batman unlike ben affleck or christian bales batman this movie has more fist fights than any other batman film action stunts cuts and story makes this movie even better true 10 10 by me0.0\tcould of easily cut off an hour from this movie from the damn walking and glances that don end the story was good but nearly fell asleep in the cinema or decided to leave let me tell you have policy to watch movie to the end but this really pushed it with how slow it moved wasn the only one you could hear group sighs as the movie still went on when half way through you thought it was done0.0\tthe most boring superhero movie from dc no just the most boring super hero movie worst making dead slow story worst action sequences no moments in the overall movie batman in the worst writing1.0\tit is said that all of the license plates seen on cars in the film are illinois plates in fact they re not they are actually plates for the fictional gotham although they resemble illinois plates the gotham plates that were created by film makers were made to look like illinois plates just in case some slipped through in background shots during filming in chicago1.0\tthe batman movie delivers in every way storyline is great and the villains are really good was skeptical about robert pattinson taking over as batman but gotta admit he did great job batman is the perfect character to feature in the dc universe movies dc decided to go more into the dark and serious tone years ago and the batman fits that theme perfectly he dark brooding and quite frankly just doesn take any crap this movie pulls it off perfectly great job dc on this one1.0\tve been looking forward to this movie since 2019 and my gosh it exceeded my expectations it everything wanted in batman movie and more very happy with the result can wait to see what they do next1.0\tthe movie is dark fun and kept me engrossed till the very end the atmosphere in the movie is what liked the most it felt more gotham ish than nolan trilogy or the recent joker movie hope all batman movies in the future stay like this and never introduce all those gods and supernatural beings now that every superhero movie is trying to stuff their stories with such things just non descript dark shadow and five minute bloody fist brawl in the batman movie sends more shivers down the spine than half an hour cgi battle in say the new spiderman movie but was disappointed after the villain reveal moment the motivation and the villain performance were too weak in my opinion but that didn stop me from enjoying the rest of the movie because gotham and batman created in this movie are that riveting1.0\tsecond only to the dark knight this is an outstanding contribution to cinema and batman on screen set in gritty realistic gotham with beautiful cinematography and an outstandingly written screenplay matt reeves the batman is our first taste of the caped crusader detective skills it not without action either some of which topping nolan efforts paul dano riddler is something straight out of david fincher worse nightmare as the film takes influences from seven and even saw at times it superbly cast with colin farrell as particular highlight and robert pattinson is impressive as the most insular and strangest bruce wayne batman yet at approximately three hours in length it tad too long and delightful as it is the last 15 minutes could have mostly been cut that said any batman fan would be happy to sit through the whole film as it promises to lead to quite the sequel must watch for any batman fan and movie goers who like psychological thrillers0.0\tcons my biggest problem with the movie is the horrible miscast for every major character especially alfred who is barely in the movie feels lost and falcone doesn feel intimidating the movie could be edited to remove atleast 40 50 minutes and nothing would change some scenes were stretched for too long and some just had boring dialogues that kept on repeating the plot isn very great or new there are many movies out there like this this one just has costumed guy the payoff at the end wasn worth the hour buildup they wanted to keep things in real world but sometimes they don follow it two people take close range blasts and survive batman walking close to cops and getting photographed his biggest thing is his secret identity like who wouldn recognise him also on other note it is also not movie made for theatres too many flashing lights and rest is pitch black1.0\treally only had two problems with this movie and docked it star for each my biggest complaint is robert pattinson in the title role while thought his batman was fine his bruce wayne was complete fail this has proved to me once again how easy it is to be the bat but you have to have range to be the man behind the mask my other issue was the length have sat through hour movies and thought that couldn have been that long but this felt even longer at times think that goes to the bruce wayne scenes being so badly acted when batman was on the screen things moved quickly but the scenes of wayne seemed to drag along1.0\tused to read the batman comics since was young and the picture that always had is that batman is the detective among the justice league heroes like the previous batman movie series but for me something was missing this batman installment brought what was missing in my humble opinion and enjoyed seeing batman working as the detective alongside com jim gordon didn feel the hours almost passing as the film plot was laid quite intelligently rob pattinson added value to the role and jeffrey wright was as awesome as usual if you want to watch this movie forget about the all action all gadgets batman and embrace the detective batman you ll enjoy it lot1.0\tjust wow no need to say anything more go ahead and watch it now loved the darker tone the fight scenes were amazing and with the soundtrack combined this will definitely be remembered as masterpiece1.0\tthe action the dialogues acting cinematography just wow and the suspence and riddles of the movie keeps engaged to the movie till the end riddlers riddles the solving skills of batman bow down almost no use of vfx cgi nothhing pure cinema1.0\tan amazing movie the film balances tension horror with riddler action and investigative films in an incredible way from director matt reeves alongside michael giacchino incredible suspenseful soundtrack and perfect performances detail to robert pattinson bruce batman who delivers everything just like his castmates best batman movie and one of the best heroes1.0\tbest comic accurate batman you ll see in live action movie just watch it and enjoy the dialogue cinematography and action is perfect hope you get the same experience as did0.0\tthe first hour is so boring almost fell asleep everything seemed too dark and too slow the movie run time should be cut in half or sped up like 3x times1.0\tfirst of all the cast is amazing everyone thought why robert and now all of them see why he great actor the movie is scary like thriller love it and it so dark and creepy how gotham is supposed to be gotham is sick place and was portrayed perfectly people say the movie is too long but think it perfect because then get to enjoy the movie even more and let not forget the riddler he riddles he costume and he voice are so scary love it go as far as to say that this might just be the best movie of 2022 and if you don enjoy it there is something wrong with you0.0\tthink at one point during this interminably long movie we forgot we were watching it just keeps going on with the same stuff that worked years ago when it was new and somewhat interesting doubling up on the pointless and constant whispering when there no reason to whisper the world seemingly without single visible source of light freakish bad guys insulting ledger legacy made worse because they forgot to include any hint at all about how the riddler could have possibly funded such an extravagant long term plot to annihilate an entire city0.0\t10 what is wrong with people this movie is massively overrated boring dialogue weak storyline doesn even come close the the dark knight trilogy movie quality seems to be getting worse and worse don trust these bogus movie reviews save your money1.0\tit not the best batman movie ever that still is the dark knight but this is an impressive and thrilling superhero neo noir that really surpasses the hype and the hype was already big the batman lasts three hours but you don notice the time it sleek dark terrifying sexy disturbing and surprising at times pattinson is an excellent batman and solid bruce wayne catwoman is talented scene stealer penguin is pure fun gordon is good and the riddler manages to get under your skin the rest of characters move the plot forward nicely matt reeves direction is zodiac seven style and the music is gold one of the best batman movies ever made and movie that demands to be experienced on the biggest of screens1.0\tthis new version offered much darker aspects of batman and gotham city pattinson definitely melted himself into the batman figure and succeeded in reshaping the detective we all know really wanted to see evil parts of cat woman and her savage part but the film only displays the emotional part of her personality feel like it needed more depth not too much since the story is about batman the film score was absolutely incredible lots of percussion mystery atmosphere it definitely played huge part in the plot camera angles were precise however some scenes were too stretched in scope the film did not need hours period its also good to not have forced comedy like most superhero films do currently1.0\tthe batman serves as more of horror noir superhero film dipping it toe into something fresh within 5he superhero world am proud to say that all the hype and expectations have created have been exceeded by this exemplary thriller robert pattinson demonstrated the life he bought into this role effeciently the film overall is crafted with pinpoint accuracy with matt reeves in the directors chair his direction of the film allows us to immerse ourselves into batman shoes and view the world according to him zoe kravitz also takes the spotlight with her supporting role as catwoman unquestionably one of the most exciting cinematic experiences ve had in while it absolutely safe to label the batman as one of my favourite superhero films along with the dark knight this spellbinding and gripping thriller is movie for the ages1.0\tthis move made what would normally say is boring batman plot into an actually entertaining and thoughtful film it kept some of the traditional qualities as well as some newer qualities of batman that people love and added lot of additional flavor and complexed nuance to the mix to make great premise mix in some of peoples favorites villains and leave out the most obnoxious ones and you have what is pretty much the best you can get for batman movie most of the actors really shine and give an honestly amazing performance in this film would definitely recommend0.0\tbatman the musical relentless noise to hide an absence of certain something aside from pattinson whom despite looking the part has next to no script ends up basically being paramedic in fancy dress suffers horribly because of it the films writing is so hollow the riddler spends his time trying to be nolan joker which didn mind but just goes to show how lazy the character construction is characters are superficial empty quite frankly halfwits detective gordon is shown to be an imbecile who without batman can solve nothing have to say the weakest of nolan was batman begins which was still incredible far far far superior to this drivel this isn good movie it looks ok that ok but nolan still looks better it the best part of 20 years older pattinson should ve backed out from this wrong time to make batman movie with studio that is also intent on being woke this is what you get sorry state of affairs really awful1.0\thave like three issues with it the chase scene is little hard to follow the third act isn as strong as the rest of the film and there scene at the end that felt unnecessary but still giving it ten why because this is the kind of batman movie ve been waiting for my whole life it dark and realistic but also stylish and large scale it not limited by commitment to realism like the dark knight trilogy nor is it burdened by shared universe like the dceu it is its own thing moody disturbing visually stunning david fincher inspired three hour long detective epic with some of the best interpretations of the characters ever put on screen robert pattinson is fantastic as younger moodier and yes more emo batman paul dano is straight up terrifying as the riddler colin farrell is unrecognisable in more ways than one as the penguin and zoë kravitz is easily my favorite live action catwoman this movie kept me hooked all the way through even if said before the third act is its weakest part but that like saying that the cone is the worst part of an ice cream cone it true but it still delicious this is the best batman movie the dark knight is good and all but reeves finds the perfect mix of gritty realism and style nolan would never even dare to have snorricam shot of batmam gliding over the city and finally gives us live action batman that lives up to the title of world greatest detective not that there much competition since he like the only one to actually do any actual detective work no christian bale magically finding fingerprint on broken bullet doesn count0.0\tdo not like trashing someone hard work especially when it does not have some weird political or social agenda baked into the plot also do not read comics and only know batman from the original tv show think because live in nyc this was just reminder of what dump this city has turned into run by sociopaths and drug dealing hypocritical politicians the movie had no humor or wit just angry greedy vengeful and evil people can turn on the news and see that anytime wish the only exciting character thought was zoë catwoman they should have found director with bit of joy and hope in them and made nice underdog move with her character is the director or producer of this nyc documentary going through traumatic divorce or deep clinical depression why make such long depressing movie1.0\tlike many felt conflicted after watching the batman it movie that many will appreciate more during their second viewing when expectations are out of the way it great movie but it rarely feels like superhero movie it more of high stakes story driven crime detective film where the batman shines brightest is its fun character portrayals the movie is chock full of fantastic performances the cast doesn hold anything back most notable is colin farrell the penguin jeffery wright james gordon and robert pattinson batman batman is one of the most beloved fictional characters in superhero history thanks to an intricate world and abundance of deep characters this batman film understands this and focuses in on these aspects these performances draw us in and keep us engaged which is good because the movie is light on action compared to other superhero flicks but that doesn mean it doesn have its exciting moments the appearance of the batmobile and the following car chase scene is exactly the kind of thing that gets my blood pumping it was nice reminder that this is indeed batman movie the potential here is massive the batman is great start to what may be an incredible superhero trilogy is it bit long it may feel like that but when you take into consideration that it doing some good work setting up this planned trilogy the runtime is totally acceptable while love creative and epic superhero action sequences it nice to see this movie showing off batman intelligence and detective skills it strange seeing such young and slightly clumsy version of this character but that makes it unique and refreshing look forward to seeing batman growth over the course of this trilogy0.0\twhat boring movie to make specially for batman no story no suspense no comedy and all this for almost hours we were just waiting for the movie to be over1.0\tlet talk about the story it just wow amazing don know again it was very different with other heroes movie so that why like this movie it unpredictable not like what you think like the other heroes movie that get super power then villain comes up and kill down the villain with super action this movie doesn have much action but detective mystery really love the sound mixing it so cool the acting of course think there politic issue in this movie like bribing money to politicians and that was really happening in real life ok now let talk about the visual it so god damn good pretty beautiful was like open my mouth when the beautiful visual and cinematography comes up cat woman in this batman movie was so fire amazing pretty cool and it kinda brutal for pg 13 don know what to reviews again but all can say is this movie was amazing all in this movie amazing you guys should watch this movie in the biggest screen you can1.0\tthe batman the new movie was not only scary but really epic and herioc in an amazing way some of the scenes surprised me in good way and the fight scenes are just as awesome as any other superhero movie the movie also got me more excited for the new sonic movie that coming out next month the casts who worked so hard on the movie totally deserves reward but now know it not just call it warning1.0\tif you re going to be nearly hours long you better earn it this film doesn can count on one hand the number of films around or above the three hour mark which actually deserve to be that long good script is must good direction and good acting of course perhaps the most important thing though is purpose beyond pure profit can find that here we ve already seen all the shades batman film can take we had campy over the top comic book lite batman with the late 80s and 90s batman films we had the comic books are super serious sfx laden batman saves the world snyder films of last decade most importantly we ve also had the gritty realistic and complicated batman seen in chris nolan brilliant dark knight trilogy there literally no good reason for this film to exist yes pattinson is better batman than ever realised he could be yes the script is decent and so is the direction too if the dark knight trilogy didn exist this film could perhaps be heralded as the start of an interesting new direction for the batman franchise but the dark knight trilogy does exist and is superior to this in every way film doesn get to be this self indulgent without very good reason this film simply doesn have one1.0\tgreat batman in noir sin city style without the explicit violence robert does great bat somewhere in the middle of the long movie the story wasnt interesting enough to be catchy to me something felt off with the story writing1.0\tstory 10 pacing 10 score 10 cinematography imagery 10 lead acting 10 supporting acting 10 sound design editing 10 10 set design 10 costume design 10 this film did not meet my expectations because of the poor pacing and story but it is still worth seeing in theatres for the sound design and imagery alone1.0\tthink the batman is very well told and interesting movie we are introduced to very emo bruce wayne which resembled zero year batman new 52 when bruce didn really care about being bruce wayne only batman and clearly is very young batman it was well paced and didn feel the hours the universe has lot of potential0.0\tam big fan of burton and nolan batman but this batman was too dark too depressing and far too violent this movie is only for adults not teenagers there are scenes that will give you pain in your stomach if you are bit sensitive the whole movie is super depressing there is no chemistry at all between batman and the catwoman apart from being two creatures who are both depressed sad and angry the whole movie this movie is too childish for adults and too violent for kids pg 13 this movie should be too violent went to see it with my son he 13 and although we had great time we were horrified by the psycho violent scenes point for the music superb point for the art production and point for the cast 101.0\tno words can describe how good the cinematography plot acting and everything is matt reaves is truley genius for this robber pattisons acting as the batman was twisted dark and majestic while riddler one was creepy and evil hats off to the team dcfandome1.0\tthis is by far the most significant comic book adaptation since the dark knight matt reeves delivers master mind noir filled with darkness and emotion batman still is the most important and interesting comic book caracter in the history of cinema1.0\tafter watching highly anticipated movie both personally and by the public left the theatre with slight disappointment the batman had its highs and lows was aware that this movie received more or less polarizing reviews and it sad to say that am on the negative side more let talk about the good things first if dark knight was reimagination of batman by nolan the batman felt like straight up reincarnation of the comics even though have never read the comics could still tell that they were going for that sort of vibe based on some interesting cinematography they had one of the opening shot was shot through the cracks of ceiling giving it an effect of someone spying on the mayor and the general atmosphere very dark and gritty and the music choice mostly string arrangements with very little to no percussion significantly differing from modern blockbuster movies the main theme being repeated with different arrangements also reminded me of old animated tv shows which don claim that am familiar with appreciated this because understood that they had mountain of legacy to overcome and they chose to do that by adapting completely new style of batman that is truer to the original also want to praise the gotham they created it actually felt very in line with the gotham shown in joker but even darker and more atmospheric also loved the fact that this batman was more or less new to the job and without the aid of high tech equipment like the one we see in dark knight further aligning the film with the comics actually found pattinson batman fine and have no criticism it is slightly too early to tell how it will compare to past batmans because it trilogy but have high hopes for him but there were some downsides first did not think this movie needed catwoman at all couldn understand her purpose finding her friend was what drove her but it really hard for the audience to care about that purpose because we are hardly shown the friend or her relationship with selena if we just edited out the scenes with selena the movie would have shortened its running time by 30 min another one of its downfalls and made the narrative clearer didn mind that there was basically no explanation of the character background and got straight into it but can imagine there would have been some confusion with the relationship between batman and catwoman its romantic undertone was present the entire time but the audience is never given chance to get into that because it was half cooked and the audience was expected to have preconceived notions about their relationship also didn think zoe kravitz performance was very convincing it felt little out of touch with the rest of the film for some reason while felt that while paul dano performance as riddler was great the appearance of him and his supporters was underwhelming like bunch of zodiac killers walking around did like the detective film genre combined with crime noir the movie has created like the storyline further exploring citywide corruption which haven seen in lot of batman movies in lot of ways imagine the tv show gotham would be good prequel to all this but alas find that show slightly boring feel that it really fair to take look at this film again when all of the trilogy is out dark knight was the 2nd film after all all in all the batman gives fresh take on reviving the comics version of batman but there are some downfalls that exist within0.0\tlike any dark knight fan knew pattinson was the worst choice in the world from the second he was cast and can believe let all the fake hype make me slightly optimistic best can figure all the bs hype is being created by tons of money and all of pattinson old psychotic sparkly vampire fans coming out of the woodwork to support his only real movie since1.0\tthe batman 2022 directed by matt reeves is everything wanted it to be and more dark suspenseful gritty slow burn intense crime thriller that has the energy of the fincher masterpieces se7en and zodiac the first riddler appearance sets perfectly well the atmosphere and tone of the movie and that the moment the audience almost instantly realizes that this is something different something deeply disturbing hazy dingy comic book movie that will make our hearts skip beat or two and not firework show fan serviced theme park super hero flick reeves gives one of the best characters of all time batman the very much needed neo noir story that he deserved and couldn be more satisfied the amount of praise that this man needs for his directorial effort on the batman is absurd robert pattinson was as expected good portrayed an emo reserved mourning young bruce wayne and mysterious ghastly brutal and vengeful batman like it was nothing zoe kravitz was phenomenal my favorite portrayal of the catwoman in the big screens sexy empowered hypnotizing and agile selina kyle the chemistry between the two of them was great and the sexual tension was most of the times little too much to bear but got no problem with that the batman presents us with lot of mind blowing fighting sequences and has some of the most beautifully choreographed and well edited action scenes off all the comic book films ve watched the cinematography is memorable epic and immersive greig fraser did brilliant job am already recreating some of the shots repeatedly in my head the score is amazing perfectly timed mind blowing and matched the giant spectacle that the batman was every single technical aspect of this movie is on point gotham is as beautifully eerie as painfully grimy it also my favorite portrayal of gotham city in all the masked vigilante movies dano riddler is also incredibly scary and unpredictable and seemed like fair opponent to the batguy batman and ridller interactions were haunting and chilling the batman isn perfect it far from that however it the flawed masterpiece genre redefining batman movie that we needed loved every second of it and can wait to watch it again and again and again also can stress enough the fact that if this is the movie equivalent to batman begins does that means that there is matt reeves and robert pattison the dark knight to come1.0\thad to write review for this one was so hyped for this movie the day heard about it seeing it in imax was the best movie experience ve ever had pattinson portrayed bruce wayne so well the dark cinematography was beautiful as well even though it has run time of nearly hours it didn feel too long highly recommend this film to anyone1.0\tyezzirrr is one of the best movies ever have seen this more than time and continue to thing that is as good as it was at the first view and it wasn just the hype it worths every minute of viewing1.0\tthe batman is an outstanding and nuanced movie that gets all the big things right and is hard to fault in good faith nonetheless it not without few minor but noteworthy defects cinematography 10 first off never thought say batman movie could be too dark but honestly this was literally darker than 1998 dark city at times was straining my eyes in the theatre such was the intentional dimly lit appearance of the film get it this is gritty noir laden crime ridden neon saturated gotham city not the sweet beaming pleasantries of the shire but still do actually rather want to see gotham city in the literal sense that my eyes aren equipped with night vision of course that not to say there undoubtedly need for dark and dingy aesthetic in such movie which goes hand in hand with the tone of the franchise and especially the gritty claustrophobia of the doom fraught gothic metropolis in which it is set the desolate aura of the picture is unceasing though perhaps overpowering from the outset and don get me wrong it does work for the most part yet can help but conclude little more contrast and vibrance here and there in the odd scene instead of muddy murky look particularly during shots of the night city would have fleshed out the cityscape and provided somewhat of an interlude in between those dark bleak interior shots in summary not convinced the picture needed to be this dark for that quantity of run time cinematically speaking what is not shown more of in the picture was also slight gripe for me for example grander exhibit of the gotham itself which frankly seemed like bit of an oversight when compared with other core facets of the movie think exposition time as alluded to very large parts of the movie are filmed in indoor settings with heavy use of medium to close range shots which is not to detract from their effectiveness the movie wasn entirely without the odd wide angle shot and brief showcase of the city though but the image was so dark sometimes lost that don recall gotham city ever being conveyed in single memorable shot then again concede perhaps this is owed to the director vision that this gotham is far more often felt breathing down your neck than it is necessary explicitly shown as an aside all other special effects and cgi were entirely seamless score 10 10 the score was certainly my favourite feature of the movie and can praise it enough more so the especially subtle atmospheric background music that haunts many scene in fitting bat hanging fashion amidst those shadowy investigatory and often cramped choked settings exactly as batman movie should feel this is musical score which adds so much to the overall theme of the movie that it assuredly presents itself as the musical manifestation of the batman himself sound 10 but boy oh boy was the sound mixing off let me start by saying am young adult who is not hard of hearing but around 20 of the dialogue was missed because of how low and muttered the spoken voice is in this movie to the extent that was straining my ears in at least couple of scenes the sound producers in hollywood really do need to get their act together generally so appreciate this is part of broader problem that has been plaguing the industry for some decades now mind you perhaps ever since the digital revolution given there is heavy reliance on mood driven dialogue for at least 60 of the feature runtime the movie really ought to have forced subtitles if you want to catch every detail of the story seriously casting 10 was instantly won over by robert pattinson who masterfully portrays young batman bruce wayne he looked felt moved and sounded like the dark knight with the exception of the bulk sub category or perhaps it the suit assortment that gives batman more buffed broader and bulked up appearance in hindsight casting was solid though there wasn necessarily single stand out performance beyond the lead himself who have no hesitation in saying might just be the best actor to play the part owing to very impressive charisma and command of the role pattinson treated the role with admiration care and respect and in doing so gained my respect nothing too fancy or ott from him just raw authenticity in terms of the bat alter ego again nothing overly dramatic cool calm and collected and ultimately likeable young bruce wayne thought all supporting actors exhibited jointly credible and adequate performances action 10 just right wonderfully choreographed pretty much no filler nothing that felt needlessly over the top the combat in the first third of the movie was expertly executed the nightclub scene for example was genuinely one of the greatest combat scenes ve witnessed on screen batman intro into the movie gave me chills preceded by that ice cold opening narrative personally ve seen more memorable epic car chases than the main batmobile which would ve been nice to have seen bit more of scene though admittedly not massive fan of fast paced highly edited quick cut sequences the slow burn moments are where the magic of the movie lies for me which is why was all the more impressed by the action in this film in that it was equally as satisfying to watch as the calmer moments plot 10 enthralling mysterious haunting intriguing never dull moment even the slow burn scenes draw in their audience and leave them wanting more pacing feels just right thanks in most part to the main antagonist who keeps the movie flowing under an ever present cryptic malevolence acts and for me are where the soul of the film is nonetheless the final act is very satisfying the only half flat moment if had to pick one being the end scene itself which seemed slightly on the lukewarm for my liking even so the ending to its credit certainly left me anticipating more the political elements of the plot fit in perfectly and build tension from the outset there are couple of sub plots revolving around corruption which feed into the main story and serve to only increase the mystery and suspense aided continually by that hair raising score conclusion 10 rounded to gripping and impactful piece of filmmaking not since 1995 se7en has movie claimed the best award for atmosphere as does 2022 the batman near perfect first instalment in what looks set to become an untouchable series don think this movie can be sincerely compared to nolan dark knight trilogy the overall structure tone aesthetic and director vision of matt reeve sthe batman is so different from nolan vision that find it peculiarly difficult to compare the two both have their strengths and setbacks though the latter ultimately loses by way of being one of the most overrated movies of all time1.0\tjust loved it just watched it in theatre pattinson is great young batman battered vulnerable bruce compared to our bale sauve bruce the background score is different than the previous ones dc you rock1.0\tfinally we are getting this masterpiece after so much waiting it not like and ordinary superhero movie where we get to see hero fighting with villain it much more basic thrilling and dynamic the fight scenes are mind blowing the plot and the robert pattinson is just so versatile and mind blowing the best batman movie1.0\t10 matt reaves really had to make an unique and great batman film to stand out he succeeded with it being very noir driven and an emphasis on batman detective work sure it might be little long and takes while to get going robert patterson proves himself to be an awesome batman zoe kravitz paul dano jeffrey wright and an unrecognizable colin farrell are great additions also the music is awesome the action scenes are exhilarating the acting is great the tone is fantastically gritty and the cinematography is on point die hard batman fans shouldn mind the near hour runtime it was fantastic to watch and definitely warrants some repeat viewings not as good as the nolan trilogy as expected but it an admirable effort0.0\twelcome to the woke batman 2022 it all about political symbolism in this one one again has come to try and conquer the dark knight and failed miserably1.0\treally well crafted movie that delves into the detective aspect of batman this is real life version of the arkham games that comes pops on screen in imax every character in this movie serves purpose and make it feel like any member of the rogues gallery can fit seamlessly into this world the title says it all this is the complete opposite of the dark knight rises where that movie is 80 bruce wayne and 20 batman really worth seeing good action really well done murder mystery and now in my top batman movies1.0\twhere the first burton and schumacher batman movies were borderline fantasy cartoonesque nolan batman was more grounded in action with larger than life villains this new version however is much more gritty thriller detective focussing much more on developing batman even when it bruce wayne who takes the stage and even though robert pattinson may not be the best bruce wayne ever he is the best batman ever mimicking tom hardy skill to steal the show only with part of his face and being parallel to paul dano riddler who like batman is just as much hero as he is still damaged kid can wait to see more of this batman1.0\toverall thebatman is solid and different take on an origin story that gives sin city meets scandal meets spiral meets the energy of halloween michael myers there are many who find themselves going back and forth about which batman film is the best or is better but am someone who honesty feels that every batman film has been great batman film for the era it was released in in other words wouldn call any batman film bad or disappointing yeah have my faves but there are none that totally despised or would say is better than another they ve all delivered for different reasons related to the year it was released in 2022 especially while existing in this pandemic we are constantly in conversation about the issues and concerns we have with our government offices as people we are having more conversations about mental and emotional health dealing with trauma and unpacking our relationships and past with possible toxic parents families and this batman installment mixes all of those things together in its traditional batman formula but because it doesn give what many enjoyed from christopher nolan that huge blockbuster batman feel that is the reason why across the board would promote this film as interesting enough to watch oh also shout out to our natural hair black political queen welovetoseeit and the post credits moment is so petty and hilarious highlights first just gotta give paul dano his props my goodness you don really get into appreciating him until act three but my goodness mean it was simply the eyes while his head was on the diner counter that grabbed me next really enjoyed zoë as catwoman she brought everything that millennial embodying catwoman would bring on screen for me also the introduction of the bat mobile if that wasn the coolest moment without being lot was smiling so hard when it was revealed pattinson expressions while in the mask were also very telling for both him as batman and the issues he deals with as bruce and lastly just the overall thematic development and follow through especially through batman himself could ve been better the writing could ve definitely been much stronger for batman pattinson many of his lines sounded like the script for batman video game also would ve loved more focus on the relationship between batman and alfred to help really give that one moment between them more fuel to bruce overall development1.0\twatched this last night thought it was excellent batman doing what he is master of being detective no silly costume clad super villains no massive cgi no ridiculous super powers to fit the storyline just realistic gritty dark seven esque detective story that brings you into the pain and awkwardness of bruce wayne and his alter ego this is no marvel type film this is batman in his rawness still learning how to be the bat can wait for the next installment hopefully set around year this is year1.0\tpersonally have no experience with batman havent even watched the nolan movies just have general idea of the guy through pop culture this iteration however was defeniteley my cup of tea it was dark noir thriller and it leaned heavilly towoards classic crime movies it was slowburn and it presented thick and wellcrafted plot the visuals as well as the music and the general art direction were spectacular peter pattison once again proved his acting chops overall lot of thought and dedication went into this and it shows now to some negatives first of all the journal entries narrattion was bit too cheesy for my taste while the ending was bit over the top in my opinion on top of that think it could have been cut to and half hours rather than all these didnt really doom the movie but they certainly left sour aftertaste to my experience0.0\tfirst of all it very bad movie why well it is very simple as at no time do we enter the batman universe nolan gave us demonstration that city could be character the acting is pitiful we don believe it for single second this film is too long and at the same time it is too short because the plot is slow to arrive and the way it is treated is not worthy of batman in addition to all this imposture he does not forget the woke side yes we are subject to it to white man privileges literally this movie is disgrace to dc comics and its fans everything looks wrong and cheap what makes the batman are his enemies and here they are so lamentable that batman himself becomes lamentable what they gave us was wrong1.0\twasn massive fan of the dark knight era batman so when this was announced with cedric diggory as batman my hopes weren that high but have to say it was great film the batman back story was well done and the film never felt like almost hours worth the only character wasn entirely convinced by was the riddler but everything else was pretty much spot on it reminded me in parts of the fantastic gotham tv series character and story wise which can only be good thing1.0\tit bleak return to gotham with new moodier batman with reeves in the directors chair this was always going to be good film but as feared this is return to nolan aestethic if you ve seen batman begins se7en and any decent mob movie well here they are altogether in one film is that bad thing not sure acting wise everyone brings their game pattinson is decent batman but his introduction would have had more heft had they not shown it in the bloody trailer ll also mention that battinson is literally the most grounded batman on film that guy didn fly across rooftops at all don think more catwoman all day long zoe kravitz owned it dano as riddler excelsior wright gordon not commissioner yet is good too and think this is the most time we ve spent with the character farrell does good turn as oswald cobblepot very enjoyable but he bit player here and not very penguiny overall it solid out of 10 for me ll definitely rewatch at some point but all the chatter about not seeing batman like this is bit of fallacy okay basically someone put batman in seven and ran with it also don bother with waiting for credits stinger seconds of disappointment1.0\tit must be said that the new batman movie titled the batman is quite excellent some say the movie is as good as the taste of its director you might have wonderful group of filmmakers collaborating in their respective fields but if director doesn have vision behind his concept the film might feel disjointed and fragmented matt reeves created magically complex version of gotham city resembling modern day new york the production design and props have this fantastic analog feel to it which adds to all around gloomy atmosphere it must be said that this version of dark crusader is very much inspired by movie seven with flashes of fight club looming in act in way the batman is movie of half first part is very character driven where characters are shot in close up and medium close up which enhances the drama they go through also the coverage of the action scenes is often shot up close which makes us feel like you are in the middle of the carnage the cinematography is beautiful shot with fantastic anamorphic lenses often putting things in foreground with background all defused with wonderful bocca effect all the performances are very good and the chemistry between very endearing zoë kravitz catwoman and robert pattinson batman is very intense the finale doesn disappoint with large scale of filmmaking there can be parallel made between nolan dark knight where joker and batman although are two separate polarities of light and dark forces in reality work together to clean up gotham city from crime syndicates joker does it covertly by infiltration of crime families and in the end taking over the dark side some say nolan depiction of joker as ptsd army veteran which wants to get rid of corruption in the city by being the agent of chaos has clear commonality with relationship between ridder and batman in the end the batman 55 minute blockbuster is everything we tend to love about big budget hollywood movies although more character driven then most productions coming from tinsel town this depiction of cape crusader is more darker grounded and almost have feel of character driven crime thriller which just happens to include epic scope which leaves the viewer wanting more judging by the ending there are more movies planed highly recommended0.0\twatched this movie with lot of expectations pattinsons acting was not upto mark overall not satisfied with the content and direction going to watch the dark knight and dark knight rises again to get batman feeling0.0\trobert performance or relatability with the character or with the previous actors was nowhere close to their excellence how can people create wonders if they make such silly mistakes in casting colin appearance was classic though0.0\tboring slept twice watching it gave up after hours repetitive storyline depressing bruce wayne batman uniform is the worst ever quite impressed people managed to watch to the end1.0\tthe treatment the batman undergoes dark gritty and neo noir atmosphere to the entire extended of the whole movie the tone really sets the true gothams cape crusader within the story1.0\tso very dark three very long hours of darkness after hours everybody in the theatre was checking the phone texting pattinson was great in the role very convincing as very tormented bruce cat woman was good too for them is otherwise would be am sorry have paid the ticket and seen the movie could spend my time better than watching three hours of darkness1.0\twas taken back by this movie bit would not consider myself to be huge fan of anything dc or marvel for that matter ve seen most of these movies typcally only once several things about this movie impressed me for instance it felt more believable than most movies in the genre didn feel batman gadgets cars and other were over the top furthermore really nothing had that over the top feeling catwoman was played brilliantly again her persona seem real and down to earth same with the riddler brillaintly played like other batman movies it had that element of darkness however really felt this version took it to another level which reminded me of the joker movie the darkness felt authentic and even creepy at times the movie may not be the most action packed but this rendition really didn need to be kudos for taking risk and doing something bit different also like that it wasn about trying to jam as many mega movie stars into the movie this is not necessary as with other movies in this genre you sometimes feel like they are trying to out do each other great soundtrack as well definately will see this movie again which is saying something0.0\tam not being bias towards against robert pattinson or anyone else involved in this film this is my neutral take as dc marvel and cinematography fan in general first off the film is so long and so slow that it just makes you want to turn it off at some points too many scenes are dragged out for utterly no reason the plot is shallow and riddled with nonsense second there are way too many twilight like scenes and robert pattinson portrays far too emotionally available batman in my opinion his voice is also way too soft it does not convey the pain and scars of real batman the fight scenes are deplorable he gets away with things mostly out of luck car pursuit neck bomb explosion point blank shotgun to the chest all these scenes portrayed batman skills third why oh why is it so depressing haha batman is supposed to be dark and filled with anger sorrow not be depressed man child lastly useless and ridiculous alfred you re butler mate if you hear the phone ringing you re not going to go pick it up absurd1.0\tfirst damn matt reeves did some research on this batman you can this is real batman no superhero not any thing just detective but this time with twist depressed detective if you are going to watch it thinking its like christoper nolen series so don go its totally different this batman have different in many ways character casting is too awesome every on just fit perfectly and catwoman and riddler gives oscar perfomance1.0\thave to say first that this movie is not better than the dark knight but it is certainly in the top tier of batman movies in fact it may be second to the dark knight loved the take on batman in this movie and pattinson was so much better than expected ve seen lot of reviews where people complain about the length of the movie but don get it anytime you get to watch about three hours of batman how could that be an issue no one complained about the nolan films being that long overall this is great movie with great story that keeps you engaged from beginning to end plan to see it again in theaters1.0\tthe batman is dark psychological thriller that creates pretty similar atmosphere like the dark knight trilogy this is the atmosphere personally want to see from batman movie and of comic superhero movie in generell the darkness and rawness missed in venom got here tonight nice actors especially paul dano an interesting story and antagonists great pictures with all the black and red elements pairing with smoke and rain it more about gotham and thrilling detective crime story neo noir which is very nice and new for comic movie especially in contrast to the mcu unfortunately the movie is bit too long in my opinion and got some dragged minutes throughout the nearly hours because of that but that isn too bad and doesn effect the movie much in negative way and it even has the potential to mature and get even better in the future excited to rewatch it1.0\twhether you watch for the cinematics the music the underlying social critique or anything else you will have plenty to explore the color palette is just amazing and the story compelling enough to make you think about its themes even after the movie kinda miss michael caine as alfred but nonetheless all actors do really good job0.0\totherwise it overly long and dull typically avoid superhero stuff these days all cgi and no content just hour rollercoaster well this isn even that it aims high for style points but doesn quite make it due to the boring script and lackluster everything else stick to adam west1.0\tlove the way gotham city being portrayed so corrupt sinister and dark not very high technology batman but it the most realistic one this batman is more like detective than superhero0.0\thave read about the lack of origniality of story telling in hollywood well this film is perfect example of that there is no story here it is as flat as pancake the final hour is wasted the only high point in the film is the car chase chris nolans batman trilogy is still the gold standard of batman films and tim burtons batman is an excellent stand alone treatment this one gets lost along the way the film is just flat everything feels forced nothing to grab me or male me care about anyone or anything in this version stop already with batman sure the actors phoned in their roles which is sad such great cast and no heart1.0\tthe new batman movie is quite of treat for us comic book or for that matter anyone for movie as long as this one being hours and 56 minutes the pacing for this was executed nearly perfectly did not feel any boredom while watching the movie as there was always something going on keeping the audience watching the screen with interest their take on characters was done greatly one of the movies many strong points was the fact how the new movie was unlike any other batman movie we have ever seen relying more on the horror side and darker side of the batman not only do you get amazing fight scenes with great choreography but you get amazing even stunning cinematography the movie is simply stunning mix of original interesting takes on the characters great fighting scenes and overall beautiful movie1.0\tthe batman 2022 movie review batman probably the most realistic and humane kind superhero we ever know michael keaton batman was superior for its time but sadly the next films in the franchise couldn live up to the hype the god wanted this superhero to get the cinematic version and so came master christopher nolan lengendary trilogy that changed the superhero genre forever batman begins 2005 introduced the knight in proper manners and then the dark knight 2008 scored the highest merits for any superhero film in the world cinema tdk still remains unbeaten even by its sequel and firmly believe it will remain the best forever dc may have lost the box office battle to marvel but quality wise this one film or to lesser extent the entire nolan trilogy will always keep them higher than the mcu what nolan did was perfect plan we all grew up with the story he first told us the story of how bruce wayne became batman and then brought his trump card joker he lost heath ledger before the dark knight rises but still managed to end the trilogy on fulfilling note with matt reeves there is no backdrop for batman it starts off like settled film already and entirely focuses on the new journey of batman more as batman than bruce wayne it super dark film not just the shades but the whole structure and cinematic graphics too the batman is set after two years of fighting crime and sees batman uncover corruption in gotham city while pursuing the riddler dano serial killer who targets gotham elite he learns many unknown facts about the so called honest cops and even about his own father which leaves him eagerly devastated until he starts questioning his own indentity it almost three hour long film and still doesn have many action scenes or too many conflicts the film has few old fashioned cliches that might irritate you for while but otherwise it has plenty of new things to offer robert pattinson as bruce wayne hasn got anything to impress you but as batman holy smoke he is new form of vengeance the predictability of his characters causes reduction in the overall impact but the remaining results are still more than satisfying would have loved to see him in one or two iconic scenes and the film really missed it remember that beneath quote from batman begins or joker can win kind of scene from the dark knight or something along the lines of the joker 2019 evil bloodshed smile batman lacks it the catwoman without proper mask is big problem but zoe kravitz intensity and maverick style cover the loss paul dano as reddler starts looking impressive by the end jeffrey wright as gordon is fully convinced from the first scene and andy serkis alfred goes half baked the presence of john turturro is quite surprise here perhaps because no one expected such character the rest of the cast does decently well the batman has lot to offer in the technical departments because the theme is very unconvincing for the masses it takes you through dark world you have never seen before which subsequently becomes more absorbing the appealing use of the camera in brownish black mode the pulsing background score the intriguing set design and the long cut editing all contribute to the overall viewing experience matt reeves direction has few minor faults that appear almost throughout the narrative but still think that he done fine job the rest of the time long runtime gives you more chances to find mistakes and that makes the director job more difficult nevertheless reeves put up solid show out there this idea of batman fighting for his own existence and the mental face off between him and bruce introduces us to the rising story of gotham city dark knight the real change is here it little longer than expected but it is here finally overall one of the darkest soul spirited and most detailed takes on the coming book legend don miss it if you love dark and mystical experiences at the movies rating 10 by samthebestest1.0\tthere seems to be parallels between batman and spider man the dark knight and spider man trilogies of the 2000 redefined the superhero genre from its campy roots the snyderverse batman and marc webb spider man were the most polarizing then comes in tom holland spider man and robert pattinson batman who redefined the character once more for the better the batman is not just great superhero film but it also great detective film that doesn drag through it hour timespan everything from the aesthetics of gotham to the chemistry between the characters to the batman mythology in general feels exactly like the comic books from which the hero was conceived from robert pattinson iteration of batman dives deep into batman detective roots which was something felt was sorely lacking in previous films including the nolan trilogy1.0\tstory there is new villain in town of gotham who goes by the name riddler he victimizes people in power for being corrupt lives are taken away brutally will batman be able to stop this nuisance cinematography batman movies mostly are pictured in dark this one is no different the bat cave the bike the car the built in structures everything makes it spectacular direction with the inputs provided believe direction is superb final verdict this is not sequel to the movie joker this one is directed by matt reeves while the joker was directed by todd phillips both the movies portray no rocket science unlike those in nolan movies despite that these movies are scripted beautifully throwing light on words it not hard to make good movie1.0\tmatt reeves truly captures the grime and grittiness of gotham city not only setting the atmospheric level high throughout matt also kept the realism from start to finish from the wing suit to the batmobile itself continuing to never stray away from the films purpose which ultimately delivers product that all comic book fans can rejoice upon every actor and actress from the film held their own and gave us something fresh from their roles the stand out for me was batman himself pattinson is the real deal am somewhat sick of seeing people bash him for roles he had previously took upon himself his later stuff can easily justify any doubts any naysayers might have suggest watching this and go through pattinson portfolio before rating this0.0\tenjoyed all the other batman movies but this one is boring casting should of been done better for all the characters in this movie the storyline should of been better and not so dark felt so sleepy during watching this movie because it to long to dark and just doesn fit the batman universe time to make batman beyond movie enough with the same old batman storylines0.0\tgoing to agree with alot of what been written it was dark it was moody but on the whole it was too damn obvious and too long keaton and bale have done all this1.0\tdark gritty but fine return to form for the dark knight pattinson is an excellent fit yeah its long but its worth it the supporting cast are brilliant love the relationship between gordon and bats much closer than in previous outings1.0\tthis is brilliant film dark intense gritty and nothing like your run of the mill superhero movie in fact it is not superhero movie at all rather crime filled action noir with elements of horror pattinson portrayal of bruce wayne batman was hugely impressive full of rage anger and certain amount of vulnerability paul dano as the riddler makes for sinister and unhinged villain and steals the show add brilliant score and visuals and we left the cinema astonished feel you really have to see this on the big screen to get the full effect outstanding1.0\tit great time to be batman fan but this films reels you in with more while every adaptation tries to make their characters feel more grounded this story and its world brings you in closer robert pattinson was born for this role and brings whole new batman that only comic book fans know subtle and passionate performance that everyone will remember he officially moved on from twilight if that wasn clear yet paul dano as riddler was no surprise man did he bring it too matt reeves wrote and directed the hell out of this making this cold bleak city story have heart it no secret that this film is inspired by others like zodiac and seven but keeps its own identity and expands upon it also michael giacchino making another banger score not just great batman movie terrific movie with batman1.0\tmy opinion of the film is quite good even an unexpectedly well made batman film pretty good acting from robert pattinson as batman even much better than ben affleck and can miss paul dano best acting the riddle and zoe kravitz also performed well as catwoman the plot is well told and presented to the audience the film is slow as if it were moving in slow motion but this way you can understand the meaning and plot of the film my rating for the film is 10 because of the few action scenes0.0\tmichael keaton batman was the ultimate batman movie great actors great soundtrack great fun christian bale was ok but batman started to get realistic and boring robert patinson the batman is the darker of all but this batman could be an average detective with knowledge for martial arts the villains could star in an average thriller film cannot compare to jack nicholson dabby de vito or even arnold0.0\tbasically if you ve seen the trailer you ve seen all the good parts of this film the rest of it is lot of standing around talking about who dad is who and who dad did what not fan of any of matt reeves films really he loves long scenes of long conversations which are difficult to concentrate on but gradually advance the plot1.0\twent in doubter and came out convert lifelong batman fan of comics and movies and have to say this was great adaptation the noir tone the detective batman focus the cinematography soundtrack great villain performances the different batman many didn realize we needed never bought into the trailers came across as emo batman but not the nature of the film itself the tonal shifts within the film were well executed running through range of tones from dark noir through to hopeful and uplifting the blurry frantic action combat sequences work really well but this same style in the car chase detracted from what could have been the batmobile was epic though once again different and unique version loved the growing relationship between the main protagonists would love to see sequel1.0\tanother year another batman reboot this time being helmed by matt reeves the last planet of the apes films starring someone who knows bit about playing winged creature robert pattinson essentially frank miller year healthy dollop of david fincher seven the caped crusader or as my partner in the screening live action version of the murdoc the gorillaz character has to stop the emerged riddler from offing his list of supposed righteous figures the mayor the da etc who turn out to be as corrupt as the villains who run the city john turturro colin farrell helping pattinson in his quest are his loyal manservant alfred played by reeves go to guy andy serkis detective not yet commissioner gordon jeffrey wright selina kyle zoe kravitz reeves wisely grounds the narrative in the origins of the comic book where normal for the most part criminals rule the day the advent for the bizarre garish soon to be unleashed kept otherwise off screen for this outing pattinson has been doing his penance racking up impressive turns in smaller films working the likes of the safdie brothers david cronenberg claire denis much like christian bale before him to step into the black rubberized armor batting sorry an eyelash let hope the momentum quality remain in warner bros corner as future installments unfold1.0\tthe batman was easily my most anticipated movie of the year with its promises of grounded unique take on bruce wayne that became the incarnation of fear for criminals and one who cares very little for the everyday work of being billionaire philanthropist as matter of fact this bruce wayne straight up isn anything by day just rich man who was the son of the city god thomas wayne well this movie most certainly delivered on its promise but they also in the process showed me why it wasn great idea in the first place don get me wrong the film executed its concept perfectly on technical level no faults there the film is beautiful the actors do wonderful job and the practical effects are jaw dropping but the problem is that its story is highly convoluted with some connections that feel forced and would ve been best left to be two separate batman plots now on to the big question what about robert pattinson dark knight well pattinson does very good job with his material and shines as batman not so much as bruce wayne bruce wayne is very poorly written making him complete annoyance on screen he spends majority of his time out of the cowl with bad haircut looking moody and depressed which gets tiring at some point he also frequently disrespects alfred in very immature it not phase mom type attitude that bratty and frustrating to watch however he barely on screen as the man whereas he spends long time in costume as the bat oh my god his batman is terrific smart scary and brutal pattinson walked right off the pages of many celebrated batman comic stories reminding me of the caped crusader seen in batman the long halloween and batman serious house on serious earth as detective he is brilliant as fighter he is terrifying and in his softer moments with pitch perfect zoe kravitz selina kyle or during the end of the film deeply human person who is capable of being more than symbol of fear he can become symbol of hope now for paul dano riddler he is scary and unrecognizable in the role powerful enemy who is mentally ill but still genius his scenes are bone chilling and he prover in my opinion to be the perfect match for this incarnation of batman so have lot that love about this movie and enjoyed this movie tremendously the issues have with it are only very apparent if you take the time to think very deeply about the movie which several people may not want to do not trying to seem arrogant here just saying that it some very nitty gritty details highlighting here that aren apparent upon first viewing think that it succeeded on delivering its promise of being dark detective story but is little bit let down by its explosive and loud third act which falls prey to the usual flaws of big budget action movie which this film is most certainly not up till that point but anyway that my take hope you enjoy the movie yourself1.0\tdark dangerous deadly the batman slowly drags you in with moments of intense surprises throughout it long movie but never felt bored pattinson gives the best performance of his career the setting is dark but every bit setting fit for gotham very excited for any future sequels that hope follow this one0.0\tbasically hours of dramatic music and batman walking in slow mo none of the characters were likeable including batman lots of close up shots of rob pattinsons teeth not something my eyeballs enjoy looking at was bored in the first ten minutes and bored the entire way through the kid sitting next to me was more entertaining taking selfies of himself throughout the entire film tedious unnecessarily drawn out slow as hell and completely uninteresting storyline it was no dark knight have always been batman fan but this movie kind of ruined that for me if they make second one ll be saving my time and money by not going to see it1.0\tnot sure why people were skeptical of robert pattinson mainly citing twilight as if he hasn had some great roles in the last decade he delivered in to put that notion to rest good time the lighthouse etc he brought different perspective to batman much darker more moody take that worked very well in this movie it was refreshing take on batman after what they tried to do with affleck character the dark night trilogy set high standards and the batman seems to be setting up for another great trilogy and the direction it going in trumps it predecessor in the affleck take it has good blend of noir and the cinematography was the best ve seen in any batman movie the acting performances from robert zoe paul and colin were spectacular especially colin excited to see what to come in the future1.0\trealistic and masterpiece one of the best comicbook film script set pieces visual storytelling and performance was just perfectly done the movie was hours long and there is no dull moment you will just get hooked with the story trying to solve the mystery you will just want more and more love bale as batman but think its time to pass the throne to pattinson and also kravitz is the best live action catwoman period also please give paul dano an oscar that acting was nuts and matt reeves really made this movie very strong in every aspect very strong beginning would totally recommend it also pls dont wait for the credit scene there is no credit scene1.0\tthe batman weaves its plot through murders made by someone known as the riddler much love the film seven you are slowly uncovering an evil plan that plays out in spectacular fashion for me there wasn single moment where was bored the pacing is perfect and when there is action it is brilliantly handled and directed the score is memorable and when it accompanied by the visuals of this film which by far is what stuck out to me as the strongest element of the film it let you feel the dark underworld that surrounds you really immersive stuff with killer performances from everyone would recommend this as both superhero flick and an interesting and suspenseful thriller special shout out to colin farrell amazing penguin performance1.0\tspeechless easily the best cbm ve ever seen rob and zoe were perfect together and man this was like dream bruce batmans arc was beautiful note don expect this movie to be like your typical mcu movie1.0\tdark city dark secrets dark times next chapter in the batman series tells you what happen next in the gotham city robert pattinson is good choice to be man without any visible emotions liked that there is no action overdose what does liar do when he dead1.0\tthis is easily the best interpretation of the batman rob patinson does phenomenal job the anticipation was worth it don pay heed to some of the reviews they are mostly marvel fans who thrive on fake graphics and over the top stories0.0\tdon usually leave reviews but this was just such huge disappointment love pretty much all batman movies but this was just unbearable the movie tried so hard to be artsy and hip with its noir emo vibe but it was just too dark and depressing hated the convuluted dystopian universe with its clash of old and new technologies robert pattinson was just plain horrible the bat suit looked like halloween costume don know how one can like the dark knight and this because they re world apart it probably the first time ever slept in movie that how boring it was please go back to making enjoyable movies rather than artsy trash1.0\tthis new and refreshing take on the iconic batman is in my opinion perfect it portrays batman in way like the comics do somewhat darker and even more mysterious character this is what batman is all about although this movie was exciting mysterious and innovatory it not as good as the dark knight as some might say you could argue that this might be the best batman movie of all but certainly not the best batman movie what mean by that is that this movie portrayed the batman story better than any other movie did like in the comics still believe that the dark knight is the better movie because the movie itself was more structured and clear1.0\thmm everything just everything from story to screenplay from background music to cinematography and from casting to direction yes yes people this is truly epic masterpiece and freaking cinematic love you matt and michael0.0\twas not fan at all my biggest fear going in was pattinson as batman he did very well and my complaints aren with him at all his batman characters stinks however but he didn write it only acted it allow me to elaborate complaints below batman soft and weak it literally opens with batman asking if what he doing is even worth it if you re longtime batman fan you know that just not the character in any other form of media other movies included sure some villains make him wonder himself but not crime wave that he hears about on the news also this is kinda little but at one point he pushing table across floor and lets out an audible grunt this man swings through the city with grapple hook but can slide table literally weak in his portrayal not figuratively villains stink riddler feels like an edgy reddit user who you would never believe could pull of the elaborate plans he does definitely not cool witty riddler seems like theyre trying to show how dangerous the anon chan style websites are and it just feels so transparent and played out 2b the penguin and falcone are caricatures of old italian mobsters not believable at all these tony bolognas can get through sentence without ayyyy ohhh or something along those lines was just waiting for walking here genuinely had my friends and laughing at the theater old writers trying to play to young people at one point commissioner gordon says the riddler video has gone viral and then several scenes later they say in completely serious tone he got almost 500 followers clearly seems like someone trying to be modern when they re just not also catwoman white privilege mon another quote that had my friends and laughing in the theaters your political points in movie about an adult dressing up and punching people aren necessary remember when movies were great escapism this movie doesn lol and none of the political points are any different than the status quo you re not breaking ground or sharing some new age opinion please just stop to wrap it up the movie just isn good politics aside just don like the vision they were going for weak non confident sadboy batman again don blame this on pattinson as it was acted very well just horrible idea on the story telling side if you genuinely think this is remotely close to as good as the dark night you ve lost your marbles0.0\tyeah get the authentic storyline which leads many to be more hopeful than really appears much as the same following are about the last spiderman movie but by half way through it dawned on me too much pathos was going on and what was the point again really saw it dragging on all the way to the end even over focused on robert pattinson small mouth which really was pronounced wearing black cowling mask hiding rest of face maybe okay as vampire but batman and the batman maybe ben stiller had too much weight gain again1.0\trobert pattinson is in my personal opinion is the batman hands down the greatest actor who played bruce wayne at first was spectacle but after watching couldn believe how amazing he as batman can wait to see more of him think this is the second best batman movie after tdn and as beginning it better than tdnr so think what coming next will be like nothing we ve ever seen1.0\tmusic filming colours everything was spot on went with my girlfriend who isn big movie watcher and certainly not big fan of batman but even she was blown away pattinsson was amazing as batman like he was created for the role1.0\tfor character that has been revised and approached from other directions so many times before it is beyond impressive at how fresh the batman is subject to ridicule from it announcement and the danger of hiding in the shadow of nolan dark knight trilogy the batman is it own entity and pattinson is brilliant as someone not invested in his repertoire seeing the guy from twilight as batman early on was novelty but past roles are soon forgotten as pattinson encapsulates the grittiness of the character supported by the dark atmosphere and unhindered by flashy million dollar possessions strewn about quite uniquely for superhero film there is no brief moment of levity any scene no wisecrack or sideways glance the titular character moodiness prevails throughout only broken by rage and despair this may seem heavy and it is its the only way this plot keeps you engaged and engaging it is three hours is long for any film but the plot keeps you hooked by never falling on predictability there is always foreboding and tension but never clear moment when you know the villain next move it keeps it exciting and twists and turns are abound as the genre splits between gritty mob drama and noir detective thriller with flavour of psychological horror element being added by the riddler in retrospect there isn even an abundance of fighting plenty to keep you satisfied and to keep it an action film but emphasis falling more on plot and development the fight scenes are well utilised though far more realistic than the vast majority of superhero films and whilst there are still explosions and gadgets it still feels more grounded and personal the supporting cast perform just as well as pattinson with number of familiar faces moulded into variation of their comic book counterparts dialogue is clear and interesting and when dano is given the spotlight he fully takes advantage and excels for film shrouded in darkness everything is so visually clear which is refreshing things only obscured by the darkness when it is intentionally done so camera shots vary and keep angles interesting the soundtrack is one of the highlights though it makes the whole film feel relentless filling the gaps to always be building and reacting in turn hours flew by in the cinema it is not comparable to previous iterations of batman but standing alone it is nothing short of excellent1.0\thi just returned from the cinema wathced in imax environment all can say is just wow the music the effects the characters and coming together with totally different approach to batman great story with robert zoe and jeffrey all delivering great performances that make characters known so far through the years of batman movies very refreshing must see this one due to great effects audio is impressive go see it in cinema don wait for streaming release you won regret it1.0\tpattinson was absolutely outstanding his version of the batman will always remain unique very good story and amazing writing lot happens my favourite dc film unbeatable1.0\treinvention the action or process through which something is changed so much that it appears to be entirely new when was in college remember hearing someone say that new batman movie was being made asked who was going to be dawning the cowl and they replied christian bale thought the guy from little women and newsies what hadn seen him in american psycho or equilibrium at that point also had no clue who christopher nolan was even though had seen one of his films insomnia well needless to say my hesitation about bale and ignorance of nolan was put to rest within the first 10 mins of batman begins lol fast forward almost 20 yrs and here we are again yes another actor has portrayed batman since bale portrayed very well in fact something didn think say about affleck but he was really great however those movies weren only about batman with new batman movie and it really good nolan changed everything with the dark knight trilogy it was real gritty and not of the superhero super powered kind of world imo it will never be outdone that being said this is an almost complete reinvention of the character and gotham city nolan himself said that one of the best things about the batman character is the ability to reinvent himself for each new generation this movie is testament to that statement as it has been said to be this is really noir type of movie much of the focus is on batman as detective and his working dynamic with jim gordon focus is also put on his relationship with selina kyle aka catwoman batman year one has already been done many times so this is batman year two bruce is still working on being the batman still trying to figure out how to fight seedy underworld of gotham city and focusing on little else in his life he angry vengeful looking for fight our film starts out with mouth breather doing surveillance on the mayor home on halloween night after seeing the mayor wife and son leave to go trick or treating the mouth breather makes his way inside and kills the mayor with an unusual weapon afterwards he leaves note riddle for the batman bruce voice speaks as we see different parts of gotham city he talks about spending most of his waking hours patroling the streets in the darkness of night and that yrs of doing this has transformed him into kind of nocturnal animal he talks about having his own signal now that can be shined in the sky when he is needed how it not only signal but warning when it shines all the thugs and lowlifes in gotham run scared thinking he going to leap out at them from every dark corner don want to say too much cause feel like that would be giving the whole show away will say that this movie exceeded my expectations and they were pretty darn high robert pattinson played the caped crusader very well he was dark broody vengeful and not at all sparkly had to say it lol actually twilight fan guess you could say it my guilty pleasure andy serkis played alfred very well no big surprise there zoe kravitz is selina kyle personified so good paul dano brought so much in this portrayal of the riddler he serial killer kind of cross between the zodiac and john doe from seven he scary colin farrell was in this jk but if didn know it was him wouldn have been able to tell he was incredible john turturro plays his role very well also not funny at all many people will try to compare this to the dark knight trilogy and really don think it good idea to do that this is the same character but completely different setting story and say different universe the run time is long and it different those are the two things see that could deter viewers but really hope they don this movie is an solid rating imo thumb drive remember that lol after my 2nd viewing everything said before still stands true enjoyed it even more the 2nd time the first time went to see it was on opening night it was packed group of about 10 12 18ish yr old guys were sitting all around me and the one to my left reeked ugh stuck it out cause wanted to see the movie but it wasn pleasant 2nd viewing was much more pleasant as said before the dark knight trilogy will never be outdone imo however this movie is really good effort would describe it as different batman different universe kinda thing1.0\tthis is how 21st century batman should look like the riddle was such an amazing and realistic villain social media is as important in the movie as it is in real life1.0\tdo not want to hear thing not sentence not word not even breath from anyone who only knew robert pattinson as edward cullen before this came out and were petitioning for him to be recast also literally just got back from watching this at the release day midnight screening and it three hours long and tired so this is probably going to be much more rambling than most of my other reviews but since started with it let talk about robert pattinson he been one of my favourite actors for while now between good time tenet the lighthouse and the devil all the time he been consistently throwing out amazing performances since the last half of the 2010 and yet when tell people that he one of my favourite actors all too often get looks of surprise and remarks of that guy from twilight because wider audiences genuinely only know him as that guy from twilight well couldn be any happier that that guy from twilight has this role for one because now maybe won get made fun of for saying like him but mostly because he absolutely crushed it can certainly see people taking issue with the particular way he plays the character especially concerning the bruce wayne part of him but thought it was if not an entirely new take on batman at least one that hasn been seen in live action film before and even if you re not fan of certain things he does in or out of the suit would be incredibly surprised if any hardcore batman fans have nothing good to say about him and just happy for him really because now maybe he can shake his perception as sparkly cringey emo vampire and if so he definitely deserves it just like ve been saying he does for the last few years whether or not he better than michael keaton or christian bale well ll have to think about that because it has been hot minute since ve seen any of those films but from memory think he just might be and the rest of the casting spot on also zoe kravitz as catwoman well she doesn feel all that much like the original character which is shame but she did great job regardless paul dano as the riddler oh my god yes believable motivations slightly unique spin on the character is arguably morally better than batman just great villain for anyone who wanted more serious take on the riddler that never happened well it happened and it awesome jeffrey wright as gordon was great too even if he doesn have anywhere near the presence of any of the other major characters as was andy serkis as alfred and colin farrell as the penguin would have never in million years thought of him for the role but what do you know he was brilliant too and completely unrecognizable to boot but ve harped on about acting for while so the directing well no wouldn say this is as well directed as christopher nolan films but that is fairly high bar to set and think that matt reeves did really good job regardless there very deliberate sense of this being detective noir film over an action film and bloody loved that you do still get some great scenes of batman kicking ass but this more than any other live action batman really emphasizes the detective aspect of him the cinematography and lighting look great as well even if did feel as though it could have stood to be little bit more creative and concerning the film length it exactly as long as it needs to be so other than some slightly cringey dialogue and soundtrack that didn find myself noticing all that much maybe it really bland maybe just didn notice it don know don have much to complain about guess there was bit of missed opportunity to construct mystery surrounding bruce parents instead of just giving us all the information almost as soon as it suggested that there might be more to it than bruce is aware of but still thought the narrative was really great with an interesting take on all its characters so what the hell and also get the sense that it likely the most comic accurate live action adaptation to date as well so you ll probably be satisfied if you re fan of those in the end goddamn am happy this happened just as long as all stop treating robert pattinson like he was one hit wonder in one of the worst book series adaptations ever put on film1.0\tit just wasn that great in my opinion but definitely worth seeing close to masterpiece but not quite there very good acting the story was building up but haven reached its potential and lost its momentum bit out of focus and all over the place not but maybe bit more than0.0\tinteresting idea with the portrayal of batman as detective but the movie is definitely too long sometimes boring pattison is solid batman but his bruce wayne is terrible understand he still freshman still learning and traumatized so can probably forgive some imperfections but just hate his wayne in this movie bruce is like immature emo kid with stupid hair falling to the side sorry but it hard to take him seriously in this version plus for me when pattison takes off his mask he too boyish for wayne batman with the mask on and with his square jaw he is fine but the spell breaks when he takes it off then you see edward cullen not batman compared to the brilliant villains especially dano as riddler pattison looks rather bland add to this too long screentime boring sequences and almost no action and for me it disappointment1.0\tok this is really tough one on the one hand big fan of film noir and the slow narrative slowly developing characters and impressively staged photography which is why big fan of denis villeneuve but there point here where something went wrong the trailer suggested to us tough young avenger relentless retribution that gotham tries to beat with its own weapons what we got was miserably long dialogue film that simply doesn allow itself enough outliers in pacing and tone to remain interesting as an artsy film noir the film works very well though it too long for me for that as well as batman film unfortunately it works less it good movie but not good batman film0.0\trather have fork jammed in my eye than watch this movie again few scenes with good special effects did not make up for long hours of boring drama they talk slow walk slow it like they took hour movie and put it on half speed want refund0.0\tthe film presents only an escape from reality people seek in this film an escapism from their mediocre and monotonous lives as they cannot change their routine they only seek escapism and the need to believe that there will always be savior people need messiah to save them masterpieces revolutionary watch films by ingmar bergman tarkovsky stanley kubrick akira kurosawa1.0\tit tough one to review there are great things about this film the moody dark atmosphere throughout pattinson does surprisingly well in the role and the chemistry with cat woman was excellent the opening minutes are top notch and really set the scene for the darkness of what coming and that slow but constant psychological pressure continues throughout replacing much of the action scenes we re used to in batman the huge problem is though that at times in the second half of the film was simply bored there nothing wrong in theory with hour film dark knight for instance was 2h35 and that simply flew by the batman though is just too long for the content they had you could so easily have edited out 30 40mins and lost nothing really believe you should never be bored at the cinema it travesty and upon leaving the cinema that boredom was what remembered deliberately waited couple of days to review it and there is no doubt it good film but why oh why they had to drag it out so much ll never know overall worth watch less action than in previous batman films but compelling none the less some very good acting but just little too slow at times for my taste0.0\tthe story is not very good has it moments but fals poorly the acting is well maybe the manuscript gave them to little the effects are really liking from such big movie the fight scenes are not very impressive and lame too convenient things bout in action sequences and story vice the bad person won expose who is done in cool interesting way tho and acts good0.0\tlong time viewer of batman movies since the michael keaton days have seen all of them the joel schumacher batman films and the christian bale ones in conclusion stick to the tim burton batman movies they are the best just slightly inferior are the joel schumacher movies because the casting was just terrible and count the chris nolan movies the worst ones because they took all the comic book fun out of them and destroyed what tim burton had created as batman standard this movie does everything wrong bad actors bad acing bad direction even still the movie is almost three hours long and goes nowhere there are no special effects like the burton schumacher movies and are worse than the chris nolan films no wouldn recommend you wasting three hours of your precious life on this earth watching this horrid movie1.0\tone might think that after 14 incantations of the caped crusader on screen by various filmmakers what left more to explore the answer lies in matt reeves the batman very fresh comparatively and different take not only from other batflicks but from the superhero genre itself it would probably be wrong to call this superhero film because it is far away from it for me atleast the film is purebred neo noir detective horror thriller at it core it channels david fincheresque way of storytelling likes of zodiac se7en etc it has horror elements throughout genuinely scaring me and keeping me on my toes staring into the nooks and corners it seems certainly inspired from the criminal underbelly and politics of nolan bat trilogy the film is shot like piece of art and might get you into thinking am witnessing an art house film the neo noir style of filmmaking with superhero at centre reeks of freshness could have gone horribly wrong mind you if not executed to the but reeves manages to do it with aplomb the film is dark figuratively and literally as well the various shades of black makes the viewing experience tad bit difficult thank goodness there was no 3d version otherwise we would have been watching black screen for hours it dark moody subdued going around in its paces which is slow very slow it rarely bursts out characters talk in hushed tones there is no flamboyance feels like watching no nonsense detective thriller pattinson take on batman while certainly new for the character is not new for him twilight fans would understand and remember the broody and moody edward cullen pattinson channels the same energy here and not complaning it works wonders we have lot more of batman than bruce wayne in this film topping bale and keaton is not easy but feel pattinson is on his way obviously it is too early to tell more movies are planned but he certainly is on his way to be called the best batman he is phenomenal in his role wish could say the same about zoe catwoman jeffrey wright gordon andy serkins alfred they are grossly underused and underwritten they are such fantastic actors within themselves it almost feels criminal to have not fleshed them out on paper and on screen with bit more effort while bat and cat chemistry is sizzling on screen and that is what kept me for wanting more paul dano riddler was freakin terrifying and can stress this enough he gave me the goosebumps he was in mask for almost the entirety of the film and still could give you the chills have never seen or read more sadistic riddler his chemistry with the bat was off the charts in the pre climax scene making me clamour why this didn happen good hours ago reminding me of the bat and joker interrogation scene in the dark knight colin farrell as penguin is crazy and unrecognisable it was treat to watch so many villains of the bat together in film coming to the other technical aspects of the film cinematography is up close and personal letting you into the psyche of the character on screen greig fraser dune and many other notable works does tremendous job in capturing the mood of the film there are some extraordinary shots and scenes bat jumping from building car chase sequence bat fighting in tunnels etc just unbelievable which you just have to witness this is easily the most visually aesthetic superhero film have watched music is by another legend michael giacchino his bgm is edgy goes well with the tone of the film and enhances the visuals with the errieness translating through the music matt reeves and peter craig writing is top notch albeit some problems with character fleshing and pacing of the film there is this one scene which is an absolute favourite of mine where the bat unconscious is surrounded by about 20 cops in jail cell they try to unmask him and he wakes up and what follows is just stuff of dreams thoroughly enjoyed the batman by matt reeves it very strong film with good performances visuals and music it can grow into something extraordinary in the future with other films coming out it strong start the film though feel is mostly for batman purists we will enjoy the film more than some others but the reaction to the film has been crazy with what have read so far and it amazing to see viewers appreciating this film1.0\tomg just finished the movie in theatres must after zack synder justice league this one fans deserves to watch in theatre the every bit of scene every frame by frame batman was just wow the story as same as comic edition but they matt reeves done in the film is astonishing frever to watch in theatre the iconic movie is really worth to watch1.0\ttremendous job by matt reeves paul dano riddler should be looked at right with heath ledger joker as one of the great comic book cinematic villains robert pattinson made great batman and collin farrell was also excellent as coblepot look forward to the hbo series featuring him1.0\tliked it very much met the expectations but robert pattinson did not suit the role of bruce wayne except for the time when he was in the batman costume personally liked christian bale as the batman followed by ben affleck story was very good and looking forward the upcoming sequences from here1.0\twow saw the batman and was totally blown away always said no one could outdo michael keaton batman but was wrong this is definitely must see if they continue with movies of this calibre going to ve marvel run for it money1.0\tam not fan of the batman but really liked the dark knight and now the batman 2022 is long but really really good and robert pattinson is wonderful as batman the plot direction cinematography action music and actors are amazing must watch1.0\tit very positively different from all the other batman films if you like crime mystery detective thrillers you enjoy this one it very dialog driven with plot twists that keep you guessing it not for kids it dark gritty and tragic very entertaining ride1.0\tthis one is for the real comic book batman fans good music great cinematography real detective work and justified cool stuff along with gripping mystery at its core is what makes the batman great watch1.0\tthe movie starts impressively like the older films especially the dark night series robert pattison sinks into the character with ease he is really playing the role of humane batman rather than superhero zoe kravitz as cat woman shares great chemistry with robert pattison both the characters shows off their alter ego in suttle manner paul rano as riddler again is striking villainous character really commendable job by the entire team1.0\tthe same feeling you get when changing over page of comic your absolutely stuck into like the long halloween or year one is the same feeling you get every scene of this movie it just pure gritty comic dark serious stuff well done1.0\tthis movie encapsule everything about batman the evolution from vengeance to justice and fear to hope and havent even started on the cinematography of this movie which was magnificent and fitting1.0\tmovie was lonnngggg way lonngggg if you appreciate who bruce wayne is and his story this is not your batman michelle phifer would tear this cat women to shreds it no keaton or bale but very acceptable version you wait the whole movie for ending that satisfies and it just dosent happen0.0\tthis movie is so dark that you struggle to recognize characters and it sooooo slow and long it could have easily been an hour shorter loved the previous batman films but this one was just too obtuse0.0\tmeaningless movie dark knight series was million times better am appalled what was matt reeves thinking enjoyed joker too but this movie is bull hit1.0\tit very entertaining movie lets get that right robert pattinson is great batman and brings vulnerability to the character not sure we have seen in the past the story is good and extremely well thought out the villains are more real life and at certain points was not sure if was watching batman or hannibal lector1.0\tto be honest did walk into this movie with mixed feelings about the new crew but it definitely an enjoyable film which do recommend in 4d something never thought say the batman had big shoes to fill in which must say didn fall short from that the riddler had bigger shoes to fill as all batman movies have you expecting masterpiece villain performance especially after heath joker and onwards although the riddler played his psychopathic character well in comparison to the previous villains found him halfly as entertaining or fear inflicting some of the storyline seemed repetitive which didn anticipate well the cat woman was also bit underwhelming did enjoy however the other currupt characters namely the falcon and the pinguin overall its worth watching and an entertaining movie did it match the level of the dark knight or its sequels no but don think anyone expects it to but what didn expect was it not being far from it because still enjoyed it and look forward to the next one1.0\tbatman is back again what long way we ve come since 1989 and the supreme novelty of seeing the dark knight on the big screen decades films and incarnations later here comes yet another reset and given how surprisingly but justly enamored fans were with ben affleck take on the character the odds were heavily stacked against this one at this point fans really ought to know better but digress writer director matt reeves fresh from successfully rebooting another pillar of pop culture set his sights on vision for the caped crusader that harkens back to darren aronofsky mad pre batman begins raw idea of low tech bruce wayne riding around tokyo in bucket of bolts with hokey mask because the 20s are all about excess we can have something that low key but much of what made that idea intriguing translates to reeves vision this is not an origin story thank god but we are presented with relatively rookie batman prowling the streets of believable metropolis and though he does take quite few hard lickings he does grunt more than your typical batman his flip side is very insecure younger bruce wayne and as the usual lightning rod for fan scrutiny our star has lot to prove robert pattinson slips effortlessly into the part as do other veterans embodying quite fresh takes on very worn characters but more on them later in this newest of reboots we get our superhero mythos spliced with the likes of david fincher seminal seven and lo and he bold the world greatest detective tm actually does some detective work the crime thriller format allows for the odd scuffle and some inspired stunt work but the altered focus is breath of fresh air particularly given how well using the riddler as serial killer substitute works his motive and the nature of his eventual followers has terrifyingly credible grounded quality to it that makes the stakes feel more real than in any previous batman film paul dano is surprisingly chilling in the part at more cartoony end of the spectrum an unrecognizable gleeful colin farrell plays the penguin as mafia heavy channeling his inner goodfella to delicious effect sadly zoe kravitz and particularly jeffrey wright aren given much to do but mutter exposition to propel the batman along his quest and here comes the rub for film that really wants to be and then succeeds in being smarter than previous batman films this one seems to often lose faith in its own audience many dialogue scenes go on for just little bit too long spelling things out for us more than necessary which given the daunting runtime does test your patience at times not to mention your bladder stamina at the theater this is the longest batman flick by quite margin and without doubt between some dialogue trims and few endings too many it could have been shortened by good 15 minutes it is in effect one good script polish short of greatness on the technical side of things the result is as polished as you expect james chinlund creates magnificent sets and cinematographer greig fraser blasting his way to the top of the dp food chain these days lights and frames the proceedings to perfection the film visuals do veer dangerously close to anamorphic porn at times but on the whole the batman is masterclass in how to shoot modern blockbuster quick shout out to some of fraser collaborators ukrainian vintage lens refurbishers iron glass for the unique look of certain sequences the only bum note from key artistic contributors is truly uninspired score by michael giacchino who basically tries to expand the opening bars of john williams imperial march into something resembling theme it may not be the best thing since sliced bread but for superhero film it is surprisingly refreshing1.0\tthe batman is excellent movie robert pattinson shines as batman so does every other cast member in their role paul dano riddler is one of the best live action batman villians he scary and the acting is on point one thing loved was the soundtrack michael giachinno composed my favourite batman theme the story is great but the third act is little bit weaker than the first and second so ll be happily waiting for the sequel1.0\tchocked to the brim with great ideas the batman sees the caped crusader return as homicide detective digging into the corruption of gotham the sense of atmosphere mixed with an even tone and spectacular set design result in an entirely immersive experience the action set pieces are well put together and the choreography and sound design had me on the edge if my seat however the pacing of the nearly hour runtime is inconsistent which pulled me out of the movie the script was messy at times and as the mysteries unraveled the movie sense of purpose did as well by the end the story beats were just happening with little to no impact on character arcs or relevant themes it felt like the writers didn know how to end the movie1.0\twas sceptical when heard about the casting of robert pattinson as the batman but am surprised and delighted that this works so well christian bale hs been the perfect batman for me in is aura and physicality but the younger batman really finds his way through the portrayal that we can witness in this movie few negative points that need to be addressed andy serkis simply doesn work for me as alfred as this character reached its perfection in micheal caine and serkis is missing the warmth of this figure while catwomen surprised me lot as zoey kravitz was way better than expected in this role the shame lies in the writing she is often in scenes where you kind of think what is her purpose here and this is where the script shows its weaknesses many say the film is to long but disagree it perfectly portrays the character of gotham its film noir ambience and functions as heavy burden that sits on everyones shoulders especially batmans the final of the movie feels like the ending that the dark knight rises should have had and it cleverly steals from movies like the zodiac killer seven and other good movies of its kind super heroe movie that is more true detective than any marvel popcorn cinema waste of time this is how it done1.0\tvengeance is word that is used fair few times in the batman but then that is the caped crusader whole way of life to seek vengeance and punch his way through justice in the streets of gotham and in director matt reeves latest that is no exception the batman is well made well shot super noir bat flick that quite unexpected upon first viewing given it darker story and version of the masked vigilante that so dark and gritty that it will give the previous batmen run for their money robert pattinson is exceptional as both bruce wayne and the man in black he delivers gritty performance in an even grittier film that full of action and shocks especially when he faces against his cleverest arch nemeses the riddler here played by terrifying paul dano role which he was born to do of course the batman isn just about the action it works really well as stunningly contemporary yet also old fashioned crime thriller but then that what makes good batman film is if we can see him solving crimes and reeves isn afraid to get his audience in for the ride though coming at whopping 176 minutes don worry about it feeling too long there plenty enough going on there action and explosions it will get you thinking give you shocks and thrills that time goes by in flash it also quite an emotional story beneath the bat ears he all granite but off duty his story is tragic one farther from the usual comic book malarkey his is story of pure tragedy he hurts and that ok because beneath all that bat facade he all human as are the other characters and thanks to excellent casting the performances shine through that in pure colour and just because the film is grim and dark doesn mean the film doesn deliver in fact it does and it thrillingly bleak adventure that by far the caped crusader bleakest and most thrillingly ambitious live action outing yet and is worth the watch1.0\ttoo long bit monotonous for the first two hours very serious and drab with no levity police procedural element did not work was too drawn out and should have been condensed to 1hr 20 instead of 2h took too heavily from from better films like seven which ultimately did this film no favours as with joker kind of comedy taxi driver too long did say that but some excellent craft in terms of film making such as sound score and cinematography 3rd act was quite good thought but ultimately it failed for me overall give it mostly for effort1.0\twould ve liked little more bruce but this was very strong introduction to this hopefully new saga with focus on batman it keeps elevating up until the very last second one of the best batman movies ever and the ones that rank higher might just do for nostalgia purposes can wait for the next movie with another another villian1.0\tcan say much since this is spoiler free but that was hands down the greatest comic book movie of all time definitely the most comic accurate batman and the grounded realism of this film made it ten times better to watch we really need more of these dark and gritty movies from dc this is what they re good at gotta hand it to matt reeves this was an absolute masterpiece robert pattinson and paul dano delivered excellent performances as the batman and the riddler best performance by comic book villain since heath ledger joker in the dark knight0.0\tslow tedious purire plotline and barely acted this was waste of an opportunity over the last few years there have been some incredible storylines in the badmat comics that would have made excellent films instead we get this tosh they say it film about the bat being great detective where what detection the only detection was the basic clue sorting by alfred this falls down on every front the action sequences are no better than in low grade tv show the dialoge stilted and obvious could almost speak it along side the cast it was that obvious have no comments on pattinson as don know who or care who he is who ever may have been chosen can only do so much with project as bad as this maybe its time to treat comics properly and let those who actually write them produce the scripts instead of letting some hollywood shill mess things up1.0\tguess liked it but thought that it was too long would be the short one sentence review of the film there were some elements that really liked but would have preferred if the film lost it final action scene and few other moments along the way the riddler paul dano begins spree of killing high ranking officials from gotham city each crime scene includes message for the batman robert pattinson vigilante who tries to inspire fear in the criminal element of the city the case brings batman close to the reigning crime families of gotham and unfortunately provides link between them and his late father former mayoral candidate thomas wayne luke roberts think in my review of avengers endgame said that there can be too much of good thing after the batman less convinced that was correct back then whereas don think felt the length of that film here sure that did and hoped on couple of occasions that we reached the end only for the film to continue on in one case into large and hitherto unforeseen action sequence really liked that the film at least on the most part was genuine case of crime to solve rather than world or even city to save even if don think that the case strung together as cleverly as hoped it would the riddles are frankly garbage liked pattinson batman but there really isn enough of his time spent as bruce wayne to really get handle on what should be the more interesting aspect of the character never really liked dano riddler it very obvious suppose but did like the work that jeffrey wright was doing as james gordon that zoe kravitz was doing as selina kyle and that colin farrell was doing as the penguin where the film never fails is visually be it the dark constant rain of the city the blood red skies or the caped avenger appearing in the shadows again on the whole liked the film and think perhaps ll come to enjoy it more when can watch it at home in stages rather than consuming it as one big feast1.0\tthe batman is more grounded than any of its predecessors the first half is masterpiece the second half is bit letdown but still good robert pattinson was absolutely amazing and can potentially be the best ever batman however the dialogues and the climax are weak also the chemistry between batman and catwoman could ve been better overall must watch but not crowd pleasing movie1.0\tdon get me wrong the batman is great film but it certainly believes it is better than it is the good things this film doesn divulge into mindless action and explosions and we see bruce actually being detective there are some amazing shots in this movie that especially as comic book fan make you say yea that awesome the bad bland obviously it is gotham and it supposed to be dark crime ridden city but there is nothing that stands out there is no twist in this 3hr crime drama there is no defining moment of this film it plays more like short ark in tv show there are many scenes that are unnecessarily drawn out there is almost an overuse of realism in this movie batman is from comic book universe where ridiculous and fantastical things happen and we just spent the nolan trilogy with no supernatural things whatsoever my fear moving forward is that matt reeves won ever embrace the comic book nature of batman and the bat family or his rogues but in terms of what he was aiming for here pretty good1.0\tthe batman overall great movie and well worth watching at gargantuan hours and 55 minutes this was an exhausting but spectacular cinematic treat it was not without its problems of which will detail below and would guess were mainly caused by the stop start effect of global pandemic but this much awaited movie delivered in spades unlike the bond movie or spider man that just sadly disappointed and did not live up to expectations the movie was highly stylised with variable focusing directing the viewers gaze it was murky dark with obscure camera angles it was unsettling and meant to be so it was an exhausting experience to have your view directed around the screen novelty for few key scenes but not the whole movie must say didn notice the musical score except the beethoven but it fitted the movie robert pattinson not fan did great job he not only looked the part he brought brooding intensity to the role reminiscent of michael keaton version this was dark very dark normally this role does not require great deal of acting but there was particular scene with alfred in hospital bed where mr pattinson really stepped it up level and there was some fine acting of course playing opposite the chameleon master andy serkis would improve anyones game mr serkis chose michael caine delivery that was note perfect zoë kravitz who played celina kyle gave great and nuanced performance she mainly avoided strasberg method that rarely works on the big screen must say really enjoyed her part one funny aside she was meant to embody cat like characteristics and in the main she mastered this demand but if you notice when she walks between action scenes it is reminiscent of builders hod carrier lol the variety of hoods were also well drawn we really had proper evil here paul dano is very quirky looking actor but tremendous talent and addition to any movie now the problems cat women had line we need to do something about the rich white holes up there even in work of fiction casual racism is not acceptable along with the man shaming white shaming and tokenism the romantic element between cat woman and batman in their rubber outfits without any precursor to this moment was laughable and indeed everybody laughed in the cinema it was reminiscence of romantic attraction between two recycling bins lol current fixation with identity politics and origin stories the last time looked an empowered individual thrives under avarice and self determines their own life and future in spite of there childhood circumstance rather than rolling over and excepting the lot life has given them you can be both selina mother had an affair with club owner she decided to keep the baby she carried on working at the club and now her daughter works there to how this morphs into the absent father owing life debt having his business attacked etc is silly not to mention the absurd inference that batman father could suppress any story in mayoral campaign by silencing journalist is ridiculous there was several absurd plot twists with the most egregious being the motivation for becoming serial killer was closing down care home enjoyed the movie many will not as it was far from perfect but giving this firm outta 10 for holding my attention for three hours1.0\tit dark pretty engaging and has constant ominousity overarching throughout the almost hour runtime it very well made and executed such that the runtime feels warranted and compulsory were it to be shorter with cut scenes plots it would felt subpar story is good in its span and keeps the attention on screen and wanting to see more and more however though minutely minor it helplessly has some cheap or cringey lines and ideas or scenes acting wise needless to say pattinson was good collected performance and nothing over the top the overall catwoman character and story didn quite do anything for me but it serves its purpose well and there are some moments that kravitz elevated but if there was to be favourite it would definitely be dano as the riddler great character played by great actor all in all good addition in the line of batman films how it compares to nolan dark knight trilogy is still too early to say but if reeves were to continue this universe would wholeheartedly be looking forward with excitement would recommend0.0\tseriously do not know how people are rating this movie may be many of them are just rating based on the trailer but actually movie is extremely boring robert patinson was still acting as he was vampire not batman worst albert ever seems like the guy knew nothing about batman extremely low lighting and bad cinematography overall extremely boring movie0.0\twas really looking forward to watching this but just didn enjoy it all know in the minority but be warned if you find yourself watching it and you re also in that minority it gonna be long three hours don read the graphic novels and maybe overly attached to the nolan films but surprised the film been as well received as it has been it felt like forgettable episode of forgettable nineties action series thought it was visually very underwhelming and conceptually didn bring anything new was very bored by it which is shame because thought the casting was great am the minority though and glad everyone else is enjoying it now must fear the shadows of imdb lest hear the phrase vengeance be well1.0\tusually don like the superhero genre find marvel movies to be way to childish but this movie saw it days ago and am still thinking about it the way batman just really sets fear amazing1.0\tit pretty great overall ve seen it about week or so late and so it been hyped lot since its release but think it lived up to the hype will say the opening 20 minutes are perfect genuinely incredible and sets the tone perfectly overall think it the second best batman movie behind only the dark knight but think robert pattinson is the best live action batman keaton and bale were good of course but pattinson is on whole other level he an amazingly broody and quiet bruce wayne batman but not in way that feels silly or melodramatic the rest of the cast are all good too and fit their roles well it not as action heavy as other batman films but liked that as it gives it different feel and it cool seeing one of these movies emphasise the crime mystery elements more and when it does stage an action scene they look fantastic with great hand to hand fights and one really awesome car chase like how shadowy and dark the film looks visually with very few scenes taking place in the daylight it helps make it very atmospheric as does the score which is fantastic as good as any of zimmer and elfman efforts for sure think it feels little overstuffed at times and as great as the riddler is him sharing the spotlight with couple of other villains makes it feel like the movie forgets about him here and there whereas the joker presence loomed large throughout all of the dark knight for example the pacing is perfect for the first two hours but it dragged tiny bit in couple of parts in that last hour nothing major and while you feel the length and the film packs lot in think it largely manages to avoid feeling bloated still for delivering maybe the best on screen version of the character as well as putting forth an amazingly well realised vision that feels fresh and often surprisingly tense and unsettling the batman big success flaws here are minor when so many of its elements are great and the overall end product is this satisfying1.0\tit was overall enjoyable and like elements of it especially the riddler but feel like it had very poor time management don have problem with the movie being hours but expect to get more from those hours it has similiar problem to zack snyders justice league filling lot of time with longshots of faces or drawn out conversations that doesn really add too much think it wrong to compare it to the dark knight since this is most likely the first movie in trilogy but if instead compare it to batman begins still think batman begins is lot better largely due to what it achieves in hours and 20 minutes0.0\twhat disaster really poor direction plot is mix of soap opera and the departed but only bad elements of those two batmobile was 2nd hand uber performances were really really bad walked out with 20 mins left just couldn bear the trauma anymore you guys are remaking one of the most acclaimed superhero franchises have some respect and integrity in your effort most actors looked half interested the action scenes seemed like leftover footage from the hast and the furious gotham city looked worse than what it did in the movie joker and pattison can act total waste of effort had to come home and watch dark knight for 20 mins to get my sanity back1.0\tit hard to explain this movie with words so the best way figured was it is godfather type movie in the comicbook movie universe this movie is like an art piece like watching comic it is more about the scenery and emotions than just bland action it is dive into bruce waynes and more importantly batmans head and world comic accurate batman who isnt this super soldier like it seems in the nolan trilogy sometimes but more of an angry man doing his best to utilize fear and darkness to fight crime as batman fan could not have hoped for more and cant wait for the others to follow my advise is keep your mind clear while watching and do not expect marvel type of fast food movie put your mind and thoughts into it and you will enjoy it1.0\tnolan view better bruce all of batman trilogy had impeccable direction in terms of story writing and plot nolan all batman had one thing in common that they can be watched by all of the generations and they love it because they put the viewers as first priority as to in what way would viewers love to see the movie reeves view better batman the batman was great great movie in terms of individual performance in terms of plot and direction it was not at the peak however they didn try to copy or formulate nolan this movie lacked plotting but pattinson dano it worth alone to watch movie for these guys this movie would be loved by batman fans only not universal movie class act in terms of acting1.0\tthis movie is very long movie but the movie is so good and so intense that you don want to get up to go to the bathroom as you would ve in batman and robin the mystery of who is the riddler keeps you wanting to watch and see if you can spot him at the end when he revealed you re like remember him it was worth seeing this movie batman was played perfectly alfred was good riddler was amazing wasn as big on penguin but he wasn bad just felt like supporting character and this time they got catwoman right1.0\ttoo was skeptical on pattinson but he did the role justice and we finally get something decent from dc after the trash they have been releasing kravitz and pattinson have good chemistry1.0\tthis movie was 10 out of 10 stars had good feeling this movie would be amazing when heard wb executives hated this film was right every part of the movie was made full of emotion and great story that keeps your attention through the entire movie really hope reeves makes at least more of these batman films with pattinson this movie is the perfect vision of batman and its enjoyable that this movie has the courage to let batman be dark and be real like the character is meant to be really hated the pervious batman films where it seems the film makers tried to please every kind of person expectations making batman no one could like or understand big thanks to the makers of this film0.0\tthis guy doesnt fit to be batman he lacks muscles tough and suitable face such heroic character needs stronger actor give just for that1.0\teven matt reeves director writer and producer of the batman admitted that the batman is almost horror movie with one of the darkest and psychotic villians the franchise has ever seen the riddler he right reeves pulls from his experience in psychological thrillers including 10 cloverfield lane to bring an even darker version of the caped crusader despite the darkness the movie should have been cut further there just wasn enough substance to warrant hour movie this is where drew comparisons to christopher nolan dark knight trilogy which was sharply edited ended up doing some of my own cutting by using the fast forward button through scenes that seemed useless to the central plot adding to my dissapointment other characters were completely re invented and not for the better including cat woman and the penguin although do have to admit that the penguin while out of character was played well by colin farrell catwoman on the other hand was bit weak and couldn help the feeling zoe kravitz didn enjoy playing the character on positive note john turturro was brilliantly casted and truly shined as carmine falcone while paul dano was absolutely frightening as the riddler all in all wasn turned off and the film made enough of positive impression to stay on my mind the morning after watching it which is my metric for worthy film1.0\tif batman was the only character in the dc realm of comic book characters than that would still be enough to hold dc up as class above all other rivals in the field once again dc has shown batman is far and away the jewel in its comic universe crown and this time by simply adding another chapter to batman legacy was initially skeptical that anyone could ever improve on or at very least rival the legend that is christopher nolan the dark knight stand gladly corrected on that count not only does this version of batman add to the texture created by the incredible story line of the 2008 epic it adds further definition to what initially thought was batman already in its darkest and most raw depiction especially with heath ledger joker as the cornerstone and the introduction to harvey two face dent matt reeves has essentially pulled off some movie making genius by adding to the dark knight legacy without subtracting from or plagiarizing its tenets he managed to portray not only the darkness and inherent cynicism of the baddie protagonists but in brilliant twist shows the deeper and darker side to bruce wayne psyche and personality with just enough twists in historical facts as for casting this was as much master stroke as the dark knight was from pattinson kravitz dano and tutrturro we are given exemplary performances in their respective roles all played to perfection and each with feasible plausibility is that even thing too bad it is now the cast is completed amazingly well with wright as chief gordon farrell oz the penguin and andy serkis as alfred if nolan gave us the dark knight and the greatest ever batman arch nemesis performance by the late great heath ledger this permutation of batman gave us the darkest knight batman bruce wayne ever and to great and epic effect the cinematography and soundtrack exemplary and beautifully constructed to fit the story being conveyed in parting if you watch only one super hero comic based movie this entire year on the big screen make sure it is the batman you will regret it if you don1.0\tit feels like proper batman film the mystery inside this film was fun and impactful it been said that gothem was done really well and strongly agree it different and darker interpretation of the bat the performances buy the actors was brilliant especially batman played buy robin pattinson he was great in the role the action was also really cool and well done the effects and the batmobile were stunning to look at and visually buitiful and night time setting was unique and different the effects were also vibrant gothem looked like proper place that how well think the movie was done do think it masterpiece to answer your question no think it was too long and could of been tighter why did you give it 10 10 then because think this is brilliant film and it one of my all time favourite movie good storyline that intertwined really interestingly with the overall story and great ending that was definitely gripping 10 10 amazing0.0\tthe worst batman movie ever costumes are bad theatrics bad cgi is bad movie effects are cliché story line is an old one and nothing new to it the cheesiest batman and most boring movie ever1.0\tthis gritty dark violent and well told story about vengeance revenge and political corruption apart from his continual pouting the actor known for the teenage focused vampire versus werewolf romance has befitted the cape and cowl and that was hard for me to say the running time is nothing to worry about as the film streams along from one action sequence to another with noir like detective investigation plotline in between the character introductions pull no punches as they are all grounded in as much reality as possible even the costumes looked made in mother basement the story of political deception is as old as socrates but the wayne history has had facelift in surprisingly understandable version even alfred has changed into more believable custodian of bruce fortune and education they even live in different dwelling no mansion nor secret batcave in this version thought seen enough batman stories told on the big screen but this version just upped the ante more believable vigilante action adventure that ll leave you wanting more1.0\tyesterday we went to the movies to watch the new batman the whole group are fans of the dark vigilante and we anticipated this film for long time pros well first of all liked the fact that gotham was dark gothic mysterious dangerous as it is supposed to be the high criminality and the corruption explains why this city needs batman and that thumbs up to the director that puts the viewer in position that feels all this danger robert pattinson is new edition of batman and think he did great we see an emotional sad loner bruce wayne that gives us new perspective of the character and what he is being through and not so unbeatable dark hero he has his weaknesses not so many gadgets on his suit classic bike and just muscular car he looks great with the batsuit in the combat is pretty violent and gruesome and acts lot like detective cons the scenario has nothing new to offer not really impressed with the villains could say was only surprised with farell transformation as penguin catwoman needed more time in the movie as think is main character in the batman universe so expected to play more the duration of 180 minutes are too much that got tired and that because the storyline has nothing exciting would recommend it to anyone who wants to see another batman movie but am not sure if would re watch it on dvd later1.0\tfinally dark and realistic interpretation of the gotham knight since nolan trilogy we didn have the chance to see batman struggling and fighting corruption and crime like he did in matt reeves adaptation the darkness and violence we have seen was close to everyday scuffles in addition the audience slowly melted with the brutality and the atmosphere shown in gotham city furthermore the cinematography was perfect emphasising the role of each character especially our dark knight also the soundtrack which helped the audience to merge into this dramatic world we can finish this review with telling that the simplicity of the story is the only aspect that didn let me give rate of 10 10 however we must not forget the great performance of the cast and of course pattinson who is going to start new legendary era of our beloved black masked man1.0\tit was the best batman movie ever robert pattinson as batman was awesome paul dano as the riddler was incredible the penguin was awesome and catwoman was amazing can wait for the batman sequel1.0\thave watched every movie of batman it true no one can beat christian bale dark knight that movie raised the level of superhero movies after that new movies of batman was not upto the mark but after viewing this can say batman is back on track1.0\tyou shouldn waste your time on movie that has action every 30 minutes go watch new michael bay film so your ape brain can be stimulated with cars blowing up and guns blazing every seconds1.0\tanyone who ever wants to write angry or depressed characters should pay close attention to this film because this is by far the most sympathetic live action batman ve ever seen robert pattinson was absolutely legendary in this film he expressed so much with his eyes alone and portrayed the character as someone who could really feel for and root for which is rare in modern media all the other acting was great too as was the directing the cinematography the soundtrack and the writing love the character of batman but until now don think anyone has really pulled off the emotional or sympathetic side of him in live action the animated series is the goat as they say think that the biggest reason why loved this film so much it was film with so much kindness and empathy more than ve seen in long time it feels like finally someone gets it matt reeves and robert pattinson really seem to get the character can wait for sequel and really hope they continue the tone that they set with this one0.0\treally have no idea why this was rated so highly it was way way too long brooding dark and frankly boring so miss christopher nolan direction and vision pattinson was dull and lifeless and frankly hard to root for alfred was mostly missing cat woman was nice addition earning at least some relief from boring brooding pattinson1.0\tmatt reeves has given us batman befitting the times dark and anxiety ridden more raymond chandler than previous big screen renditions the batman is brilliantly staged drama that at three hours long doesn seem bloated or in any way convoluted when the climax of the movie comes it exciting and satisfying unlike the false ending that blighted the dark knight once more around the track that felt so exasperating the finale of reeves movie actually delivers kudos to robert pattinson for his troubled take on the bruce wayne batman character never laying it on too thick and always holding the viewers attention and also to zoe kravitz for being an engaging and feisty selina kyle catwoman and as for colin farrell all can say is wow for one sincerely hope that this is just the first in an ongoing series of batman movies of this ilk finally the batman is actually detective albeit vengeful one0.0\texpected much shouldn have having seen this movie might easily be the most disappointing cinema experience this year 2022 is still young know but it hardly imaginable seeing any other movie this year where the gap between expectation and my subjective reality will be even bigger what makes me say that well to me the batman felt just like painfully generic action film stretched to hour marathon of bombast and unrelatable overacting without any depth it even made me think about leaving the cinema hall earlier don get me wrong really did enjoy the dark knight the dark knight rises and especially the joker know this here is not character study but in comparison to those ones at least to me the new batman almost feels like an obsessive attempt to make the cash tills ring1.0\tmean it wasn bad of course but after that hype saw everywhere and everyone saying that this is the best superhero movie ever had really high expectations everyone was saying that this batman will be depressed tired of life etc but didn feel that only sign that he was depressed was that he had that black make up around the eyes liked villain but literally forget that he was in this movie for most part and his final plan was nice oh and the music was perfect ofc really enjoyed it if there wasn that much hype would probably rate this higher but instead there is only0.0\tthey managed to butcher every single thing that made batman the batman first of all bruce wayne shouldn look like long time drug user his fighting style should bestealth and fear and not will let you shoot me so you can see how awesome my armor is like in this movie story has no plots no excitement you can predict 99 of things that will happen not to mention lack of back story the whole character lost its style class and mystery that followed every version of batman for the end have to say its not only the worst batman movie but one of the worst movies in general watched hope they will stop here and not move on this guy should go back to playing fency vampires and leave batman to actors with seniority and class1.0\tdon get me wrong here thought it was good movie but what gives with all the darkness understand the story is hard boiled and meant to be taken seriously but did it all have to be shot in the dark even the daytime sequences are dimly lit and gloomy if it weren for that and for the absolutely depressing bruce wayne scenes thankfully there are very few scenes featuring bruce wayne it was really good film the acting is top notch the writing is impressive and the direction was on point it the cinematography where this movie fails to impress me shot almost 100 in the dark with little to no light to it my eyes actually hurt after coming out of the theater it didn do any of the action sequences any favors either during the batmobile chase scene had hard time even seeing what was going on other than the penguin reactions and let talk about that shell of bruce wayne mean you can tell that pattinson put lot of effort to embody the batman but anytime he was bruce wayne it felt like he was playing zombie with no reason to live just utterly depressing because that is definitely not the bruce wayne that thought knew and definitely not someone who is supposed to be such vital part to the city of gotham seemed like an edgy take just to be edgy thankfully that is only presented hand full of times and isn hard pressed into the film my only other gripe with the film is that it could have been about 20 minutes shorter if they had just edited out some of the lingering shots of the dark city get we are going for scary more serious tone for batman movie but mon it got old quick overall good movie that could have been great if not for the terrible lighting and emo take on rich philanthropist superhero still doesn come close to the absolutely groundbreaking christopher nolan trilogy and even though paul dano was absolutely terrifying as the riddler he still cannot hold candle to heath ledger brilliant and iconic performance as the joker1.0\tperhaps the best compliment can give to the film is that it doesn feel like it has three hour duration at all and it not boring at any point can only say that for couple of films in the whole history there is always something going on the plot is fluid the tempo is great and we meet gallery of characters who are important for the plot of the film this version of batman is much darker certainly the darkest so far have to admit that few times while watching thought of the movie seven which by the way for me is one of the best ever the reason lies in the dark atmosphere that acts almost like another special character in the film the rain is constantly falling the action takes place mostly at night and in the dark and the future of the city of gotham does not look positive at all considering the type and genre of the film must say that this is detective psychological thriller with elements of action and the mafia also plays very important role it is clear to you from this description that this is miles away from some average superhero movie probably not for everyone then the cast in the film is very good and great robert pattinson has come long way from that glittering vampire for almost decade he did not star in hollywood blockbusters but devoted himself to less well known independent films playing not easy roles so here he fits perfectly the role of the younger bruce wayne who is tormented by inner demons the past as well as the many problems that have befallen his city very convincing and realistic role in this version riddler as the main villain is really masterful and creepy and the role went well with paul dano who may not be such an exposed actor but his film cv is also more than impressive colin farrell surprised me the most positively personally as an actor don really like him but in my opinion this is the best role in his life he looks unrecognizable as penguin but not only that but his speech behavior and acting in general are extremely convincing believe many won even know he acting here unless they ve read it somewhere before the rest of the cast is very good really have no complaints everyone has done exactly what is required in particular role from that person personally have seen the great impact of the arkham video game series on this film starting with the visual appearance of the city the costumes of batman and catwoman the influence of the mafia as well as detective work and problem solving not sure how much that was the director intention but very glad that it went in that direction given the quality of the film as well as some hints expect and hope for trilogy batman has so many characters and stories that ten films can be made and this version turns to some newer and more modern stories so think it will continue to go in that direction was little scared when saw that there are lot of characters because usually it doesn turn out well many don get good background story they spend little time on the big screen so it doesn work as good whole am very glad that this project was captured by director reeves who managed to realize his story and his vision here think he succeeded in that completely very tense film for almost the entire duration unpredictable it leans lot towards great thrillers like the aforementioned seven or zodiac three hours almost flew by maybe it up to me too because really adore psychological thrillers so this movie suited me perfectly1.0\tthe best batman in long time back to basics when batman was still detective comic more thriller than superhero movie like the more realistic approach1.0\tyou think by now we be done with batman adaptations but this is whole different thing want to rewatch the dark knight to reassure myself it still the best one knew robert pattinson zoe kravitz and the rest of the cast were capable actors but still had reservations about this because thought they were trying to mask mediocre film with star lineup but after watching it like he was built for the role this is different superhero movies are usually just entertainment but this is more than just that you don have to be fan of the genre to enjoy it even if you are one you re still going to enjoy it batman is still in the streets beating people to pulp for answers so if you re looking for the action it still there but unlike recent adaptations this time around you get to see why he called the greatest detective even though he still was somewhat outsmarted by the riddler we get to find batman early in his crime fighting campaign debating whether or not he changing gotham for the better while still dealing with his past trauma and emotions his orphanhood and vengeance are put more into the spotlight bruce wayne is merely just shadow of batman here and we rarely get to see him the whole focus is solely on batman and unraveling the murder mystery conspiracy and how he involved in it it dark it gritty and it art renowned film directors and producers like martin scorsese ridley scott and others have often said superhero movies aren cinema understand where they re coming from but inclined to disagree and think the batman is enough to sway them robert pattinson really made the role his own and was surprised at just how good young dark and broken down batman he played he exceeded my expectations he also nailed the voice zoe kravitz as catwoman didn exceed but did meet my expectations and the chemistry the two shared was stunning adding the riddler performance to it just brought all the pieces together was mind blown at how much colin farrell transformed for his role we don see the most out of the penguin here but think it was really good casting and looks like he set to have bigger role in the sequel along with the riddler and joker1.0\tnot someone who ranted on line when they announced robert pattinson as the next batman don take it that seriously don count myself big robert pattinson either that what made this movie such pleasant surprise it is dark and brooding as it should be because the story is based on the dark knight era of the comics shot in way that makes it feel like it would have fit in 30 years ago instead of have fit 30 years ago old time story telling beautiful shot and the film allows all the tension to build in the scenes no flash cuts unrealistic vehicles and cgi dark and raw and entertaining1.0\tlove it just simply love it been hoping and they didn let me down very proud of how great movie can be direction and music is good also can spam for the last part it need 150 words what else can say the female lead is so beautiful1.0\twhole movie felt like was playing an akham game enjoyed every moment perfect cast perfect acting perfect action sequences this movie does not disappoint1.0\tdetective batman approachable batman felt like soft batman unlike chris nolan batman who worked selflessly for gotham this batman expects something in return maybe appreciation little cheer or whatever this batman lacks lucius fox and subsequently makes batman stuffs on his own this bruce wayne is on the path of reinventing himself more than the experienced ones we are all used to there easter egg for hush right in the middle of the movie and hint of joker at the end going by dceu track record expect nothing and you ll not be disappointed1.0\tafter the ape comes the bat matt reeves is tackling his next project after his highly acclaimed planet of the apes trilogy batman is to become darker gotham dirtier and its inhabitants even more corrupt and vicious even more so than it all was in christopher nolan dark knight three parter an anti superhero film which actually only observes the hero and not the man under the mask and shows how he sets out on his search for clues with the riddler reeves introduces us to villain who was last seen on screen in joel schumacher batman forever the jim carrey version was much more of comic relief character than bloodthirsty antagonist paul dano plays traumatised and mentally unstable avenger who seeks revenge on the city that has caused him so much pain in parallel corruption in gotham around mob boss and mayor carmine falcone john turturro is still huge problem batman wants to put an end to all these tormentors robert pattinson is the new caped crusader although he always calls himself vengeance bruce wayne is only in his second year as crime fighter and is not factor in gotham in his life without mask he lives reclusive life is deeply sad and constantly focused in his head on his role as hero in this respect pattinson version differs fundamentally from that of christian bale for example who played the arrogant pretty boy who was not too shy to make grand entrance in general we hardly ever see pattinson not in costume when he inspects crime scenes with lieutenant james gordon jeffrey wright no one knows his identity to the other cops he freak who uses his fists more than his brains to catwoman zoe kravitz he is mysterious introvert but she immediately reads his privileged status in life kravitz carries this film in the first half with her confident portrayal of this internally fractured character we see catwoman with backstory and clearly defined mission so does the unrecognisable colin farrell as falcone right hand man the penguin he provides most of the laughs in an otherwise humour free film case in point pattinson face shows something like smile exactly once in three hours of running time andy serkis as the only human component in bruce wayne life suffers from the fact that this is pure batman film judging by that we get the character study of the title character that we never had in the nolan films to be that the film puts too much focus on the investigation interminable dialogue between characters and the depiction of filthy gotham never has the city been so pessimistic and hopeless it fits perfectly into the batman which makes you more depressed than happy from cinematic point of view however you can walk away from this film with big grin on your face never has superhero film been so beautifully filmed the music by michael giacchino brings up thriller elements and although the film is so long and at times sluggish you sit riveted until the end it not packed with action though one car chase is one of the best in film history doesn bristle with cgi effects and doesn have big showdown it the quiet intimate superhero film we ve never had1.0\tmatt reeves has made the definitive batman film with the batman robert pattinson eyes are so intense observant under the black cowl while michael giacchino score is grand haunting masterwork an epic dark thematically rich neo noir1.0\tspectacular direction that truly captures the essence of the character performances are subtle and quiet but land punch pattison embodies batman gotham feels real surprisingly well paced for film with this long of runtime engrossing score gets better with every viewing1.0\tthe batman was quite an interesting film the main focus of this film is the revealing of corrupted gotham robert pattinson did wonderful job portraying batman paul dano playing more sadistic riddler was also excellent the first act in the film was bit unengaging at times but the build towards acts and was well done the batman was good film but the length of the film was unreasonably long1.0\tbest movie in the entire history of movies robert is the batman paul is the riddler the story is perfect all about this movie is great and enjoyable wish see lot of this version of gotham the best vision of gotham have ever watch am in love with this film watched twice and have no problem to watch it many more time thanks for all who have worked on this masterpiece1.0\tgo see it now it is real batman film he does everything in the dark and freaks the living hell out of people suggest not to let kids under 13 to watch it0.0\tfirst of all it was too long hours could have been cut from this hated cat woman what was she lezzy anyway could have cut all of her out but hey woman hater was hoping she die she didn colin farrell as penguin you didn even know it was him disappointing always hated dano was so glad when he was killed with wooden bowling pin on there will be blood it was just awful however it gets stars for good reason the car chase and charger batmobile that it the kid he saved that gonna be his boy toy robin pattinson was ugly but never thought he was nice looking love the suit all that leather1.0\tthe title says it all colin farrell is unrecognizable and amazing as the penguin the riddler is scarier before he unmasked pattinson does great job at playing young really angry batman bale did better job as some bits but pattinson does better with the rage and sorrow bale just doesn seem to have that part of the range serkis was good as alfred but no one is better than sir michael caine zoe kravitz was divine she played her part perfectly this movie could have been just as good and half an hour shorter1.0\tthis movie was very good overall but there is scene of catwoman making political statement about white privilege don see what it had to do with the relation of the story im sorry but want to watch batman not politics wouldn want to watch movie where its about politics like for example what if catwoman wore trump hat and talked about election fraud wouldn want to either it not fun or enjoyable also don want political statement to ruin my view on batman movies like said earlier this movie was very good overall1.0\tthe batman is the new installment for the dark knight this time like most of other versions it does not depend on setting up or being part of bigger universe and works great because of it first thing to say about this movie robert pattison killed it as batman will admit he is my favorite batman yet but he is not my favorite bruce wayne the rest of the cast nailed their performances but the one that blew my mind off and pulled me more into the movie was zoe kravitz as selina catwoman the plot is great and even though the runtime was bit long for my taste the film was as long as it needed to be this film is not going to be typical superhero full of action comic book movie that we being getting for years this version focus more on the detective side of batman and is something new that we have never seen before on the big screen another thing to praise on this film is the production itself the cinematography on this movie is incredible especially how they combine that with the direction on the beginning of the film the soundtrack just to say if you are fan of batman 1989 and the batman the animated series you will get goosebumps while hearing the new version in this film overall is new and very well welcomed version of the dark knight that will most likely leave you to want sequel it is almost hours movie but with the exception of few scenes it will keep you from looking at your watch1.0\tspoiler only the first 5m of the movie so everything is perfect in this movie maybe it long time 3h 2h 56m but still one of the greatest batman movie ever this is masterpiece and the sot can explain it the sot when batman is coming and the intro in being with this quote it not just sign it warning one of the greatest movies1.0\tyesterday watched the batman in the cinema absolutely without spoilers the story is very dark suspenseful and multi layered narratively the pace is slow and steady and for every scene and dialogue the producers and matt reeves have taken the necessary time to make everything feel right basically the film is crime thriller with small amount of action which really like the hell out of the combination and composition in addition this batman contribution is much more down to earth than even nolan batman which already went the more down to earth route but then also went extreme again in the action scenes and thus also often greatly exaggerated not meant in negative way matt reeves the batman is simply darker more serious and more down to earth also the running time of 175 minutes doesn seem too long or exhausting at all enjoyed every minute of it acting wise the film has top cast with many well known and popular actors performance wise all the actors actresses also play really believable and well especially robert pattinson of course who was really an excellent choice for batman bruce wayne like the cinematography and editing extremely well the camera is always steady offering great perspectives and lots of wide shots even in the action scenes you always keep good overview greig fraser who also directed dune did great job here and the cuts are not too fast and random which also deserves praise the action scenes are rare in the film but they are really brute grandiose choreographed and staged and underpinned with perfect sound mixing the spatiality and dynamics are simply feast for the ears the cgi effects are very respectable and offer no reason for criticism also like the set design and the backdrop of gotham exceptionally well also really liked the soundtrack and especially the theme music sticks in my mind michael giacchino has shown good hand here the costumes are also all great but especially like the batsuit didn notice any real weaknesses the most could criticize is that the theme music repeats itself too often and that the film like watchmen is one of those that don watch every year but definitely every few years this batman movie definitely ranks up there with the best batman movies for me really strong movie and definitely one of the best of 2022 10 points medium rewatch value1.0\thad reserved expectations for this film but after viewing couldn have expected much better the style of the plot is enjoyable for crime thriller fanatic however can see why some might not like it because it isn the archetypical superhero movie there is real depth to the characters and the cinematic shots feel more of video game feeling with long panning views the only knock against this movie is that felt it could have ended 30 minutes sooner but it did set itself up for great second movie1.0\tnow that how you do neo noir batman dark brooding and insidious the batman is truly classic in every way shape and form matt reeves hits yet another home run by delivering not only one of the best batman dc movies but also one of the best comic book movies ever made robert pattinson has truly transformed himself into different kind of beast gone are the days when people judged him as the twilight guy zoe kravitz fits into the role of catwoman like glove even she gave stunning performance1.0\tthese are just some of the words would use to describe this nothing less than stellar movie robert pattinson does the role justice both as batman and bruce wayne cat woman character is actually very sincere and well thought out the riddler is just wow just wow the penguin is surprisingly good collin ferrell does good job modernizing the role the new jim gordon alfred etc almost everyone is perfectly cast in this movie the action is great the story is well thought out and paced the cinematography is through the roof and the tone of the movie is very fitting for this style of batman enjoyed batfleck as well as christian bale pattinson is fine addition to the gentleman who have more recently played the caped crusader1.0\tjust watched it today and blown away the cinematography on its own was marvellous really nailing the gritty dirty vibe of gotham city in way we haven seen yet while highlighting bits of beauty to make point of it the characters were performed how perceive to be perfectly pattinson is more than convincing as younger obsessed batman as polar opposite of batfleck and his broken older cynical batman pattinsons is driven angry and has little interest in life outside the cowl very much loved the identity struggle theme kravitz gives an addictive performance as catwoman tough quick thinking vulnerable but dangerous colin farrell as penguin was unexpectedly fantastic the prosthetics team deserve an oscar jim gordon is the best ve seen him played in my opinion shown as an optimistic beacon of hope among the grim visage of gotham you can tell batman looks up to him in lot of ways alfred was the harder one to get but only because there not enough of him but what we see is more mentally involved alfred he part of bruce investigations and liked that falcone was done perfectly too very good gangster trope with few twists riddler has truly unique interpretation in this film and it refreshing to have the character as far away from any other performance of riddler so far he uncomfortable to watch and that part of the point really all in all perfect casting what made me give this full 10 10 is the world building didn feel like was being treated like and idiot but didn feel like the story stopped to tell me story it was all seem less now know what this gotham is and how it got there the hints at other characters were many some subtle and some obvious but moving forward the director has so many viable options that the future of this particular batman franchise is possibly the most exciting thing in comic movies right now also side note the penguin series sounds great the arkham series sounds super interesting and the catwoman series sounds like winner looking forward to all three now1.0\tneed to be honest just wanted to watch this film because liked the robert pattinson acting in the hole twilight saga think that most of people don agree with me but he perfect batman actor the last thing wanted to say is that didn know that oz is played by collin farrell feel surprised about that1.0\tnew criminal is being actif in gotham called the riddler who is trying to kill the known political figures in the city those who might be included in dirty works and the mysterious journey of batman to find this psychopath well this is absolutely cinema mr scorsese the 2022 batman is very unique than the ones we saw before pattinson bruce wayne isn social person which suits me the batman himself is more violent gotham is more and more dirty full of darkness full of evil representing the villains was good especially the riddler my favorite one the beginning of the story was pure thrill batman is playing the role of detective trying to reach the riddler who is doing batman work differently and here should mention that was wondering what is evil exactly because this man is helping gotham somehow got the answer by the end after all this beautiful things in the story let talk about directing visuals and sound effects this is the powerful part of the film gotham was drowning in the dark every shot is darker than the other those hints of red orange and blue in the main black theme feds my eyes the cinematography is just perfect and those fight scene and explosions are visually pleasing to see the batman in terms of sound was as great as the visuals were beautiful soundtracks and sound of punches might be the most well made ve ever seen one of the remarkable things in this batman movie are the performances pattinson as batman was risky everybody wasn sure if he can make it but hell yes he did he gave as dark version of bruce wayne and savage one of batman zoë kravitz and her chemistry with pattinson was good and her performance too paul dano what an actor at first was wondering what is good about his performance he was covering his face using sort of sound effects to talk it wasn really paul dano but again got the answer by the end some good performances from collin ferrell and john turturro as the pinguin and falcone jeffrey wright james gordon was absolutely not the best one but he was good at acting and finally andy serkis played alfred in different way that don prefer prefer the old alfred and the wise one that means the dark knight alfred doesn it wonderful work matt reeves can wait to get more of his batman especially that the end is very promising to start new film from god bless batman we need him as gotham does fear is tool when that light hits the sky it not just call it warning1.0\tevery bad review read was someone stuck on the old batman movies or comparing it to the comics or even twilight if anything this movie seemed to be the most realistic and we got to see the detective side of batman even read one review that got upset cause there was no jokes like what also don think people realize how much of good actor pattinson actually is1.0\tlet get this out of the way first the batman is not fun movie to watch that doesn mean it bad but it does take itself really seriously which it should when your main character is brooding 24 it seems director matt reeves finally made movie which feel the caped crusader himself would watch timing out at just short of hours the batman is like the ultimate anti marvel formula it avoids creating gaps for comedic timings and despite still being blockbuster it not afraid of having bigger focus on complex detective plot for many including myself this modern noire style is an approach long overdue for the dark knight himself dark knight which is at his most scariest version casting urban emo vampire robert pattinson as the titular character created dark knight which inspires hope as much as it does hopelessness whenever he joins scene academy award winning michael giacchino score lands immediately it is loud unescapable and monumental showcasing the inevitability of the fate of whoever is foolish enough to stand in the dark knight way that being said this is the most beautiful batman movie ve ever seen greig fraser cinematography plasters dramatic visual tone over the entire thing it is sad but hopeful but going back to the bat or better bruce wayne he has to be the most distant implementation of the playboy billionaire we ve had yet wouldn even call him playboy unlike in other movies in which wayne starts james bond flirting and is strong enough to flex his money to reduce suspicions pattinson wayne is man of few albeit striking words both in and out of costume he truly is far gone tortured soul reminiscent of pattinson twilight years except this time it actually good speaking of flirting zoë kravitz catwoman is carrying her own emotional weight as well so much so that when she and batman share kiss it doesn even feel like pleasure but more like painkiller indeed pain seems to be the weight reeves is placing on his characters it is something necessary for his overly serious approach to work there has to be enough drama to justify all this movie depressing tendencies speaking of which paul dano riddler is about as blunt as mental disorders can get his performance is career highlight one which inspires fear despise and even empathy the batman is almost too long almost its complex plot which seems to thicken more as it unveils more of its secrets is worthy of detective story it often contains montages of visual and poetic acuities and while not all its revelations are as shocking as they want to be they are all worthy of your time yes the entire three hours0.0\tthis movie version of batman is the worst version ve ever seen it way beyond silly real time and money waste batman solving puzzle of mental illed man what shame payed 36 to watch it in 4dx theater disappointed honestly the last 20 minutes were the best of the whole movie don bother yourself to watch it1.0\tit was an amazing experience loved the dark and brooding take of batman as it was finally done right the villain was great and paul dano puts on an amazing performance did it need to be hours no did enjoy almost every last bit of it yes1.0\tstunning and intense movie from the opening credit with the narration of vengeance to the beautiful cinematography and the acting of the whole cast the batman is mastered puzzle robert pattinson delivered one of the best performances in comic book movie ever1.0\tyou ever wish they made batman movie set in the 90 with the gritty look of the crow and detective style of seven well here it is no super powers flying cars billion dollar playboy parties just regular ass batman beating people up with his fists really really loved this movie in fact just changed my rating from to because just decided to watch again in theaters think if you liked any christian bale batmans you will love this one if you like the og keaton batmans you will love this one if you enjoyed the joker dark mood you will love this one all in all this was one of the best batman movies in long time truly recommend this film1.0\ttip my hat and sign off by saying that this trilogy is going to be special one not just for dc fans but for cinema lovers too robert pattinson you re gem1.0\tcomic occurate best batman my all time fav one nolan trilogy batman 2nd this the batman my fav music was brilliant cinematography was awesome robert was brilliant batman first level batman acting1.0\tnever has there been truer encapsulation of batman committed to screen you truly feel the rage of pattinson as well as his humanity which radiates through his doubts mark of good film is if you don feel the runtime and didn it definitely the thinking person batman it being 15 in the uk helps this as hopefully you ll be luckier than and not have two people in your showing that clearly lacked the capacity to follow the narrative1.0\twow this is batman movie no seriously as batman fan this movie is everything ve ever wanted movie finally did justice to the name world greatest detective robert pattinson is perfect paul dano riddler is freaking scary as hell all of the cast gave it their all matt reeves truly created something special for us greig fraser cinematography is freaking amazing along with michael giacchino phenomenal score it never felt like hour film fast paced plot with great action sequences there always something going on there are some minor pacing issues here and there but no biggie as said as batman fan this is the perfect movie for me but at the same time really can tell how the general audience will feel this isn your typical superhero action flick you have to be patient there are lot of things going on and that all comes together in great third act so yup great movie go and watch it in the biggest screen possible0.0\tdon watch the headache nonsense and not good entertainment single color through out only dark and feels like have just watched some trailer1.0\tno spoilers just loved every aspect of this movie other than one woke line wouldn want anything to be changed about this movie it not like other superhero movies the hero doesn necessarily win the stakes are high the villain is sympathetic the hero is the main focus of the story not once did this movie try to do something that wasn relevant to the plot we see the side characters through the pov of the hero which is why they weren explored properly their series are in work for further exploration though this movie was closer to mask of phantasm and long halloween than it was to the dark knight know comparisons are inevitable but this movie is whole different ball game if you are expecting lots of action this movie isn for you if you don have stomach for violence this movie isn for you if you can sit through plot heavy movie this movie isn for you if you want to have light hearted time with family and friends this movie isn for you manage your expectations and this movie will deliver it does what it set out to do which is telling very noir detective thriller that focuses on batman it is not your typical superhero movie it is going to expand the horizon of how superhero movies are made completely ground breaking comic book movie won compare it to any other comic book movie because there is no other comic movie that is like this movie it can work both ways but it mostly works in favor than in against this movie there is no weaker 3rd act as many reviewers have pointed out if you follow the plot it was completely necessary to give batman his much needed character development everyone involved in this movie gave their 100 and they all delivered especially paul dano and collin farell but it was robert pattinson who was really the break out star of this movie and matt reeves may you live long and bring us fans this batman goodness1.0\twas expecting bad movie because of the cast choice oh boy was so wrong every shot is worth movie poster the choice of lights colors and camera position is simply genius must watch in imax for the sound and screen0.0\twanted to see what the hype is about sure enough was not surprised by that mean it didn give me the same excitement or pulled me into the film like christopher nolan batman begins the dialogues were excessively long and understandably it was trying to be detective genre so parts of the movie also felt like it was plagiarized from david fincher seven although some acting were believable and liked cat woman portrayal entire story and cinematography made me yawn and looked at my watch at least three times throughout this film was also too dark to the point that got distracted by the theater exit signs several times to remind myself what dark knight movie should be am re watching nolan dark knight trilogy as we speak0.0\tan overly morose and drab version of batman with one note script perfectly conceived to feature one note lead actor the supporting cast of characters follow similarly sparse developmental path to match have never seen andy sirkus talent so wasted though his given direction paired perfectly with the least clever script and story ark for the iconic alfred pennyworth on the other hand it was treat to see paul dano get to work through his complete set of wonderfully disturbing acting sequences that he been developing for his menagerie of psychologically punished characters throughout his so far awesome career my main concern initially hearing that the legendary superhero batman traditionally fantasized as the pinnacle of human physical ability would be portrayed by the waifish robert pattison made me question warner bros decision making many fans were skeptical that the thespian had the ability to suspend audience belief as convincing superhero however was pleasantly surprised to see my fear put to rest when all the elements of choreography lighting camera angles and yes pattison work came together for the action sequences though do not know the ratio of his work vs the stunt double the action scenes were easily the most entertaining part of the batman they were fast decently visceral and fairly realistic for fantasy film though there were decent few of them peppered throughout the film the ratio of drama vs action scene ratio seemed sparse considering the obese three hour run time which felt more like five fun fact director matt reeves keenly reacted to pattison lack of expression torturing him for 40 takes during one of the scenes working to provoke the actor for greater emotional response unfortunately he had to eventually move on and suggest all but the most diehard batman fans do the same1.0\tcombination of the movie seven and zodiac set in the dark and gritty streets gotham creates chilling ambiance it makes everything feel grounded in the real world where there nothing shiny or flashy to make the atmosphere and story unbelievable everything is well thought out and crafted to engross and make you believe in the world and characters and must say the opening of the movie gave me goosebumps the city of gotham feels like its own character and it the most moody and dark we have ever seen the city it feels like its own thing place nobody would want to live and not the new york chicago we saw in the nolan trilogy this isn the usual playboy bruce wayne but instead depressed and hardened man with some mental issues and fear of loss we go into his psych where we see his struggles and overcomings every actor and actress brings their game and truly loose themselves and at times its actually terrifying the music cinematography makeup design everyone did an outstanding job to deliver masterclass of movie this isn an action hollywood flick but slow and methodical film that knows what it is and doesn try to be any of the previous batmans it hard to compare the batman and the dark knight as they are two very different movies following the same vigilante both are amazing in their own right but must say excited to see where this new take on batman will go from here as stated in the title card was overly excited for this take on the batman everything looked amazing and not just fresh coat of paint of the similar traits we have seen before this is new direction for the dc universe just like the joker back in 2019 to me it really delivered and it was an amazing experience one not easily forgotten 101.0\tas fan of this character for well over 40 years confess to arriving more with hope then anticipation to see this movie the reality is was ecstatic by the end ve always been lover of the darker gritty side of the character and pattinson delivers this in spades here ably supported by stellar supporting cast this has wonderfully gothic gritty feel about it with haunting beautiful score clearly this is more case of batman trying to figure out how to be bruce wayne rather then the opposite scenario he clearly consumed by vengeance and is at times reckless and makes mistakes the potential going forward for character development here is massive and for one can wait to see this my only gripe here is that love to have seen more of andy serkis as alfred for now we have an intriguing appetiser which sure will be built on in the future always leave the audience wanting more they say well can wait for the next installment congratulations to all involved1.0\thad it came before the christopher nolan and christian bale batman trilogy it could had been the best batman movie ever made but now after experiencing what director can do with batman as character which christopher nolan showed in his trilogy think this movie didn excite me that much the director tried his best but couldn reach that finnes of nolan still star for trying hard hope the next batman movie would surpass all our expectations best of luck1.0\tthis is movie where batman bruce wayne is still young and trying to find his place in the gotham society the movie is hours long and feels like crime mystery drama with some action the action is not as much as like it to be but just the right amount like pinch of salt in your favourite soup not too much and not too little it movie where you ll see batman learns from mistakes and grows as he unravels riddler riddles it fun hunt make sure you empty your bladder before going in this movie is long and it does feel long1.0\twasn expecting much but it had me hooked from beginning to end very good plot glad it not just another action superhero movie enjoyed every minute of it congratulations to the team behind this one awesome job1.0\tthis is the perfect batman movie writing acting action story everything was perfect you are doing yourself disservice if you don see it on the big screen1.0\tthis movie had amazing action sequences but incorporated far more mysterious aspect as it revealed batman detective side the movie was one giant riddle and the audience got to watch it all play out0.0\twanted to like this am huge batman fan and read the comics own all the movies and even the old tv shows etc so maybe that is why was so excited with this but this movie is dud mean with so much capital to play on it is simply boring compare the acting in this with any version you like and it is downgrade my wife got three hour nap out of it but this is an embarrassing presentation off phenomenal character1.0\tif you were looking for hokey or cheesy superhero film you will be massively disappointed in the batman the cast costumes writing and cinematography of the batman are all absolutely spot on the dark gritty film noir of this movie draws you in and keeps you hooked you will not be disappointed in this incarnation of batman0.0\tthe whole movie is just damn joke it was so unintentionally funny that laughed more than once mostly the masks and costumes nailed it but the end did it aswell it was just bad1.0\tlove the riddler dude ve always loved the riddler who doesn he finally back and he riddling the riddler is riddling away he got riddles batman has to solve those riddles in order to keep the crimes away but can he out riddle the riddler you ll have to watch the movie to solve that one wink the only things didn really care for were the batman catwoman romance as never like that and the slightly confusing crime syndicate plot but when the riddler riddles hoo boy that riddle of time see the movie1.0\tthe batman is the best comic movie of all time the plot is amazing the acting is incredible the cinematography is beautiful and absolutely loved robert pattinson and paul dano in this film1.0\tthis movie was put to very high standards and it achieved that and more the cinematography the acting the character development and the score were all fantastic was questioning whether the dynamic between the riddler and batman would be cheesy and forced but it felt like true hero vs villain dynamic this is must watch movie1.0\tthis franchise never cease to amaze me that how they are still the best movies every time they release the new one in this batman is even more realistic he is agile but vulnerable even some ordinary street thugs can knock him out but then he gets back up storyline is one of he best like the riddler character looks innocent yet dangerous and psychopath0.0\twonderful cast that just seemed little lackluster there was lack of chemistry and the movie was trying little too hard to be melodramatic darkened cinematography can be overdone which this was1.0\tit hard to imagine within span of years we ve gotten joker and batman stand alone films that have come close or even stood up equally to the dark knight but here we are after what seems like lifetime of delays the batman is finally here in all its brutal glory of course matt reeves used his keen eye for atmosphere and intensity to create gotham city environment even more ruthless and ignited than we ve seen before he also sought out to choose batman bruce wayne unlike we ve seen before one that shows raw emotions of grief and pure unbridled rage toward criminal scum he found gem in robert pattinson who has proved naysayers completely wrong with his insanely unique portrayal of the bat with riveting premise focusing around corruption greed and terror within gotham the story never lets up and continues to build momentum that leads to an absolute ballistic conclusion the film has such versatile feel to it as well at times it an action full of well choreographed fights and gunfire other times it pulse pounding suspenseful thriller sometimes it an emotional drama diving deep into the characters but the most welcomed theme is bits of horror aspects that no batman film has had until this one it fits so well with the overall ambience the acting is top notch and with cast like that you re not expecting anything less as mentioned earlier pattinson is superb dano is decrepit and psychotically brilliant john turturro is brilliant as carmine falcone serkis is so cool as alfred saarsgard and wright are great but the one who steals the show imo is colin farrell penguin portrayal which may be up for an oscar if had my way he absolutely iconic and hilariously dangerous his prosthetics are uncannily perfect and wears it so well zoe kravitz is also solid getting into the visuals and sonic aspects it everything you want and more for gotham illuminated vibrant colors and perfectly executed themes all over probably the most pleasing visual film so far of any batman the soundtrack is phenomenal and keeps the films pace going all in all expected to love this film but didn expect it to be my new favorite batman movie it hits on all levels and never lets up it easy to be absorbed with hype but truly think this is the most complete and unique batman film so far which is tall order considering the tdk trilogy from nolan if you have any doubts about pattinson prepare to be blown away cannot wait to see the sequels which will expand this version of the bat and his villains even more1.0\tjust came back from the cinema and what can say about this masterpiece absolutely perfect pattinson became the hero that we don deserve but we need and he showed that batman is bruce wayne and not bruce wayne is batman surrounded by marvellous cast zoe cravitz rocks as catwoman and the chemistry between hers and roberts is wonderful paul dano proves what talented actor he is by bringing on the screen horrifying mysterious crazy riddler big shout out to jeffrey wright colin farell andy sherkis for the amazing performances matt reeves delivers the cruelty of the world through the movie the riddler is the result of the society don want to say something more just one more thing you might love this movie you might not because it dark realistic and hard but you can deny one think that this movie is good movie1.0\texquisitely directed extremely engaging and constantly thrilling this might be the best live action batman movie ever robert pattinson was great as batman easily becoming my new favorite and paul dano was very entertaining 10 101.0\tone of the only hour movies didn find obnoxious was with it and understood almost every scene the producers could ve cut around 10 minutes from the beginning of the movie but they did not help or hurt the movie the cinematics and camera work were all top tier and kept me invested the whole time great story characters and plot1.0\tdefinitely more human batman not the great super hero we ve all come to know in movies he in conflict with his own existence and with what he has become this not easy to pull off yet it is very well executed film the dark atmosphere of the movie keeps you in suspense from start to end this is actually the most outstanding aspect of the movie can see more films coming with the same theme1.0\tthis is what imagined my batman to be comic book accurate real and believable dark and gritty most importantly it focuses on batman being detective it also shows that batman is in his second year and still learning while experiencing matt and his team should be proud no flaws just pure art and cinema not like other bad movies that only seek your money1.0\tthis was the first time got to watch batman movie in cinemas yeah didn get to watch even the dark knight trilogy until was old enough and absolutely enjoyed it never expected robert pattinson to be such good batman bruce wayne he surpassed the expectations had and quickly became one of my favorite batman actors as watched him deliver knockout performance also loved zoë kravitz her performance and charisma backed her role perfectly this film managed to strike the perfect balance between batman as superhero and as detective the film progresses at good pace in the first half the action scenes and the riddles keep you intrigued while setting up higher expectations from the second half which are ultimately achieved even though some might find it lengthier towards the final act but then again the storytelling is really good and the climax epilogue are delivered well this movie is mostly about batman as detective and fighter but at the end of the day it doesn forget to honor his reputation as what he truly is hero superhero the action sequences are fantastic and intense the background score made the experience more and more immersive the cinematography and visuals looked picturesque with its writing acting and technical aspects nailed perfectly the batman delivers fresh take on the caped crusader and that is something his fans are bound to love even though the occasional pacing issues might hurt here and there this is film that deserves to be seen whether or not you like superhero films in general if you love even just simple action drama you might love watching it1.0\treally wasn sure whether robert pattinson could pull this off he managed to merge bruce wayne as shy and reclusive haunted man with the epitome of vengeance so well that wasn shocked when riddler pointed out that bruce wayne was the mask not the other way around the 68 charger is by far the most interesting version of the batmobile so far half mad max half iconic batmobile from michael keaton days it just beast the bat and cat relationship was well done zoe kravitz sold catwoman incredibly well with the exception of her covid style face covering selina was always bruce go to partner and their dynamic has always been interesting introducing her familial structure to the story not only gave her character weight but was hat tip to the canon character storyline and well done the only real complaint found was that most interesting villain scene was the joker and it was removed from the film and posted online by the director now there is someone story would have preferred to see and not have it alluded to as happening in the first year of the caped crusaders journey really hope that he is in the next one and there will be next one with pattinson of that am sure1.0\tgive it stars for the new approach of telling us the story of batman again from new perspective young batman excellent villains memorable characters good situations and what love the most is seeing detective atmosphere sinister but fresh they must have delved into that section of dark detective funeral dark outside with better results it is very good movie however it lacked an essence that would mark that this would be masterpiece it lacked lot lot to rise to its previous movies but it fine1.0\tthe batman is film with an awful lot going on it an anguished character study serial killer crime story political conspiracy thriller about the legacy of lies love story between the bat and the cat year two batman tale as well as an origin story for multiple bat villains selina kyle has similarly crucial role to play as she conducts her own missing person investigation in parallel with batman puzzle quest it compelling enough alliance of convenience but the shift into love story territory never truly convinces and while kravitz is physically adept catwoman one whose speed and agility makes up for what she may lack in stature it not an especially interesting or revolutionary take on character who has already been realized exceedingly well on screen across multiple iterations gotham itself is beautifully believable creation grounded but grand take on familiar locale seamlessly stitched together with atmospheric location work and flawless visual effects robert pattinson is terrific as young brooding batman bruce wayne narrating his story in hard bitten style that clearly influenced by the 1940 film noir style it dark it brutal there no humor or lightness in the new footage it basically looks like horror movie with scope and scale feel the pg13 rating would have been better served as hard it time batman got proper rated movie like rated the suicide squad was better and it flopped hard so safety in the teen numbers suppose as numbers show that pg and pg 13 films gross roughly twice what rated films do with all this said this is still creeping angry white knuckle inducing psychological thriller with heavy dose of crime noir thriller entirely different from the others in the live action canon yet surprisingly loyal to gotham lore as whole good film and much better than was expecting the batman has been well received by critics and earned an cinemascore from audiences as well as strong posttrack exit scores grossing hefty 57 million from 417 locations in its opening day will definitely help box office recovery which is very good for cinema1.0\tthis film was brilliant from start to finish the cast was great it didn drag the story was dark and pattinson was incredible batman genuinely have nothing bad to say about this film really hope there are more films from matt reeves and pattinson as batman my only worry is that wb will push for 12a for the next film this was dark and needs to stay dark sorry kids but this one is for the grown ups1.0\tit only been day since the batman is out and obviously the general audience have yet to settle down on their opinions of the movie but as of now the response is overwhelming praise and get it the movie is really good but is it the best batman movie ever made don think so matt reeves the batman has very grounded approach to its version of the caped crusader batman who also has subconscious sadistic tendency toll his life as the masked vigilante has taken on him this movie also introduced many interesting aspects about the bruce wayne batman dynamic which definitely made things so much interesting but where this movie falls short is its villain paul dano does great job as the riddler but feel like his character wasn written to its fullest potential there was so much hype throughout the movie regarding what the riddler plan was but when his masterplan was finally revealed it just seemed so stale it felt like all those clues riddles and everything the writers were throwing at us up to that point didn justify what it resolved and that my biggest complaint this doesn make it bad movie in any way nor does it make it masterpiece as so many are saying we re still in week remember it certainly was enjoyable and if you wanna check it out you definitely should go watch it in theatres1.0\tas huge batman fan was extremely excited for this film release and must say was not disappointed the whole cast is brilliant and the score really adds to the tone of the movie gotham itself is arguably the best live action representation we have seen of the iconic fictional city also think reeves absolutely nails the detective aspect of batman which is exciting to me as we haven seen this side of the character in live action until now the take on the riddler is fresh and original and far better than jim carrey campy and over the top portrayal in batman forever with all this being said there are some contrivances with this film at times batman appears to be near invincible as he tanks gunshots multiple times throughout the movie in fairness this can be debunked by the armoured nature of this batsuit the whole third act can feel tacked on considering the film had reached it climax before then however it does do good job of characterising this batman and setting up the sequel this film is excellent highly recommend for most batman fans if the 1966 tv series and schumacher batman films are more your style however wouldn feel pressured to watch as this film is intense and has the grittiest tone for any superhero movie ve seen1.0\tcity that looks and feels like city violence that feels violent and characters with something going on behind their masks most of all it makes you realise how truly dreadful the previous few outings were1.0\tdirected by matt reeves starring robert pattinson as bruce wayne batman zoe kravitz as selina kyle catwoman jeffery wright as lt james gordon collin farrell as oz penguin paul dano as the riddler john turturro as carmine falcone andy serkis as alfred and peter sarsgard as district attorney of gotham well around cast of seasoned actors the batman is the latest adaptation of the classic super hero batman in this reboot robert pattinson is picking up the mantle of the famed vigilante only in year two of bruce wayne being batman he been trying to clean up the streets of gotham with his only real allie lt james gordon after string of high profile murders have been happening batman will have to get some more allies to help figure out this new foe which seems to be crazy but also highly intelligent with master plan to tear down all of gotham with back drop of lot of potential villains in this film the true villain is the riddler batman must put his detective skills to the test to figure out who this mad man is in the process making frenemy in selina kyle catwoman who is also effected by these string of crimes during this process batman must weed through the gangsters and crooked politicians to find out who the riddler is during this process no one will go unscathed including bruce wayne this film was originally supposed to be written directed and starred in by ben affleck even though he originally said yes to the tall task it eventually posed to be to much for ben rather than more responsibilities with the franchise he actually wanted less and eventually stepped away fully from the franchise altogether thus matt reeves picking up the mantle and robert pattinson taking the lead role of batman like to call him emo batman or as my nephew would call him teen vogue batman as director and writer ben affleck is the man he written and directed some really good films would of loved to see him direct and write this and just give the acting to someone else that water under the bridge now though matt reeves did an excellent job this film was griddy and very dark visually amazing he definitely knows how to shoot film the first fifteen minutes really set this film up cinematography was great with perfect musical score that being said it was extremely to long they re lot of scenes they could of edited down this film should of been like batman begins hours and 20 mins then go up from there as needed even dark knight rises was little shorter than this film went back to watch the dark knight and the feeling that film gave me didn get with the batman but will say this was completely different take on batman robert pattinson was better than thought he would be but he was still little to emo for me michael keaton is my favorite batman of all time followed right by christian bale this film was really good and went above my expectations the time line was confusing me bit this was year two of bruce wayne being batman he had those black mirror eye cameras but then his bat mobile was supped up charger so was litttle lost on the actual era of when this was some gadgets were advanced and others fit perfectly for year two of being batman it brought little confusion even though the film was extremely dark and the visuals were still great do wish we got little more daylight in the film robert pattinson wasn the worst batman but middle tier in my opinion wish we got more of andy serkis being alferd it was kind of disservice to have that great of an actor for so little scenes he did have powerful scene but robert as bruce wayne kind of sucked the energy out of that scene robert didn give much to that side of the coin he was emo bruce wayne for sure they allude to joker for the next film and going to say it right now jack nicholson and heath ledger cemented that role won lie joaquin phoenix killed it in his film but unless they are bringing him in to do it don want to see another actor attempt it can finish this review without giving zoe kravitz her praise she killed it as catwoman the personality plus her agility and fighting skills were spot on collin ferrel as the penguin was good different take on him being more of mobster but liked the angle they took paul dano as the riddler was interesting he played it well but as you got to dive into that character more he might of been little to nutty for me overall it was long dark and grungy film with batman being true detective trying to find his way dealing with an unusual foe in just year two of being batman give the batman four mor fires cosmoandthemoviewithin cosmomovieblog cosmolanier thebatman1.0\tdo you like 2022 batman their prior work was little too new wave for my tastes but when christian bale came out in 06 think they really came into their own commercially and artistically the whole movie has clear crisp plot and new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the viewers big boost he been compared to moon night but think batman has far more bitter cynical sense of vengeance in 22 dc released this the batman their most anticipated movie think their undisputed masterpiece is the joker movie so iconic most people probably don listen to the plot but they should because it not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends it also personal statement about the director itself hey bruce1.0\tmr pattinson good act made very character batman with this film saw the multiple sides of person who become one of the famous dc the sad the lonely the vegeance person became the fighter and the hero of all gotham people0.0\tthanks be no idea where these reviews have came from anyone rating this above has lost there mind boring long winded in no way offensive on any level easy to predict absolute waste of time the music was overdone exaggerated where it didn need to be very strange film indeed went in with no expectations but extremely excited to see this version of batman what let down this was not fun interesting exciting upbeat there was absolutely no rhythm ve no real qualms with the actors though away to google the director pretty sure they will have pronouns and be gender neutral and love protest about people hurting the feelings of the blades of across as they walk across them disappointed1.0\tbatman fan and want to see this movie about years this is real batman not like the others batman the story was so nice want to see second part for this movie pattinson is one of the best batman anyone should watch it1.0\t10 zoë kravitz makes for the best catwoman to date but the hype far outweighed the end product in this overly dark technically sound but not so mysterious hour slog that could have been much more efficient and even more entertaining1.0\thave watched this times and each time liked it more than the last time batman have never looked this great in live action movie the cinematography is so damnnn good can wait to see what next to come from this trilogy hopefully we get to see the next one soon1.0\ttoo long can be hours it draws from the dark animated batman tas series liked as teen the 3h movie length is not realistic the ridler is too dark for my taste1.0\tenjoyed many aspects of the film but also found it missing epic oooo awww moments think every hero genre film should have saving martha quality fight sequences following that masterpiece scene this one was in choreography but had good depth in character development story was left feeling unfulfilled we have seen enough batman films to know what we want need good story attention to detail saving martha level fight choreography costume visuals ignoring the blueprint is recipe for disaster this was good decent intro to the robert bat with potential for great sequels if recipe is followed 10 promising future0.0\tbatman is basically an emo soyboy this movie focuses on blm and white man bad not against adding african american characters but since when was commissioner gordon black sadly this movie belongs in the trash could have been good but just hours of wokeness1.0\thave to admit was quite skeptical about pattinson playing the batman but boooi did he prove me wrong he was amazing and so was every other actor in the film was shocked to see alex ferns in this film the most kept wondering where have seen this actor then realised omg he was trevor in eastenders and later remembered he was also in chernobyl the film as whole was brilliant very gritty lot darker than all the previous batman films zoe kravitz played catwoman perfectly michelle pheiffer has been my most favourite catwoman ever but have to say kravitz was amazing in the new batman would definitely watch the whole film again right now1.0\tpattinson didn convince me as bruce wayne but he is perfect as the batman the whole plot is so well written that it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first minute the whole this is visual masterpiece that makes this the best superhero movie in while and the soundtrack my god amazing1.0\tthe bgm and action scenes limited ones are great bats played by rob pat has very different feel and feels fresh only factor that bothered was why couldn the duration been shorter0.0\tthe forest half was kind of ok but the second half just could not wait for it to end torture everything was super predictable and boring the villains were not the slightest scary many pointless repetitive scenes they said oh my god or jesus about 100 times0.0\tthis isn batman absolutely the worst batman ever fact just complete mess do not waste your money watch the christian bale trilogy and be happier and have money in your pockets0.0\twent to see this film and was really looking forward to it but it was absolutely rubbish there was no sci fi aspects and the only resembling batman was the fact that he wore the suit otherwise you would just think it was gangster movie also the film was hours long far too long with no special effects very dark and depressing would certainly not recommend and it one of the worst films have ever seen total disappointment1.0\tits how batman should look and feel dark was coming to the cinema with low expetations but was glued to my chair just watch it some say it is abit long but for me it could have been longer1.0\tthis is movie is so dark yet so scintillating marvelous and brilliant great detective movie it shows batman in his early days who struggles not so high tech devices but yet so effective must watch would be disappointed if not winning the oscar this year if not atleast gets nominated for oscars1.0\tvery good version of the dc series robert patinson equips himself well as batman better than thought he would be long film but the time soon went strong storyline with sly one liners darker then even the michael keaton version interesting to see if they can follow this up with strong sequel1.0\tin the batman the performances soundtrack dark tone and atmosphere story production value lighting visual and sound effects and cinematography all deserve all praise they are made with all passion and love but regarding the flaws what criticize in the batman is the 176 runtime direction and screenplay and the action sequences when it comes to the runtime the movie was very long it would have been better if the movie had been for instance 130 minutes long also considering the action scenes expected that the movie will have more exciting and adrenaline boosting action scenes but unfortunately it didn but this does not mean that didn like the batman on the contrary enjoyed it and am excited for the sequels in the future if there are ones when it comes to the score give the batman out of 101.0\teveryone should be hype for this cuz literaly this movie was lit robert really play both characters so good as batman bruce wayne and didn expect that this is gonna be my new fav movie thx to matt reeves1.0\treally enjoyed every minute of this film this is my kind of batman nolan dark knight trilogy has been big part of my childhood has left in me an impact as cinephile every character here are in their own way broken the direction is so beautiful and intense the script has many layers and all the actors give flawless performances the batman is definitely one of my new all time favorites0.0\twas disappointed at every level apart from music and photography what type of movie was this action not really romantic close but nope thriller tried but nope buffer by good reviews1.0\tthere can be no argument about robert pattinson acting in this film he is spectacular fantastic and perfect his voice makeup costume hair walk action everything is beyond description talking about catwoman zoé kravitz nailed it she is the best catwoman in the dc history for sure alfred is outstanding loved the penguin don wanna talk about villains no spoilers but what love the most was the music in any superhero movie same kinda music is going on but this year it completely outshining all other circumstances this music is unforgettable finally that would be loss if you don watch it in the hall thanks1.0\twell pattinson is still bit skinny for batman but he did pretty good was not sure about this one and the running time is 3h it was bit of new start for batman and not the same story etc lots of potential for another movie0.0\tdon know why everyone is raving over this movie even if they were trying to do something different with this batman film it falls short in so many ways and is yet another example of why films in the last years have really missed the mark pattinson fails to be dynamic witty batman and instead is somber moody character who fails to create any sort of emotion or like ability with the viewer commissioner gordon also fails to make an impression with very limited and poor dialogue throughout the mafia mob aspect of this movie is also very poorly done with it almost coming across as godfather spoof movie with the overt stereotypical mafia accents and shotty acting honesty there was not one memorable or dynamic scene in this movie and simply isn even in the ball park of the greatness of the dark night or micheal keatons batman know they were trying different approach with this movie but they failed at every turn wake up people1.0\tthis was dark gritty brutal batman the movie was shot perfectly omg the music score was beautiful and every lived the best mobile lived the suit live zoe as cartman1.0\twow loved this movie so much so many comic book references gotham never looked better in any batman film pure noir detective film if you haven read any batman comics before the batman recommend you to read the long halloween year one zero year ego and dark victory think those are the ones that the movie was inspired by 10 101.0\tthebatman will become one of the best comic book movies in long time the text performances set pieces and visual storytelling were exceptional robert pattinson stars as the sentimental batman alongside paul dano scary riddler matt reeves modern masterpiece1.0\tmy favourite part about this movie is the new world they ve painted for batman and the different kind of characterization they choose to mould pattinson take on bruce wayne if you thought nolan world was ultra realistic and gritty reeves kicks things up another notch this world is captured through some great work from grieg fraser in the cinematography the movie doesn paint any illusions about the state of gotham some of the dingy environments looked like their ripped right out of david fincher movie and it really grounds you from any notion of false hope that things are just going to work out for our intrepid heroes the excellent camera work carries over into the action scenes they re extremely well shot the focus is less on extensive choreography and more on efficiency and brutality there fight in hallway where the only light is provided by firing guns that exciting and underscores the dramatic tension visually the movie checks all the boxes and helps differentiate the batman from previous efforts ve said in several of my previous reviews that want more personable and grounded superhero stories instead of the same old sky beam and threat to the planet give me fully realized and relatable villain with good reason to despise our hero eg an unstoppable force meets the immovable object the batman goes this route and it better movie for it we get some great insight into the riddler the payoff with his character is impressive and some of the scenes near the end while he explaining himself are pretty chilling we also get more ground level story about corruption in the city and the mob role in local politics it not only lends to the realistic feel but it just as effective in getting us to care about the characters take that over the planet potentially exploding any day in the week was pretty skeptical of robert pattinson being cast as bruce wayne batman he been indie favourite for years now he successfully rehabbed his career and while it was nice to see him get shot with big project wasn sure if this was the best casting he proved me wrong as batman his growl is appropriate and he able to wear the suit and look the part so no complaints that way but as much as wanted to be fully on board with his portrayal his bruce wayne is pretty dismal get that part of his version of wayne is that he doesn care about projecting success or fitting in as billionaire but when he forced to appear as his alter ego he can even act like human being he looks like an alien trying to understand why people act how they do and while that definitely choice it was jarring to me the rest of the movie is well cast zoe kravitz is nice fit as selina kyle she brings her own flavour to it and while her character romantic chemistry with batman doesn quite gel she good on her own wish the plot had devoted more time to her friendship with annika so we could have gotten more insight into her current state of mind also wish we got more of colin farrell as oz like farrell so much more when he not trying to be an action hero his makeup is good and while he great in supporting part here his portrayal of the penguin could carry movie by itself he sneering and barking his way through the runt ime and liked that they toned down the more cartoonish elements of the character was little split on dano performance as the riddler didn find him as frightening or harrowing as the movie wanted him to be while he perpetrating his reign of terror but when dano gets to take off the mask he fantastic really liked his scenes where he squaring off with batman as edward ashton it was good reminder that dano an oscar nominated performer who better in his big budget work than he given credit for jeffery wright is always welcome addition and liked him as jim gordon he works well with pattinson wish he was given little more individuality or room to move around in the character he relegated to largely just defending or agreeing with batman lastly really enjoyed john tuturro performance as carmine falcone when saw him for the first time in the movie thought he might go way too big but he pretty restrained he wonderful actor check him out in the night of he amazing in that series and he gets the job done without laying it on too thick there lots to love in this film can remember the last time walked out of the theatre so conflicted about movie but there was plenty of aspects that stuck in my craw the first is that while they chose different route for the character they chose to portray him as more of noir detective than grizzled superhero that great love well made film noir but batman is terrible detective in this movie other than the one off riddles he solves almost nothing without tripping over his own feet having someone else do part of the work alfred jim and selina or just missing the point entirely he the world greatest detective why is he one step behind every other character in this movie the physics in the action scenes change constantly how did oz car get away from the batmobile with the amount of raw power in it and while the movie got long run time some of the character arcs are just forced to wrap up at the end we get sweet moment between bruce and alfred but bruce has just snapped at alfred and treats him like an inferior most of the film the burgeoning romantic element between batman and catwoman is pretty half baked we don get any kind of resolution about bruce feelings regarding thomas and martha and oz never gets to assert his authority even though the ending does imply it coming soon the movie is also littered with small plotholes but also admit that few are them are that noticeable despite having some reservations think matt reeve deserves lot of credit for doing what he can to re invent the iconic caped crusader and delivering new experience for his viewers really like to see sequel but want to see this one again just to have another chance for it to really sink in it does run long but there are couple of effective twists in the end there could have been tighter edit but there so much packed into it that can be too critical the batman delivers memorable standalone adventure that should be celebrated for going its own way and bucking so many tired cliches from the genre recommend seeing it in theatre and although wasn 100 on board for all of the batman hope you enjoy it at least as much as did1.0\tthe best batman movie ever released in every way every filmography in the batman is well constructed and the montage manages to hold us for almost hours with mysteries that are unraveled in sequence rob is committed to the role reinforcing my main idea that he would be the best interpretation of the bat1.0\tbatman has gone through lot of big screen iterations throughout the years and pleased to report that this interpretation is solid this is comic book movie that doesn really feel like comic book film which can see it turning some fans off would compare the feeling of the film to 2019 joker it is long and certainly felt the length 15 20 minutes easily could have been cut there were moments where thought the film would end but didn and despite its long runtime was never bored hard to say which parts would have cut out because things did move organically but did feel some of the catwoman subplot involving carmine falcone played by john turturro kinda stretched out the film bit longer than it should have while totally accurate to the source material and develops catwoman felt that was the only part of the film that felt the film mildly dragged robert pattinson portrayal of bruce wayne comes off with lot of angst but in good way this is batman in his second year and he socially awkward he more comfortable operating in the shadows night wearing the cape and the cowl over just being bruce wayne think he will eventually grow into the bruce wayne we re familiar who is in the spotlight and comes off as playboy as the films progress without spoilers did feel reveal about bruce family specifically regarding his mother kinda fell little flat given that the waynes are public figure felt the information given about his mom should have been information that would not be hidden if you get what mean it was the only part of the film questioned by far this is the best detective batman film up until now nolan and bale showcased the detective side of batman more than previous incarnations in their trilogy but director matt reeves dials up the detective noir element by 100 jim gordon played by the amazing jeffery wright is the mvp his working relationship with batman are the best parts of the film as they solve the riddles and murders together paul dano riddler is effective and creepy very zodiac killer inspired lots of disturbing imagery his motive is quite effective and he is true to his convictions zoe kravitz isn too shabby as catwoman and colin farrel is totally unrecognizable as the penguin andy serkis alfred is also highlight alfred and bruce dynamic is bit different as it kinda hostile but it clear bruce knows alfred is the only connection to humanity he has we saw hints of that in snyder bvs but think their hostile yet kinda tender relationship is bit more fleshed out here aside from the batmobile chase scene the action scenes aren mind blowing but they have this visceral gritty feel you can feel the hits batman takes as he fighting thugs so he not as impervious which only reinforces him still being rookie as comic book fan loved that reeves clearly took some inspiration of the long halloween and dark victory splash of year one and no man land as well want to also add that this gotham felt like an actual character real crappy place to live in overall went in with lot of bias because what truly desired was the solo ben affleck batman film that desperately wanted reeves and pattinson won me over would like to also add that pattinson batman voice is far better than bale the tone of the film won me over would argue this is bit darker than what nolan did pattinson doesn take the top spot as the best batman that still belongs to affleck for me but he absolutely delivers 101.0\tit was bit weird seeing pattinson as batman guess he not the handsome rich superhero type of guy after watching the movie think he kinda nailed it he was good fit in this dark and depressing movie for those who saying that this movie sucks because it too depressive and dark suggest watching the avengers cringe fest of jokes and clichés all of them are weightless comedy since captain america winter soldier think that superhero life can be an endless grind of saving the world and serving justice let not forget about that bruce wayne is man without super powers he can have the same feelings like the people in gotham city how would you feel yourself in crime infested city where you can be beaten down in any second just as you have seen in this movie not trying to say that they couldn enjoy life when they are not fighting but come on making jokes in the middle of war and key moments it really dumb think sorry for being too long sure that many of you will downvote me but accept your opinion wish that everyone finds their joy in today movies as found in the batman see you1.0\tfirst the bad stuff worst batman haircut ever also robert pattinson is way too skinny for batman you could compare him to christian bale as he was playing the mechanic also very annoying too many characters keep explaining their motivations and predictable actions other than that solid performance by rb also his portrayal of batman has room to grow riddler gordon and catwoman are awesome never would never have guessed that the penguin is played by colin farrell mask department did great wanna see what happens next and get rb haircut all in all bit long lots of snowflake blah blah nice car too much eyeliner bad hair day week ever worth the time fun enough0.0\thad high hopes for this movie after joker figured this is movie that will lead into each other honestly found this movie to be boring from the word go it was too dark and hard to see anything all the actors were emotionally empty the plot was just thin and bland my wife fell asleep after about an hour we ended up leaving an hour and half into it because it was just so so boring there were only two scenes that had any action at all car crashing into funeral and chase that lasted about minutes that about it in my opinion worse batman movie made since the george clooney days what waste of 601.0\tit more like pg 13 detective thriller than comic book movie adaptation of batman so laughed in the theatre few times because guy in bat suit was trying to solve crime with police officers but other than that it reminded me lot like se7en with brad pitt how you don really see much of the riddler until really the end like john doe in se7en0.0\ttotally money waste totally time waste average action average story movie run time is very lengthy suggest other people don watch this movie in theatre average batman acting1.0\the wasn unstoppable he was clumsy when base jumping or using the grappling hook to fly through windows it was cool take on year batman the fight scenes were fast paced and well choreographed it slow burner but in good way it had true detective vibe great hbo show also reminded me alot of the crow movies which is good thing we haven seen that style in while gave it out of 10 because of one line that ripped you out of your trip to gotham and and made you think about current events and everything outside of the big screen not good move if you want movie to age well but at least they got right back on track can wait to see sequel with upgraded suits for the bat and cat hoping for the catwoman with goggles from hush maybe batman can build them for her1.0\tlove this movie love the acting and it was great but it felt dull and weird at some parts but loved the darkness and mysterious movie something ve never seen in batman movie but love it1.0\ttoo realistic to be true amazing work of matt reeves sound effects performances action etc will wait for the sequel and maybe more villains to come1.0\tthe batman is hour long masterpiece filled with stunning visuals tightly wound story an amazing score and most of all great acting each character has his moment in the limelight the batman is fever dream for comic book fans and movie buffs the movie has its own identity ever after plethora of inspirations to bring life to the bleak and cesspool of gotham to sum up this movie does not disappoint it delivers the most authentic batman experience to date0.0\tsame old psychopath villian same old story nothing new it more like detective movie than superhero movie hours long boring same wine in new bottle1.0\tthis movie is masterpiece everything from the look of gotham which to me kinda resembles gotham city from batman arkham knight as well as joaquin phoenix joker movie to the atmosphere to the characters and to the story everything about this movie is just perfect for those who think the dark knight is on par with the batman your an idiot the batman blows that trashy nolan movie out of the water the riddler in this movie oh boy this version is not only psychotic and creepy but he can be damn well terrifying at times hell during the opening scene which involved riddler stalking breaking in and killing his first victim and the way he did while screaming sent chills down my spine paul dano did an awesome job not only breathing new life into the character but make so dark and twisted plus it helped that this version of riddler is sort of based on the infamous zodiac killer robert pattinson loved his take kinda reminded me of young keaton batman in terms of him being recluse to the people of gotham dark and brooding however with pattinson batman he has strict no killing policy as his batman contends with unravelling riddler twisted games and murders to expose all the corruption within gotham government from the police to the politicians involving his own father he is wondering if maybe gotham isn worth saving and batman isn needed but he continues to fight on seeing the good in people not abandoning gotham and always being there to protect the people because it the right thing to do believe me when say this is the darkest batman movie yet it darker than tim burton batman movies the entire story is deep as it is compelling and this movie isn too long either 173 minutes is the perfect run time to introduce and have us as the audience spend time to get to know these versions of the characters1.0\twhats not to like the movie was amazing totally epic way better than the dark knight which lets be honest only gets praised so high becuase of heath ledger the only only thing about this movie didnt like was the missed opportunity do connect it to the joker movie it would of fit so perfectly but eah oh well0.0\ttruly one of the worst movie have seen in years every scene drug on and on the entire film should have been an hour and half shorter there was no chemistry way to much forced artsy drama corny predictable scene after scene unnecessary dialogue the list goes on the entire film screams at the top of its lungs trying way to hard it truly truly just sucked no actual drama terrible scenes that you just want to end but never do if was not with other people we would have left halfway through1.0\tmy most anticipated film of the year this is without doubt the most well made batman film the cinematography by greig fraser who also did the cinematography for dune is absolutely beautiful and euphoric furthermore matt reeves did an excellent job with the direction which we have seen before in his planet of the apes trilogy this film takes lots of inspiration from many mystery thrillers like se7en zodiac prisoners etc you can tell that everyone involved in the making of this film was giving it their all so they could make the best batman film possible robert pattinson who continues to be one of the best actors working right now was phenomenal as the caped crusader and is definitely on par with christian bale for my favorite live action batman not to mention zoe kravitz may just be my favorite live action catwoman paul dano was terrifying as the riddler who in this film is very similar to that of the zodiac killer jeffrey wright colin farrell andy serkis and john turturro we re all amazing as well still prefer the dark knight but this is easily my second favorite film in batman catalog1.0\tthis is how wanted batman character to be robert is awesome in the movie got goosebumps during the entry of the dc hero would want to see him in the sequel if there will be any1.0\tthe batman is an absolutely classic movie reckon all warner bros batman animated movies have story pure grit no nonsense and demeanour that batman carries intensifies scene after scene in this movie saw traits of batman the long halloween p1 and batman the hush and am not disregarding the efforts of the team but always wanted that one or may be two animated movies is drawn as feature film the batman does it think all the actors fit in well and have done more than fabulous work you want to know who batman really is see his detective side and observe his grit he rises above all the super heroes you have ever known1.0\twoahh have always been twilight fan but smh was shocked when knew he was about to play on this but yet again was so so impressed by his amazing performance 10 10 loved it1.0\tthe cinematic batman has almost always been mysterious and foreboding no other film franchise has pushed the boundaries of what superhero film can be like batman first evolving the form with tim burton original dark vision then grounding the comic book reality in christopher nolan trilogy and now foregoing many blockbuster trappings altogether in matt reeves superb the batman with each new iteration the goofy superficiality of the comics is stripped away and we re now treated to comic book film which feels nothing like comic book film in fact the batman plays more like an audience pleasing seven with touches of saw thrown in the movie has comic origins but this is straight thriller with brief bursts of meticulous action and it really goddamn cool the film follows batman only two years deep into fighting crime in gotham city he works with lieutenant gordon to fight the local menaces within and soon must solve puzzle orchestrated by the madman riddler to solve the case batman must journey into the heart of gotham digging into its pervasive corruption and exposing the city for its frauds and systemic degradation there lot to love here all of the aesthetic and technical elements of the film work perfectly in tandem while being individual masterstrokes the soundtrack editing character interpretations costuming and gadgets are something out of every batman fan wildest fantasies and lend the film its comic book framework the tone atmosphere and direction all speak to darker mindset dropping batman into bleak grimy crime thriller for the modern age it minute to minute film taking place over the course of only few days while keeping its heroes under perpetual tension and palpable duress the sustainment of intensity is also masterful such tightly controlled films usually lose slack within an hour but the batman is tense and tight until the climax while it doesn quite stick the landing it dynamic gripping routine it also patient meticulous film three hours long but necessarily so fully realized intimate epic while the corruption at the center of the mystery isn particularly surprisingly the film themes of systemic corruption and rot are evergreen and deeply felt today reeves has full control of the film gorgeously opening on premeditated dual setup and instantly evoking sense city wide terror and chaos he knows exactly which details to show in full and which details to omit for maximum engagement he knows how to shoot superhero action too every action sequence is either an uncut take of breathtaking clarity or mix of mounted camera perspectives which greatly enhance the kinetic feeling everything here is practical too it feels real and lived in unlike the majority of blockbusters today that can even bother to feel like two dimensions everything in the batman is the product of singular vision spectacular display of confidence and assured bravado the climax is less singular when it begins the film favored intimacy evaporates and the viewer is left with muddied strobe light action of grander less personal scale there is chase scene which matches the finale spectacle but the chase boasts greater verisimilitude and visual continuity the weakest element of the film is its script which can feel pedestrian and blunt especially compared to the mystery and enigma of the visual landscape the world of the film is heightened and stylized this is not nolan strictly grounded approach and the dialogue sometimes sends the film back to earth fighting against its pervasive starkness in film where every element works in lockstep the few details which don fit stick out like sore thumb there are few of these but the dialogue is the most egregious example another minor but frequent annoyance is lieutenant gordon tendency to repeat what the audience has just been shown again minor but frequent the disjointed climax is less written problem than visual one but there are contradictions in motivations and theme that rub me the wrong way the riddler depicted is force against corruption using horrendous violence to invoke fear and enlighten gotham populace the character works most effectively when viewed through sympathetic lens he reflection of today alienated financially shafted and internally venomous youth his plan to fight against the rich corrupt and unfeeling system makes sense what makes less sense is the final act of his plan which involves mass panic and the killing of thousands of innocent lives his character is suddenly irrationally two faced no pun intended and the film pivots from him being an exactor of specific vengeance to hopelessly lonely mass murderer the simple answer is he just crazy but this is non starter the riddler depicted throughout the film may be mentally unstable but he not irrational he has concrete focused worldview until he doesn more likely is the film brief insistence on underbaked topicality media depictions of domestic terrorism are slowly on the rise and the film climax blindly reflects these depictions without thought to its own fictional context the riddler grand finale is disturbing but it also bafflingly inconsistent and tacked on the cinematography of the film is effective and moody but ludicrously manicured there generous helping of digital gauze slathered onto the film which is both immersive and distracting as mentioned this is not the rigidly grounded style of nolan batman it hyper dark angst ridden always raining world of violence and thuggery and the visual tones reflect such considerations the production and sound designs are also meticulous conveying real world feel in both the dingiest and most luxurious locales rain pours engines rev and the audience is seamlessly sucked into the world special praise must be paid to the soundtrack michael giacchino creates massively epic sonic backbone for the film primarily using only four notes to do so of all the memorable elements of the film and there are many it is the soundtrack that has stayed with me most incessantly there are also two masterfully organic uses of nirvana something in the way hell even the narration fits the film statement only the rarest of films can make the performances pattinson especially are as tightly controlled and deliberate as the rest of the film which sometimes work and sometimes doesn the film has an angsty nihilistic tone but where it counterbalances with electric fight choreography and thundering soundtrack the performances are stuck in one note glumness they re sometimes tuned too far into middle school angst and burdened posturing these decisions work when characters are in the middle of crime scene or the heat of battle and must put on face for the other party but they re less motivated when characters are alone or with trusted friends in short posturing for each other makes sense posturing for the audience not so much not every performer is glum the mafia crowd is lively including chillingly intimidating john turturro and an unrecognizable but gleefully over the top colin farrell paul dano riddler is also menacing equal parts unhinged and shrewdly calculating the correct decision is made not to give dano any sort of physical menace he just guy and bespectacled baby faced one at that the menace is all inside jeffrey wright is likeable and trustable as clean cop keeping stern veneer while delivering some deadpan cracks to keep the engulfing darkness at bay there are actually quite few moments of relative levity filling out the cast andy serkis makes for respectable more physically rugged alfred the details are sparse but one gets the sense that he been much more than butler in his life serving the wayans and his own sense of duty as the circumstances justify the batman lives up to the hype it novel take on the cinematic interpretation of batman full bodied crime thriller which uses the comic book universe as an aesthetic and thematic framework the best comic book films logan the dark knight are those that don feel like comic book films and the batman has inarguably ingrained itself into this pantheon it has like those films and other batman films before it expanded the context of comic book movies delivering lurid dark intelligent product which understands and respects the cinematic medium this isn the breezy assembly line slickness of marvel or the post 11 overkill of the snyderverse this is something altogether different fresh and exhilarating its politics are slightly muddled and it doesn quite stick the landing but the batman did put thought in my head rarely have after leaving movie theater can wait to see the sequel1.0\treally like the fact that this film focuses on batman being the world greatest detective the film is thriller where batman is working with the police albeit uneasily to find the killer of prominent gotham figures reviewing pattinson performance is hard he certainly portrays the tortured vigilante but the playboy bruce wayne is nowhere to be seen he conveys much with his eyes in small flickering glances but never goes beyond that it is subtle performance but somewhat one note the supporting cast are generally excellent with callouts to zoe kravitz jeffrey wright colin farrell hidden under much prosthetics and paul dano on the downside the film is overly long feel it could have been trimmed by about 30 mins without losing plot or character brave new take on the dark knight and will happily go and see sequel0.0\tappreciated the atmosphere it dark and gloomy photography is also very good as the special effects sadly the story is not that interesting there are many subplots that could should be removed the movie is way too long they should have kept it under 2h wasted opportunity1.0\tusually read the user review first before watching any movie in the theater and though there are lots of positive 10 star ratings didn buy it fortunately went to see it myself and boy that was fun ride pattison although lacking as bruce wayne is shockingly very good at being batman not the best batman but his performance is good never really fond of zoe kravitz in her other movies but like her portrayal of catwoman in this people complaining of the gritty dark themes but it is okay for me and it set the tones well for this movie the music is okay but is it just me that whenever the batman comes hummed it to the darth vader theme lol the only thing can complain about is that the 3rd act feels too draggy and long have low expectations of this movie and matt reeves proves me wrong this one is mile better than wonder woman 19840.0\tsoundtracks is reapetable and stressful the villian is bad character while we liked all previeous villians this one is the worst because of no strong personality the batman is kind of wierdo addition of catwoman is the only good thing1.0\tmind blowing cinematography and suited the total dark theme hours was total worth it and robert pattinson what great portrayal kuddos to you highly recommend to watch this man the background score still gives me goosebumps what movie1.0\twith deep admiration for the source material never felt like any live action version of the caped crusader ever fully embodied the character if were to describe my batman it would be the one we see in the arkham series of games there certain feel to those that think just nails the gotham even though they re in arkham experience the trailers gave me hint of hope but still wasn fully convinced at release was being drowned by excessive hype across social media which made me excited but also very nervous that it may not meet my new found expectations was wrong this movie was created with love for the world of batman reeves emphasizes both the physical and mental capabilities of bruce creating the on screen world greatest detective that we were all waiting for pattinson performance only elevates this to new heights ve heard some criticism over his portrayal of wayne but argue it fits into the narrative of rookie style batman that is finally figuring out his role in gotham speaking on gotham the city is given its fair share of characterization as well it shown as the dark corrupt crime ridden underbelly that has allowed it to become so iconic the use of stunning cinematography shines light on the beauty within the chaos the side characters gordon selina penguin etc that fill up this world are also perfect on screen representations each contains small arcs that make them an actual living person rather than just shallow plot device overall was extremely impressed with this film and use that word on purpose majority of the cape movies we watch today lack the subtle world building or attention to detail that makes movie worth that title this takes that step beyond relying on batman alone and chooses to make it cinematic experience think the yin to 2019 joker yang if you re fan of comic book batman this is fresh yet recognizable take that you re sure to enjoy1.0\twatching this film you can easily tell that the cast and the director have done their research by analyzing not just comics but also games and the cons of previous movies it is really dark and deep film while taking its time to establish the world that this batman has to deal with all the cast members understand the characters they re playing and have great chemistry with each other you can have separate comics and spin offs for any of these characters the acting is top notch the soundtrack is inspired by the arkham games darth vader and the animated series and previous films it is absolutely phenomenal and really sets the tone for gotham and the legend of the batman if it wasn obvious from the trailers and clips this movie is also phenomenally directed and shot it really takes its time to showcase the depth and realism in every scene while maintaining steady pace throughout everything is necessary to move the plot till its conclusion this is film that will keep you wanting more even after watching it for hours it also film that will keep surprising you the more times you watch it this combination sets it apart as one of the greatest comic book adaptations to date and easily the best batman movie of all time matt reeves really understands batman unlike anyone who has directed before him if you re batman fan of the movies comics shows and games this movie is guaranteed to keep you wanting more1.0\tgood not great most people will enjoy it but the masses won like it as much as much as the nolan films that being said they are pretty different movies my favourite part of the movie is the cinematography and set design which looked amazing on the imax screen gotham city has never looked so good by that mean gotham looked run down lawless and gloomy the whole film was dark and grounded in sense of realism similar to joker enjoyed almost all of the supporting characters the villains were on point as was professor gordon and catwoman batman was batman for significant part of the movie but instead of spending most of the time fighting he did significant amount of detective work as he is vigilante detective after all pattison was fine as batman the bruce wayne character is hard to judge because it set early in batman career so it very different bruce wayne the movie is hours long that dragged on for lot of people didn necessarily feel that it was too long as enjoyed being in gotham but some parts were definitely slow and the excitement levels weren as consistent as they could have been there are enough things happening to keep you going but most people will feel the hour runtime in one way or another would recommend to fans of thrillers batman and comic book fans but don think it is one that will be on repeat or that will appeal to everybody as much as previous versions1.0\tthe movie is extraordinary in every sense the action the music score the rhythm and the acting is phenomenal in love with robert pattinson and zoe kravitz probably one of the best comic book adaptations ve ever seen it is one of kind experience very glad to have seen it in the first screening in my city1.0\tamazing film pattinson is great as batman and all the cast as well the cinematography and soundtrack are out of this world reeves really made the crime thriller story work it was suspenaeful and exciting from beginning to end loved the aspect of batman needs to learn to become symbol of hope to the citizens and not just be symbol of fear to the criminals his character arc worked for me very well have only one complain the film could have been bit shorter in my opinion towards the end felt the length so think few scenes could have been shortened to ease the runtime overall enjoyed the film very much and can wait for the sequal1.0\twhat an amazing film after nolan success no one knew what matt reeves was planning with this but aproaching batman story from the point where he started being batman and is young and rookie at his job was good decision the story is captivating as the riddler is true threat for the hero and the reasons behind his behavior are part of the gray line the photography and backgrounds are great the movie is full of beautiful scenes with great power in the framing incluiding characters and scenography the only thing that didn love is that it was too long great story absolutely recommend this film0.0\tif you are looking for lot of time to kill and don mind gratuitous violence dark themes and literal darkness filmed with very little light this us the movie for you found the movie to be so slow almost went yo slerp we could have edited out at least 30 min for one didn like robert pattinson as batman bruce wayne he got on my nerves not as bad as the flash guy but close paul dano was good as sadistic killer but thought colin farrell was wasted as the penguin all in all another dark boring batman0.0\tdon understand why they made this movie what waste of time am huge fan of batman but there are so many stories and tell me could batman afford light my goodness and what about the bat mobile my year old could have designed better car yea the guy who played batman was ok but you tell me you could do the death robin where batman almost goes insane now that would have been great movie but no we are stuck with another movie wher we have to listen for crying aloud 3houra or just talking this is not movie for the theatre this is an afternoon tv show0.0\tgot about an hour of the way through this movie as other reviewers have said this is very heavy on the detective work could have sat through that but then batman started arguing with catwoman about her old boyfriend while trying to the cops job coincidentally isn there rule in most police precincts about dating your law enforcement partner and just went ahead and turned the movie off this movie is extremely slow and overall feels awkward 80 of the 700 other reviewers disagree so maybe you will too0.0\tdidn know batman is an emotional gimp beta male well that how he was portrayed if people actually like this batman they must be emotional soy boys1.0\tthe batman is truly the movie the hero deserved which is controversial since didn get this as hero movie and not that it bad thing it was perfect matt reeves works so well in this film that he even jokes about it his mastery of narrative and history is something that feels personal and long standing the dark serious police and dramatic atmosphere of the film does not make it movie to watch once as happened with joker in 2019 although the film presents itself as such the experience here is so satisfying that the almost hours of movie go unnoticed and you end the movie wanting to rewatch it right then and there but let talk about the duo tonico and tinoco from gotham commissioner gordon and batman form police and detective duo with an absurdly well crafted and coherent chemistry the two build the narrative together taking steps together as the mystery is being solved and at the same time escalating into something greater although gordon doesn even know who the madman behind the noir mask is their mutual trust is eye opening across the street selina kyle is also the perfect match for the batman mix of competition romance and camaraderie that works in unique way she likes to see paul dano takes the riddler portrayal of the villain to another level delivering viewers crazy and intelligent maniac at the same time the fact that the antagonist is above the protagonist and the protagonist struggles to reach the final solution and reach him in his attacks transforms the film into masterpiece of films for the genre with large cast of characters matt reeves manages to dominate the satellite cast and deliver depth to all of them in the batman was able to witness one of the best sequences involving car chase in all of cinema an orchestra in the form of scene dc fans have reason to smile this early march matt reeves is the father of cinema robert pattinson is the ultimate batman born to play gotham bat the batman is cinema1.0\thaven been this excited to be comic book fan in while the batman is worth all the hype and wait it is visual masterpiece and amazingly shot film the performances are great robert pattinson and paul dano we re the stand outs for me robert gives amazing performance as both bruce wayne and batman and gives arguably the best portrayal of batman ever while paul dano gives absolutely manic and terrifying performance as the riddler and his performance will keep you on the edge of your seat every time he on screen the story was well told and well paced the dialogue was great and michael giacchino score fits the film perfectly honestly really don have anything else to say just go watch it for yourself or don not the boss of you just sharing my opinion1.0\tget that this is the caped crusader second year in his heroing career but still seeing the world greatest detective being outsmarted and played time and time again feels so weird he weaker and and less energetic compared to the character previous versions so sorry robert love you man but in this case bale version still reign supreme in all aspects alfred is also less than what he supposed to be jeremy irons version is still better and think gordon is too catwoman is fine guess so is falcone and maroni and the greatest casting this movie did goes to both paul dano and collin farrel both really capture the spirit of the characters they play especially the former like something out of the batman arkham game series brought into life the political message delivered so subtly yet doesn go unnoticed even from the first viewing matt you sneaky ard you so there you have it my unpopular opinion though you may still gonna like it even wanna watch it couple of times on the theaters after watching it once but don once is more than enough 100.0\tomg couldn wait for this movie to be over besides george clooney this is the worst batman this version has no personality and is very dark which maybe that was the intent there is no chemistry with catwoman the story is boring and fight scenes are uneventful and riddler doesn even look like the character at least make it look little like the riddler from the comics and paul dano terrible choice and he is good actor too1.0\tthe cast and cinematography were expectedly neat when it comes to new batman can say it my fave or in my top either paul dano stole the show for me he is exceedingly talented the soundtrack is epic runtime could have been shorter solid 10 from my pov also don like that dc keeps creating new universes with every new single movie and then cancels them starts from the beginning here we are with new batman story character and universe what next wonder if this is watch and forget movie universe too1.0\tholy cat truly masterpiece every scene got goosebumps robert batman is whole new level in dc universe and zoe chemistry with him just speechless and can wait so them again robert really proved he is the best batman his voice face movements was just amazing can listen his voice everyday crime and investigator tone of the movie was fascinating and never wanted it to end ahh the batmobile gave me heart attack even engine voice just perfection and of course soundtracks what masterwork for this masterpiece movie thanks to michael giacchino hope we can get batman trilogy as soon as possible and really want to see bruce and selina relationship more1.0\tfelt as though they over used cat woman and under used the riddler there were few blatantly long dragged out scenes car chase is prime example all of the casting beyond falcone not menacing mob enough for me was fantastic the tone grit was fantastic the soundtrack was fantastic can wait for the sequel especially with the riddlers new friend to joining the cause0.0\tsuppose acting isn requirement in action movies anymore my goodness saw robin pattinson in the lighthouse and what performance that was in the batman is there any other batman he portrays pseudo meme of spoiled forgotten punker with didnt have any sleep for few nights look plastered upon his face it seems portraying batman requires only an octave lowered voice and less than squinty angry look the obvious dark make up doesnt help here many times when batman tried to be serious or dangerous just laughed the story or convoluted lack thereof was well as rising as christmas yule log without the bicarbonate it flopped paul dano was actually believable in the first opening minutes but fizzled out with his bad boy laugh and shrieks which were wholly misplaced no suspense no real antagonist cheap explosions and worst of all no gadgets whats next batman uses grappling hook and has to manually climb onto building what waste of resources my popcorn was more dangerous than batman breath1.0\tit pure noir detective story of batman this film will not be for everyone as it is complex dark and long however for batman fans this film might come close or even top the dark knight well done matt reeves1.0\tmastetpirece movie best batman film ever am excited to watch this movie robert pattinsin did very well mastetpirece movie best batman film ever am excited to watch this movie robert pattinsin did very well1.0\tif you have watched movies like prisoners no country for old man most of hollywood thrillers it belongs to same arena no where close to nolan batman series highly overrated nothing fresh it typical well written nd well directed film when nolan took over batman franchise he reinvented the batman nothing that sort from matt1.0\tuntil now we had the holy nolan trilogy hope and wish the years to come we will have the holy reeves trilogy enough said people who hasn seen the long halloweens animated movies or read the comics year one hush and the long halloween maybe won get the tune of the batman for the rest us we will love it ps never had doubt for pattinson as batman1.0\tfear is tool when that light hits the sky it not just call it warning the batman is the newest dc installment and take on the classic superhero when the riddler sadistic serial killer begins murdering key political figures in gotham batman is forced to investigate the city hidden corruption and question his family involvement think at this point we have 50 batman movies if we include the animated ones and everything involving him many have questioned why we need to start another franchise after the brilliant nolan films especially since the dark knight is considered one of the greatest films of all time since the trailer came out for this one something looked special about it it looked similar to something like joker and had the right elements going for it this film was quite the surprise it set the president for the best movie of the year and it ll be hard to beat what it accomplishes is more than anyone could ve imagined and at times makes nolan trilogy look smaller than this matt reeves directs this amazingly ve been fan of his since cloverfield there nothing of his that isn good and with his work on dawn of the planet of the apes it would be hard to see him doing something less than good he revives the story of batman creating sinister atmosphere there inspiration taken from zodiac and se7en basically anything fincher you can see that all in the tone visuals and execution grieg fraser is gonna be big name with this and dune his cinematography track record is more than great the four central characters along with their performances robert pattinson creates new batman that darker than we ve seen what interesting is his lack of dialogue most of what he does is silent which is good power dynamic zoë kravitz does the best catwoman yet with the most character development just loved her paul dano as the riddler is hypnotizing and incredibly interesting we hardly see him but when we do he gives it his all finally is colin farrell as the penguin what transformation you can tell it him from appearance to the voice don know how he got there but it an achievement to be that unrecognizable all of the characters are compelling not one is disposable the story is meticulous with every aspect think what makes the film so unique is the story it covers so many topics and dares to give social commentary police reform is big message and it really hits the nail with its portrayal this isn another superhero movie it spreading message at times it does feel weighed down by its three hour runtime honestly good 15 minutes could ve been cut the ending has trouble wrapping up but it all worth it if you didn have good time by the end something went wrong mean michael giacchino score is loud intimidating and the best batman theme we have yet and if you don like it you are alone there are so many aspects to like and by the end you see beautiful and haunting film ve seen it twice now both within couple days of each other go see the batman in the biggest loudest theater you can highly recommend dolby cinema can believe the reboot of reboot of reboot and so and and so forth is one of the best0.0\tnot really superhero movie more of crime drama not even crime thriller because there are no thrills but with no crime there so little storyline that it filled with looong scenes of exposition instead telling us what happened off screen years before so there no mystery to be solved or race against time to save anyone which leaves no reason to watch pattinson as batman played it very restrained to the point of boring the riddler was so lame that he was no threat to anyone his scenes were pretty embarrassing to watch like child pretending to be bad but think that because of his lame script catwoman was completely redundant and could have been easily cut from the movie with no consequence andy circus as alfred was truly awful there was no chemistry at all between him and batman it felt like all their scenes together must ve been cut as everyone else notes the film is also too long because we re not waiting for answers due to there being no crimes to solve very odd film needs complete re edit and decent plot adding1.0\tthis is the first movie of batman that reveals the human limitations of being hero the story is so efficiently paced making three hours feel like far far less1.0\tmovie for the true batman fans loved it every performance was great personally catwoman and the riddler stole the show for me the way they portrayed gotham on screen was just wow1.0\tthere is lot to love here all of the performances are top notch and pattinson holds the screen fantastically well as batman the direction and action is great and it really leans into the idea that he is detective using his wits as well as his fists catwoman is solid partner for him and the villains are gloriously nasty but it not perfect it at least half an hour too long and it is very monotone it takes itself very seriously and rarely raises smile at nearly three hours of super seriousness the men in masks risk nudging into ridiculousness it just about manages to stay on the right side of the line but if you re not into comic book movies it may be step too far for you1.0\tnot fan of the various caped crusaders men in tights and all that they all kinda seem juvenile to me the batman really won me over loved pattinson portrayal of the complex and traumatized batman bruce wayne plus he was not hard on the eyes at all same goes for zoe kravitz amazing as cat woman and pleasure to behold colin pharrell ok never would have guessed it was him in million years make up deserves an oscar all in all great entertainment1.0\tsaw it in theaters today expecting to hate it absolutely loved it very surprised plot had lot of depth acting performances were phenomenal the mood was incredible love that the director put his vision on screen and didn dumb down the film like many others have will say this was even better than nolan movies nolan tried to make the films like he had problem with batman in general batman begins was very good the dark knight wasn on repeat viewings and the dark knight rises was total failure altogether in this movie the director isn ashamed of the batman universe he didn dumb it down like zack snyder did this is batman this is gotham city in all its dirty glory my main issue is that the general audience might not appreciate it it three hours long action isn the greatest and can see how the plot would lose many in the audience it wouldn surprise me to see the next movie get dumbed down or to see another reboot it definitely is movie that gets you to forget every predecessor that was ever made very commendable highly recommended0.0\tdidn have high expectations since don know that anyone can top nolan dark knight the movie itself was subpar and rather boring but that seems to be common trend amongst the super hero genre as of late my biggest problem was with the overall wokeness of the film mean every bad person in the movie was white except batman every person who was good or replaced white character in the movie was poc know that we are in new age but is that all movies are capable of these days to spread the narrative of white man bad1.0\tyall really underrating this masterpiece its so good ll definitely wait for it to release in blu ray ill watch that movie more than times it really got me hyped up the action the cinematography in it was so good the acting top tier go watch it in the cinemas its worth it 101.0\tit seemed very familiar dark moody serial killer hunt with two opposite characters looking for clues there was even scene were the detective is reading journal of the riddlers ramblings which was like the same scene in se7en didn know if it was on purpose but do know what the film was highly enjoyable and at nearly hours long never seemed to drag the characters lived up to expectations especially cat woman and the penguin it completely different take of the batman films and it works what like best about it is that it doesn sell out with the over the top action sequences and stupid jokes it gritty and it real and looking forward to seeing it again1.0\tout of all the batman movies ive seen this is definitely among the best of them it starts out bit slow but about 30 40 minutes in it started to really grab my attention and become very good it is very much mystery thriller so if you were expecting lighthearted marvel type movie then this isnt for you did not watch many trailer beyond the first one so didnt expect it to be this dark but also wasnt dissapointed that being said it could have been more brightly lit other than that some fantastic performances and camerawork the fight scenes are probably the best in any batman movie all in all if you are batman fan you will most likely love this movie0.0\tlong boring and depressing it was hours drama just film noir not an action dc superhero movie the first two hours are boring and the last hour is even more boring make yourself favour and don waste your time or your money to watch this crap0.0\tlame and boring batman movie with minimum action and suspense that rated by fake users kid with bad costume design who tries to show himself serious but he fails he can not even walk and fight normally like an adult guy he is lame confused and coward kid that tries to hide his fears why they should put child in batman costume and why they gave the job to such weak director the only great batman movie that remember is batman vs superman directed by zack snyder badass batman with strong action sequences and amazing visuals please watch batman vs superman again and compire both movies0.0\tpolitical agenda movie for batman fans this is pure shit it waste of your time but hey if you watch it you ll see the evil white man against the righteous minorities pushing ck agenda like there no tommorrow yeah we all get it black is good white is corrupt but for fuck sake can you at least make it less obvious1.0\tthe story was amazing just kept you in for hours and you couldn blink and eye because it was all crucial no screen time wasted pattinson and kravitz were amazing of course and wow what genius matt reeves is the riddler was such an intriguing villain loved every bit of it1.0\tthis may be one of the greatest superhero movies have seen in long while the whole movie definitely earned it three hour runtime and honestly would go as far as to say that this movie had the plot of whole damn series while still maintaining the interest of the viewers the music was fantastic fight choreography great cinematics and visual effects were absolutely stunning and all in all the movie had this dark brutal and catchy feeling over it that made the movie seriously entertaining while the relations between some characters moved unnaturally fast the dialogue felt quite good while still having this dark layer over it would especially like to point out robert pattinson and andy serkis performances robert pattinson proving that he one hell of an actor and has the skill of legend and then andy serkis owning every scene he was in1.0\tam not batman dc fan do not need validation from them don care even if majority of the disagree having said those this film is freaking brilliant the story is suspense inducing and enjoyably convoluted the atmosphere is gloomy and dark the cinematography is just perfect actors did great job the film is long but never laggy sounds and music despite being reused multiple times throughout the course of the film was excellent could keep on going about the greatness of this film but like to keep it short understand why this movie is getting some hate but if you are focused and attentive you would have great time am looking forward to re watch this masterpiece multiple times in the future1.0\tthis movie is epic what grandeur drama 100 out of 10 that what would give to this movie greatest movie of our generation is what would like to say1.0\tfirst of all if you re expecting all action and adventure change your expectations this film works on little explored aspect the batman detective with this the film approaches works like se7en and zodiac by david fincher heavy dense dark and realistic are adjectives that accurately describe the film director matt reeves uses gothic aesthetic and accompanied the score with serious notes in addition to epic and beautiful photography every moment batman appears is epic giving us that first time feeling every time the screenplay is of immense quality with an excellent dynamic between investigations and brawls and even with an emphasis on the detective side and being almost hours long the film is perfectly balanced containing violence mysteries action and drama the actors deliver more than excellent work highlighting here are robert pattinson zoë kravitz paul dano and colin farrell however the rest have an exceptional level of performance each character having their story and their importance in the plot in short for me this is the official version of batman in theaters he has everything he needs intelligent agile cunning cunning skilled angry violent and more be it the uniform the batmobile or even the gadgets the character is being portrayed in the best and true way1.0\tthis movie shows why batman is my favorite character he finally lives up to the name the worlds greatest detective the cast is absolutely amazing and they all portray the characters we grew to love over the years absolutely perfectly and not to mention all the potential this movie leaves for any future content within this universe for me this movie takes the crown for best comic book movie ever for both being true to the comics and being great standalone movie that anyone not familiar with the extensive batman universe can love if giving it the option to urge you to watch it1.0\twhile not perfect robert gives great performance as batman and this universe that has been set up feels the most faithful to the caped crusader yet excited to see what comes next for this version of batman0.0\tthe slowest batman in the history of the bat the pace is so incredibly slow if the actual batman were this slow he would probably manage to save no more than people year catwoman is the one injecting bit of excitement at few random places in the movie but that can save this disaster movie that drags on for much too long0.0\tnot sure who dc paid off to get an stars on here but this movie was terrible boringly slow unnecessarily too long it couldn end fast enough was fighting to stay awake its was more of 3hr crime drama tv series than comic movie little action little dialog long drawn out heart to heart talks just terrible1.0\twent to see this twice in the space of week and both times the hours flew by was sceptical about pattison casting but he nailed it probably the least comic book style batman movie to date but also probably the most accurate depiction based on the comics more detective than super hero the villains weren over the top riddler was awesome looking forward to the development of penguin the batcave feels like something that could exist and have been made by batman compared to the elaborate ones used in previous films that would have needed huge construction crews to make without asking questions music was used very well loved the entire movie0.0\tjoker must be in tears to watch the mockery of modern batman without an aim it was complete disappointment to watch the steep decline in the standards of batman series which has been my favorite for ever no one could match christopher nolan standards how did the movie score is beyond my understanding0.0\tthis movie is like an rated shock horror movie keep in mind the batman saga is for little children around 10 years old make it cool no one doesnt like that but keep the shock content for actual horror movies instead of scaring little kids like that not cool they re just getting carried away with all this trying to one up each other and no one is stopping to say maybe that not good idea that the satanic power of money and show business guess1.0\tit batman but the most perfectly and beautifully crafted version yet it puts the focus on the story and characters above all else but when the action hits it hits hard it dark gritty visual feast1.0\tlove the movie very much it is an extraordinary one love the music love the dark tone gotham finally looks like gotham from the animated series only the police zeppelins are missing and even this version of batman looks more like terry mcginnis from batman beyond the movies is absolutely flawless and everyone says this is fenomenal and hope someday they will introduce the sequence with the joker this movies deseves 10 stars without any kind of doubt bravo1.0\tbatman is visual and auditive experience so go and watch it on imax but this movie is slow very slow that said don mind slow and long movies hours but when watched that movie felt like it was endless and yet didn want it to end sometimes you have to endure the calm to appreciate the storm but the problem with batman is that the conclusions are not necessarily satisfying supposed to be mystery based film never felt any questioning or curiosity about the riddler we also see the beginnings of young batman who is not very powerful which liked because it makes sense given that he is just starting out and bruce wayne lacking in self confidence and questioning the world but the problem is also there after long and not necessarily interesting discussions and conclusions we come to the fight scenes which never go perfectly given that we see young batman it realistic but at what cost the 3rd act of the movie is not great and loses even more of its rhythm and interest batman is visually beautiful movie with good actors but huge problem of rhythm and clearly lacks dynamism or creativity concerning the detective part that we appreciate much less from the 3rd act there is second huge disappointment but you will see it for yourself my rating is 10 for now despite these countless flaws it nice movie og1.0\timagine batman as franchise like james bond each movie in the future will be independent from one to another no more trilogy or reboot in the coming future it seems to me this is chris nolan creative signature realistic actions and close to realistic events the batman opens up the opportunity to widen the scope of stories that begins with the joker to start anew the superhero genre as big bombastic stories to be explored and exploited robert pattinson will not be the only actor to wear the cape but one of many possibilities the trend is set and now begins an era of new superhero movies will become new trend1.0\tso first off all these star reviews claiming were all paid reviews we aren bought my tickets and went with group of friends opening night and all four of us voluntarily left the glowing reviews it deserves ve seen them all multiple times all the dc films all the mcu films the animated the tv shows and none of them compare to reeves masterpiece yes it is in fact cinematic achievement this isn your daddy batman this is dark depressed emotionally scarred stunted and gritty batman still finding his way in the world the cinematography the sound track the sound design the set design the make up the costumes and the acting are all oscar nod worthy and out of this world some have complained about the run time nearly hours ve never known any real movie lovers complain about run time unless it was too short so chances are these are fans wanting hour action flick and this just ain that folks what this is is the most accurate depiction of comic book character ever made the best part is despite the long run time there is not single wasted scene in this movie there not wasted line in this movie it like being batman for hours if you hold comic batman dear in your heart watch this movie you ll love it1.0\tam forever thankful for matt reeves for creating such great batman story the story the pacing the character development the writing the cinematography the soundtrack the editing the performances by the actors this movie is perfect in every way saw some criticisms about the third act but need to say it as good if not better than the rest of the movie the batman nails the atmosphere of gotham city and the morals codes of characters such as batman and catwoman the story feels grounded but not too grounded yet not too grounded nailing the fine line between comicbooky and realistic ve been waiting for the batman since 2016 and it been forever worth it this is the batman movie was waiting for it feels like noir detective movie with elements and genres like action drama and romance the relationships between the characters and the love hate situations with the villains feel very natural1.0\treally enjoyed the movie thought it was great new take on batman the pacing was good and didn feel like hour superhero origin story wouldn even consider it an origin story this is more noir crime drama movie there were some beautifully shot scenes and the score really made some of the scenes come to life kravitz pattinson and especially dano did phenomenal job dano was twisted riddler and thought he killed his performance will say that this is one of the darkest movies in the superhero genre that ve seen but it also made the movie feel more realistic than anything else excited to see what the future holds for this trilogy1.0\tso being batman fan pretty much my entire life have always loved the dark knight with my favorite actor to play batman and my favorite actor all together christian bale but we need to look at the facts here the batman is easily the greatest batman movie ever made out of every single batman movie this was the most comic book accurate and the performance was on point robert pattinson was hands down the worlds greatest detective know there will be people to disagree with me but this is just how see it0.0\tthis movie is appalling cant believe spent 3hrs of my life watching this am completely batffled what they intended to do here the movie has no substance credence meaning direction it seems to think that nirvana song can carry the melencoly mood of the film noir potion that they seem to think would work here bruce wayne does not exist here as they painfully avoid giving the batman an alter ego the riddler is subterranean and pathetic in his cheap meaningless costume were he mite just swell be an annoying individual catwoman is catburglar cat lover go figure its pathetic joke and waste of beauty am disgusted at this instalment and have never seen such waste of huge potential ever could not care penny for the rating as its clearly flooded with mindless idiots who are misunderstood the most shocking super movie have ever seen1.0\tcouldn fully put my finger on it when first saw the movie but after the second viewing had better understanding of why this movie didn quite hit home for me to keep it short the big problems include the film trying to juggle too many villains at once making the movie so dark and gritty to the point where it doesn serve the character or story and the bloated run time that should ve been cut little to make the movie feel more focused and faster paced still give it or because love the batman character so much and this is only the first movie in what seems like trilogy also lot of aspects like casting and visuals ultimately saved the movie1.0\tit played more like crime mystery movie and kept you engaged the whole time you can compare it to anything that come before it breath of fresh air for batman1.0\tfor me this is the pinnacle of what batman film can be phenomenal performances paired with outstanding cinematography and brilliant writing detective noir thriller with the perfect amount of batman action1.0\tfrom the grungy soundtrack to the no nonsense action scenes this film exceeded all my expectations having been major fan of the nolan franchise also this is very different think seven meets the crow1.0\tthis movie is not just superhero movie it is neo noir crime drama it is most realistic superhero movies have ever scene not filled with vfx and is beautiful piece of art its not necessarily that everyone will like it this movie is not for all superhero fans not all superheroes swing or fly few superhero fans might not like this movie but in other hand many non superhero lover casual audience will like this movie batman is superhero which is closest to real life coz he doesn have super power but he has detective mind and he is trained fighter this movie is also very comicbook accurate casting is very good and actors have done their job very well specially selena kyle actress and battinson bgm is great however will not compare this to the dark knight that is still on top but am glad dc made this movie dc actually stands for detective comics and batman was detective originally so this type detective batman movie was much needed1.0\tthis movie was absolute masterpiece great cinematography great background music great actors great direction must watch movie for comic book superheroes fans1.0\tdon wanna sound fake here but do one favour pls watch this one just for my title of this review you guys are not gonna disappointed everything is almost 10 10 in this gem cinematography 10 10 screenplay 10 story 10 direction 10 acting 10 overall rating for me 10 for me masterpiece can wait for the part1.0\twhile batman is not exactly my thing do think it is really well done take on it think the major selling point of the movie is its cinematography they really did an incredible job with that some moments found really exciting some others were little bit slow and confusing all in all depending on how much you like batman would definitely recommend it1.0\tthe movie was very good was entertained the whole movie don listen to anybody that tells you that these are better than the nolan batman cuz they re not they are completely different style and type of movie so based on the style they went with they did very good job the nolan movies just felt bigger they got way more into bruce wayne gotham politics wayne enterprises and the character development was much better this movie you are thrown into the story and it is much more focused on batman vs riddler not much outside of that and it got pc which really hate sounds like was ripping on it the whole time but it really was cool and fun just think some people are getting little ahead of themselves if it were not batman movie give it an but since know what batman is and can be about it1.0\tthis is all that batman movie is supposed to be pattinson is the batman the greatest batman movie ever made movie that must be watched countless times0.0\tdon get the high praise this batman movie hates batman so let turn batman into guy who can only help old ladies cross the street all the white people are evil all the black people are good and batman realizes that fighting crime is bad half way through it looks nice but has little to no substance1.0\tthis movie pretty much just blew me away haven walked out of theater that excited in while it reaches toward perfection in my mind which equates to mad max fury road or pulp fiction to name few there seemed to be some outside the plot filler with an agenda if that wasn put in would call it perfect also the final crime was kind of eh but there was excellent acting great blend of action crime and maybe even horror and the sound and score wow it looked great they did fantastic job making this batman physically imposing and somewhat menacing figure think it my new favorite batman christopher nolan you had good run way to go matt reeves and crew1.0\tvery deep detective version of the batman films love how they turn vigilante superhero into detective role working out how to riddle the riddlers clues with his twist and conniving turns into tracking him down catwoman outfit was only slightly thing they got wrong like she had cut up neck warmer up to use as hodded disguise1.0\tthis movie features batman and catwoman teaming up to defeat the riddler that really all want to say about the plot and given that it hours long and easily the longest batman movie that quite an accomplishment for me seriously think robert pattinson might be my favorite batman the best part is probably how we was able to make great comeback from the twilight movies which pattinson himself hated even at this length it isn an origin story yes it really is probably too long but still fantastic movie the dark atmosphere is the grimmest gotham has ever looked they make it work because this is faithful to the comics and yet still an original idea for batman we get some interesting morals about vengeance and while there are great action scenes it certainly focuses more on mystery and character study yes am glad pattinson didn use voice like christian bale who knows maybe we have all the great batman actors meet up in crossover like spider man no way home the dark knight is still the best batman movie but this one certainly fourth maybe0.0\tthe opening was cool and the performances were good from the supporting cast but it did not stop the movie from falling apart for me did not care for pattinson bruce wayne the movie did not need to be nearly as long as it was just to explain criminal underground corrupt politician plot began to notice the same five locations popping up one after another due to its length making me think is there nowhere else to go in gotham weak third act which achieved nothing was not fan personally0.0\tas batman movies go this ranks somewhere between kilmer and clooney basically if the nipple batsuit was movie this would be it movie takes far too long to to develop the poly and when it does it falls as short as dwarf golf video slow and uninteresting is an understatement1.0\tjust when we thought no one in the film industry could understand the dark knight better than christopher nolan or zack snyder matt reeves knocks us out with smash hit called the batman finally dc best detective appears on the big screen exercising his worth pushed to the limit by the riddler but not before dishing out good dose of brutal revenge along the way it is the path of vigilante who becomes hero it is film full of details as exquisite as subtle light effects and puzzles under dark crude rotten and corrupt environment outstanding photography impeccable performances production design full of nods to its predecessor sagas and script that keeps you on the edge of the precipice calms you down and then pushes you into the abyss like leonidas in 300 so far the best ve seen this year1.0\tbeing huge fan of the christopher nolan trilogy starring christian bale could hardly imagine that the batman could come even close not being fan of robert pattinson at all doesn really help this but wanted to still watch it with an open mind liked however the ben affleck batman too quite lot and feel bit sorry that he didn get more screen time as batman so went to see the batman with quite low expectations at first this instalment is way darker then any previous instalment of the batman franchise and also it is the longest with almost reaching the three hours mark colin farrells transformation is as amazing as his performance as the penguin though he could have had more screen time paul dano as the the riddler is still terrifying and very disturbing villain he fitted the cast brilliantly zoe kravits performances as catwoman was amazing though she is not as cool as anne hathaways catwoman but her gesture and look is as wild as michelle pfeiffers and the catwoman fighting sequence is definitely win for zoe finally we got robert pattinson as the batman bruce wayne well for me the on screen chemistry of pattinson and kravitz did not match the chemistry and presence of christian bale and anne hathaway but still robert pattinson surprised me he played his role very well and maybe people will start thinking of him as the batman and not as the horrible looking guy in twilight the movie was not as action packed as the christopher nolan ones the batmobile is 60 muscle car look like with no real cool features as the tumbler also when it comes to gadgets that batman is using there is way less in here batman in the batman is more detective with partial anger management issues than the cool guy but then again this is very dark version in the end the batman is still hell of good movie it is still amazing and it still incredible and it is still batman was impressed by the most of the thing that happened was excited was hyped was stunt by all the amazing thing that they have done still the movie feels long but don know where would have cut it shorter1.0\tit very intresting to watch can wait to see the next movies of this universe acting was very good especially paul dano riddler plot and story was good too one thing don really like is pacing but it peak movie top cbm movie of all time1.0\trob batman was amazing haters will hate but this was about being detective batman what he really does not just fighting at night and villains helping the police watch the anime for all you guys hating on it gave me bit of dd vibes too will be watching again we need more of his batman1.0\tthe batman delivers without an origin story through excellent screenwriting it throws you right in director matt reeves understands to be apart from the dark knight 2008 the editorial works the result is an exhilarating movie the ambience vibrates with reference of cinema itself fulminate acting performances create view of gotham never seen before it dark it wet it flashy spectators breath gets taking by an instant batman highlight with the gotham square garden showdown the batman is less self reflecting than its predecessors which makes it an hero movie to be must watched1.0\tthis is easily the best batman movie since the dark knight if being honest still prefer afflecks batman but that not to say pattinson wasn good he was great they ve set up universe extremely reminiscent of the detective batman universe which we all wanted for so many years hatsoff to greig fraser matt reeves and michael giacchino colin farrell zoe kravitz jeffrey wright and paul dano steals the show but it would have been better if they set voice tone for paul dano when he not riddler every frame of this film is worth watching the efforts of the creators is clearly visible in the screen even if you hate the idea of pattinson as batman you should watch this movie this will go down as an example just as the dark knight oscars is coming for sureeee sorry pattinson sorry bale ben affleck is still my favorite batman the photo describes the mood when you are out of the house after decade batfleckforever thebatman1.0\tthe batman feels like the perfect antidote to the plethora of superhero movies that have been released in the last ten years because this isn typical superhero movie it serial killer and detective movie that has batman in it we have batman who is relatively new to the job who doesn have unrealistic vehicles or weaponry who is looking for the truth we ultimately have very grounded batman movie unlike anything we ve had in the past and it is awesome the movie tells the story of youngish batman who patrols the shadows of gotham city who is trying to bring order to the city through fear but ultimately feels like he is failing as crime rates are spiralling out of control we follow batman investigation in association with jim gordon into new serial killer and as the body count rises batman is given more and more clues to attempt to solve the overall riddle of the story this movie is not going to be for everyone it dark in more ways than one firstly it is visually dark in almost every single scene for many it will be too dark it mainly set at night so we get the dark poorly lit streets of gotham which look amazing however we also get darkness in the majority of internal scenes characters seem to be unaware of light switches that being said it is clearly theme to present darkness and light with the light representing hope and therefore we mainly see darkness secondly this movie does not have jokes or much humour one typically associates with superhero movies which is refreshing change of tone to the wildly popular genre the movie is almost nearly hours long whilst the first half had somewhat steady pace the second half literally flew by at supersonic speed making the movie feel more like presentation what makes this movie is the atmosphere the sound and the visual it incredible and captivating combination of perfectly selected songs and brooding original score really emphasises the darkness the fear the suspense and the size of the situation the cinematography is gorgeous it is so well done mixing variety of different techniques angles and perspectives which give difference emphasis and draw light which is needed to the focal point honestly it is difficult to take your eyes off this once it begins what also cool about the movie is that we get slightly different retelling of the batman story and the implied backstory as mentioned this is youngish bruce wayne who has only been out on the streets as the batman for two years whilst he exceptionally intelligent and fearsome in combat he is still learning about himself and what needs to be done we also get bruce wayne that doesn embrace the playboy public persona we ve grown the know he isolated and dishevelled it different but works to conclude this is the first movie in quite some time where ve wanted to revisit the theatre again to watch on the big screen before it gone1.0\tthis movie didn disappoint go watch it rn but dont expect it to be light fun action superhero movie cuz the story is dark so oh and the cast was perfect the story the plot suspense were amazing the soundtrack matches the movie so much got chills and the cinematography was 100 10 it was that good and the colour grading effects were perfect too overall 10 101.0\tconsidering the batman movies that came before this one mean wow hats off to the team involved in pulling off masterpiece such as this the cast writing cinematography and music all merging perfectly here the movie has slight goth feel to it for which pattison is perfect fit the world it set in feels physically real and the attention to detail is excellent to the degree of the smudge eye makeup batman has1.0\twow mann such an amazing masterpiece have ever seen thanks all for who worked for this film cinema work wish one day would get chance to play son of the batman1.0\tsuppose was in denial about my own excitement for the batman for long time as much as was disappointed in batman vs superman loved ben affleck incarnation of the character and was so desperate to see him get his own solo film so when it became clear that we would never see that film any updates about this version were always somewhat tinged with sadness for me despite my love for matt reeves as filmmaker think all my doubts started to pass once the absolutely fantastic marketing campaign started and got sense of the vision reeves was bringing to this character and have to say it was everything wanted it to be while ll always wonder what the ben affleck film would ve been like absolutely love what matt reeves did with this character and world loved how overwhelmingly dark and repressed bruce wayne is in this film it felt in keeping with the lore of the character while still feeling like an approach we hadn seen before the arc the character ultimately got wasn the one was expecting and managed to tell key aspect of batman story without feeling the need to tell the origin story again my only real issue was the somewhat lack of the bruce wayne persona understand what reeves and pattinson are trying to do here and that aspect of the character isn absent entirely but just wanted little more out of it since it is such fundamental part of batman history thought robert pattinson was absolutely fantastic didn once feel like he was trying to mimic any of the other actors who ve played the part before and loved the sense of trauma he brought to his performance with just the right amount of vulnerability truly cannot wait to see where this iteration goes next also thought all the antagonistic and supporting characters brought lot to this film and liked each and everyone of the performances ve liked paul dano for quite few years now ve been waiting for him to get proper mainstream role like this and he didn disappoint thought he brought just the right amount of menace to the riddler and within just enough eccentricity without it feeling like parody or poor mans joker despite not always being presence on screen or threat physically always thought he managed to remain intimidating and the few times he shares the screen with pattinson are extremely well done do think some of the actions taken by the character are bit beyond believability but not to the point where it took me out of any scenes lot has been made of colin farrell transformation as the penguin but the reason for that is because it works so well for this version he considerably more grounded in this movie but farrell and reeves aren afraid to lean into the more over the top aspects of the character he was by far the most straight up entertaining part of the film and thought his character was used sparingly enough to leave me wanting more also really liked zoe kravitz as selina kyle she had really good dynamic with batman and liked that they didn make her fully antagonistic but considerably more layered jeffrey wright was fantastic as gordon he has an immediate chemistry with pattinson and his performance helped ground some of the more comic book like scenes in some sense of reality john turturro was great in this movie as falcone liked that he didn give of an immediate sense of intimidation but instead was much more laid back and passive the way he tied into the story is extremely effective from character perspective and creates for lot of great moments of tension and conflict one of the only aspect of the film that felt undercooked was andy serkis as alfred serkis is great as much sterner type of incarnation and he has good back and forth with pattinson but his scenes are just too few and far between and didn really feel any sort of wrap up with his character by the time the film ended from an aesthetic point of view this may be the best batman film we ve ever had grieg fraser cinematography is completely stunning it moody dark with just the right amount of added colour and gives of never ending sense of dread and despair while also just being gorgeous to look at matt reeves continues to be one of the most interesting blockbuster directors working today loved all of his choices behind the camera in this movie he lets all the actions sequences breath without quick cutting them to death and loved the slow methodical pace he kept the movie at he manages to keep things gripping thrilling and mysterious for the entire runtime without it ever feeling boring think this may also be the best portrayal of gotham city put to screen so far as much as love the nolan trilogy gotham in those films began to feel like any other city as things went on but here it feels entirely distinctive it never once feels like city within our world but instead the crime ridden and corrupt hell hole that it always been depicted as loved how stylised the technician presentation of this film was as whole love to see studios allow directors more freedom in creating their own styles in franchises because haven seen blockbuster that looks quite like this before and love to see more of them the batman was absolutely one of those movies that completely lived up to its expectations the portrayal of batman is fascinating and not one that been done quite like this before even if wanted more out of the bruce wayne aspect thought the film did good job of balancing all of its main villains and supporting character giving them more than enough to do in the process the overall look and aesthetic is stunning with such great portrayal of it central location think reeves did something truly special here and can wait to see what more he does with this character going forward 10 phenomenal0.0\tbig disappointment the movie is boring and lacks excitement would consider it as the worst batman movie was really hoping for something good after watching the 2nd trailer anyways the movie is really bad and have wasted hours of my time1.0\tthe title says 90 of what have to say here pattison has elevated himself to one of the top actors in the game today jeffrey wright is magnificent even andy serkis is surprising show stealer this flick would have gotten ten stars from me but visually was very put off by the lack of light lack is an understatement it like the director forgot to call lights before camera and action you can barely see what going on in some scenes when watching it in theater maybe it was done as style but what good that if no one can see what you re doing seven of ten stars1.0\tjust as you expect from matt reeves he just filmed everything wanted from batman movie this movie is masterpiece and people should acknowledge that because this movie is everything fan could hope from batman imo this is the best robert pattinson acting after the lighthouse plot was great it didn even feel like hour movie sooner or later people will compare this to the dark knight1.0\tve seen this movie twice now and contemplating going third time everything in this movie perfectly encapsulates the tone batman movie should possess it truly is an art piece that ll keep the cogs in your head turning all the seemingly insignificant details play larger role in tying up the story for an equally shocking yet satisfying conclusion robbert pattinson set new standard for not only any future batman but for superheros as whole desperately craving more of him and this universe1.0\tthe batman is gripping gorgeous and at times genuinely scary psychological crime thriller that gives bruce wayne the grounded detective story he deserves writer director matt reeves and the actors pattinson collin farrell paul dano jeffrery wright and andy serkis managed to make batman movie that entirely different from the others in the live action canon yet surprisingly loyal to gotham lore as whole ultimately it one that thoroughly earns its place in this iconic character legacy loved this movie the directing thrilling plot action sequences and acting were all on point initially thought the hour runtime was too much for new movie especially considering the bad box office performances for dc movies and the dc and hbo max dilemma but was thoroughly entertained well worth the paying extra for early fan first experience watched it on 03 011.0\tapril 4th saw it on movie theater what dramatic and brilliant action and mysteries robert and zoé and jeffrey the funniest things is paul and colin were kind comedic villain and fights are kind rated style violence but it was great to see it and car chase is also kind intense and reminds me of many action thriller movies good job ll give you 10 stars for enjoying us and my mom didn know colin farrell was penguin can wait for sequel1.0\tthe batman first hour and half delivers great action story visuals and characters it is almost flawless however movie struggles and becomes melodramatic mess after focusing on side strories when it tries to be grounded with traumatic characters pattinson is probably the best batman but possibly the worst bruce wayne along with clooney bruce wayne supposed to be smart sociopath who disguises as playboy philantropist billionnaire in this movie bruce wayne walks around like suicidal addict who struggles with heavy depression paul dano as riddler and colin farell as penguin are fun and scary and pattinson as batman is perfect though in the end it is nowhere close to the dark knight because of melodramatic second half 100.0\tthis can be batman parody movie but if it not then it must be the worst batman movie ve ever seen compared to dark knight trilogy this is joke villians used to be very charismatic and have depth to them here they are joke all characters are shallow from batman to gordon to all the villians0.0\tconfused my the high ratings on here thought the batman was horrible think pattinson is terrible batman imo many many eye rolling scenes also not fan of woke movies0.0\twas underwhelmed by this iteration of the multiple versions of batman pattinson functioned more like sullen teenager in search of his identity than confident billionaire the plot ran like procedural crime investigation rather than an action packed thrill ride even penguin and riddler were toned down behind masks or gads of prosthetic make up admit danny devito penguin is etched permanently in my mind zoe kravitz plays serious catwoman devoid of catty pranks do have to say the fact batman never went away with her always made me sad forget gotham you big dumb lug perhaps the biggest fail was the complete and total lack of humor had to wait all the way to the end of three long hours to have paul dano finally make me laugh go see it and maybe you will enjoy it we all look for different things in batman1.0\twasn exepting much but damn wasn suprised beautifull chemistry between cat and bat not too soppy their relationship was just perfect and have to admit that roberts performance ass the batman was phenomenal music villain stunts and tension were keeping me entertainet for whole movie ll must say that this was the best batman ever1.0\tthe batman lays thick veil of darkness over the gotham city previously seen and loved with noir story that breaks the chain of monotonous superhero movies and delivers detective classic reeves delves into the psychology of the dark knight peeling back layers of lies and corruption in each and every intricate character introduced while the almost hour mark is intimidating to general cinema goers this time frame does the story justice and holds up over each act as viewers are immersed in the brooding world created and brought alive using real life locations and sets greig fraser inviting cinematography works to pull audiences right in complimented by pattinson narration which feels almost like piggy backing the caped crusader around gotham instilling strange subliminal empathy in viewers for the city unfortunate dwellers it safe to say that this is the best film adaptation of the batman giving an extensive psychologically rooted point of view of the familiar character in whole new light the exploration of the depth of trauma is present in both batman and his foe the riddler as noted by director matt reeves both identities were born of trauma the extent of bruce unresolved mental troubles is proven as even when unmasked he thinks of nothing but ongoing crime and dirt unable to hold an otherwise normal conversation with his peers being only two years into relentlessly fighting criminals night after night his mind filters triggers and has entirely let go of self care giving himself completely over to the night the riddler brings an element of horror that keeps audiences engaged and some ill at ease with his sudden violent moves the hair rising score by michael giacchino perfectly complements the classic horror elements in the film dano acting and heavy muffled breathing adding to the tone of his character without speaking word the only criticism regarding the riddler is the reveal while it grounded and realistic the build up is thrilling there no explosive unmasking moment besides the depiction of characters is an art that reeves has otherwise mastered introducing number of nameable characters but letting none take the show oswald kobblepot the not yet penguin played by the well hidden colin farrell plays into his nonchalant mafia esque charade dodging bullets when he not firing any his current employee at the iceberg lounge selina kyle played exquisitely by zoe kravitz brings fierce independence with an equal balance of emotion shown through her determination of tasks and survival above all carmine falcone brought to life by john turturro entertains the chilling power of the elite as he has the entire city in the palm of his hands as the film progresses long sought after detective story unravels itself jeffrey wright james gordon working magnificently with pattinson batman both characters rely on each other gordon in terms of trust as most of his fellow associates moonlight as cops and batman relying on insight to crime scenes and deeper corruption amongst many favourable scenes and parts the interrogation of the riddler feels like it been ripped out from comic book from the eerie build up to the reveal of the riddler plan and batman relentless fury to the atmosphere built in such small space the acting is truly defining on both parts leaving viewers feeling bundle of emotions in response to riddler reaction in one hand and anger on the other the batmobile chase scene is spectacular opening with tense fight and introduction scene for the batmobile abort not letting other characters steal the show because the batmobile did just that the chase is nerve wrecking as the camera cuts between batman and the penguin viewers get real sense of these characters under pressure in the end as seen in the trailer the bat catches up to oz and gives the coolest shot yet batman walking out from he flames unphased and full of determination to get what he came for overall brilliant film and few paragraphs cannot do the sheer volume of comic book greatness justice critiques wise they are very vague and small unworthy of mention this film delivers1.0\tfollowing the director filmography we can find several common points between this film and war of the planet of the apes in both he began with strong base of personality of the characters but molding them for the epic that narrated that little or nothing resembled the classic in this film he takes the realistic vision created by nolan in the cinema even further and takes the world greatest detective attributed to batman in the comics to the extreme it is thriller that drinks from modern classics like se7en or zodiac as well as from the 70 crime movies the narrative moves at very good pace driven by causality that makes you be tied to the seat without blinking the action is very dosed but very well paced especially they are very coherent at narrative level that could be real pattinson fits perfectly as batman even though his bruce wayne side is totally secondary both the soundtrack and the cinematography press you against your seat thanks to their contrast and the oppressive atmosphere they both create in perfect sync with the rest of the film1.0\tyes this movie has changed the concept because most superhero movie contains lots of cgi graphics spl effect and if you remove that there will be nothing left as they don have good story to present now coming to the important point if you love flying dragons and alien stuff kindly don watch this movie this movie is only for those people who actually understand the cinema it has awesome script story plot matt reeves has presented this batman so well that we can finally get over previous one robert pattinson has nailed this role his body language is same as what we read played in arkham games comics fighting sequence there has been rumour about pg15 but trust me this movie you can watch with your family as well as kids almost all fighting scenes are real and has been done by pattinson as well as stuntman which by the way looks amazing already excited for second part1.0\tthe caped crusader as an intense detective sans superpowers kudos to director matt reeves for avoiding the trappings of the all too familiar pow wow superhero formula and creating dark thriller that has action suspense acting chops well done pattinson neo noir elements and brooding music soundtrack to hold my attention for its almost hour run time the batman is indeed an addictive and mesmerising watch1.0\twatched the batman with robert pattinson tenet as bruce wayne batman jeffrey wright shaft casino royale as james gordon andy serkis star wars the last jedi as alfred pennyworth zoe kravitz mad max fury road as selina kyle catwoman john turturro brother where art thou as carmine falcone colin farrell the lobster as oswald cobblepot the penguin and paul dano looper okja as edward nashton the riddler pattinson did great as the caped crusader also kravitz was the best catwoman on screen ever also the riddler was creepily terrifying loved we got to see the detective side of batman also loved it was very much crime film or drama in its dna my only was the pacing think it ran bit long 10 minutes long breaking the recording of the previous longest batman film the dark knight rises score by michael giacchino spider man no way home cinematography by greig fraser rogue one dune part one and amazing direction by matt reeves war for the planet of the apes great to see the detective side of batman 101.0\tit was amazing the best batman film to date the action tops the action we saw in the nolan films tops the dark knight by lot which is very hard to do can wait so see what comes next with this universe0.0\treally wanted to like this its beautifully shot noir lightning and atmospheric way too long and plot messy qbd just throws all gotham characters in to the mix the problem is with barely any character development in nearly hours you just don care about any of them spent most of film picking out local locations liverpool deansgate printworks nightclub etc and asking if its over yet even my daughter managed to literalltly fall asleep for hours1.0\tnice cinematography the idea of batman as vulnerable character is original the performance of robert pattinson is more than ok don find the combination of pattinson and kravitz working very well don feel true connection between them sometimes had the feeling was watching two teenagers in some kind of romance the film is pretty realistic down to earth not to much special effects1.0\tall ve ever wanted from batman movie and more can wait to see where they go with the next one this film is definitely the best batman film to date with its detective noir elements1.0\tthe batman directed by matt reeves bring us crime noir driven retelling of the caped crusader bruce wayne robert pattinson entering year of his career as batman still trying to find his true purpose he has his determination pushed to the limit when serial killer called the riddler paul dano begins targeting the officials of gotham now batman must delve deeper into the criminal underworld and uncovering the dark secrets and lies the city hold it really goes without saying batman is character whose been around for long long time over all the decades there have been multiple interpretation of the character spotlighting the many attributes of him the batman is one of those installments capturing the true gritting despair and excitement of the franscise not seen since the burton films or mask of the phantasm it borrows many elements from films such se7en and adds it with specks of realism the the nolan trilogy perfecting without abandoning it comic roots the cast as whole does not disappoint robert pattinson captures the core of batman he brooding mysterious and doesn really speak much as some would probably expect most of the time he moves in such shadows pace that it adds to his presence around that even though you can see him you can feel him when the scene when people stare at him he feels otherworldly much like keaton batman as bruce wayne it by no means the worst bruce as it does reflect more so the coming of gotham knight bruce wayne in this is really more so social reclusive as stated in the trailers he doesn really do much financial for the city or make public appearances to the point most people don even recognize him it make sense at first that remembering this is still young batman still trying to find himself and become the dark knight his bruce wayne as it been pointed out his appearance is rather emo batman it does break the separation of worlds between batman and bruce wayne because he doesn really act like different person in public how he looks and acts it wouldn be surprising if people did suspect him as batman bruce is much so spiteful and fueled lot more by rage clearly shown in how he fights the fight scenes in this mare brutal and it great fortunately he in the batsuit for the majority of the film the overall tone is very film noir the fill of lies and deception it settings dark and gritty and depression it feel like batman it batman movie that finally showcases himself as detective gathering and deciphering clues interrogating suspects there was no better villain to sell that then the riddler who really more than robert this was the character that interested me the most the riddler has always had more comedic presence toward mainstreams seen as more of showman then real serious threat while jim carrey hold special place in many hearts mine included giving riddler more zodiac killer persona is more fitting to the character riddles puzzle cryptic deathtraps similar to joker he very vindictive and diabolical when it comes to proving his point much like health leather in the dark knight he has sort of an anarchist vibe but he has reason for why he doing all this and that really the glue of the film while he hams it up bit in some spots the only real issue with riddler is his outfit his costume looks terrible especially when you finally see his face give him green question mark suit and eye mask he would look just like riddler from the comics zoë kravitz as catwoman liked more than thought originally going to with other interpretations michelle pfeiffer always came off as the most natural catwoman she was playful sexy aggressive and left an iconic performance that none could match while not as iconic as pfeiffer she does bring something to the movie though it seems her character starts to fall apart after after the first hour she most definitely better than anne hathaway and halle berry unlike riddler her outfit is good except for that mask it so cheaply made and more silly that she almost shouldn wear it you don really know much about her outside of her connection to falcone but the dynamic between her and batman does work enough even though the chemistry between them isn really believable unlike black jim gordon jeffrey wright who when it comes to live action probably the best after gary oldman this is probably the most screen time gordons ever gotten in single batman movie he spends lot of time interacting and aiding batman with the riddler and he main character it great as both of them represent the to shades of justice that gotham needs outside of animation gordon is overlooked sometimes and here it feels like theirs is relationship between these two he stands with batman even though the whole police department doesn like batman while at the same time have this rather fed up attitude it nice addition also nice change of pace is seeing batman in the criminal underworld interacting with not just supervillains but mobsters like the penguin colin farrell who looks amazing with the make up he not as over the top as danny devito but he is having blast with this character he in the film just enough that he leaves impression and has purpose without distracting from the main plot the same for carmine falcone it adds to the world building of just how corrupt and horrible gotham really is the mob actually serves high purposes to the film the city itself has style to it meaning it actually feels like gotham city from it more gothic architecture like with wayne manor to the dark seediest of the slums it always rainy it the best looking gotham since the burton films it doesn look like new york overall the batman is enticing story with it grounded tone it gripping psychological thriller that balances the character of batman as whole with runtime that uses it to its fullest it fleshes out the story while not having to rehash material already seen it action is great and it balances it well with detective work creating an immersive crime drama1.0\tcinematic masterpiece from start to finish loved every minute action shots very well shot and choreographered robert pattinson plays very good and dark bruce wayne very good performance from him very good casting for all parts on par with the dark knight if not better very well directed by matt reeves1.0\tabsolutely riveting robert pattinson channels bruce wayne exceptionally people tend to forget batman is human not super human and has had dark trauma and pattinson really exemplifies this there were some quirks that were slightly disappointing for someone who grew up loving dc like the bat ave and bat mobile however aspects like these made batman seem lot more realistic and appreciate that overall great movie that is worth watching0.0\tcould have easily shaved off 45mins they did every scene way too slow to drag it out suppose to build characters more or to get you to connect but only need too for certain scenes to emphasise them and make more dramatic not every single scene1.0\tthis movie is about as good as it gets acting filming and soundtrack to the movie is all top notch going to explain something though to viewers who went into this unprepared this is not by any means blockbuster film it is meant to be totally immersive experience into the world of gotham it puts you in the seat of batman gotham pd criminals and everything in between in terms of staying to true to source this is about as close as you will ever get so don go into it expecting nolan film or explosions all over the place with constant action look at it as vr experience into the world as batman truly remarkable film1.0\tve added this movie to my watchlist back in 2016 when all we knew was that there standalone detective batman movie coming with matt reeves directing it then the quarantines and the postponed release dates came ve waited an additional week to see the film after its premiere and oh boy was it hard this movie was worth the wait haven been this excited about film for so so long those hours will fly by in the cinema need to go to the bathroom hold it in my guys felt like kid getting goosebumps through half the scenes trying to pay attention to every single detail and also not mention every piece of trivia to my friends while the movie was running first of all finally not joker centered batman movie love our crazy clown but he needed rest not many casual batman fans or movie goers knew about the riddler penguin or falcone so that was great to give everyone glimpse into the gotham underworld and other villains before the start thought there will be too much selina kyle but once again was surprised the movie does great job of keeping the main focus on batman and bit of bruce while also not leaving that strong supporting cast in the shadows the year batman is also amazing he young he still about vengeance he has many flaws he messes up gets injured but he still batman and that they ve kept the mask makeup on after he takes off his cowl is just chef kiss very early batmobile him still doing reconnaissance as civilian he going further down into gotham rotten core and discovers not everything is as one sided as it sometimes seems dc animated movies comics and arkham games do so well with batman loved everything about this to see the iceberg lounge was an experience in itself the building lighting and music were top notch so happy there will be penguin series with colin farrell and the batsuit it pleasure to just look at it the details boots cape detachable bat symbol batarang to see young bruce becoming one with the batman persona wanted to write something else but ve forgotten oh well hush are you interested in batman watch the movie go into the theater as hater if you want because know many people will do that but don lie to yourself after you come out because this is masterpiece1.0\tfilm that makes you not only fear batman but love him aswell feat never conquered by any film maker before great story beautiful cinematography heartfelt ending 10 101.0\tthis happened to my buddy eric once it was in gotham city not sure where that is however all do know is that he became somewhat of an emo like bruce wayne unsure about what exactly happened there though honestly think eric been through lot and wish him the best for his journey through this thing we call life1.0\tthink may have new favourite bat film hits in all the right places the castings are a1 aside maybe falcone alfred but that by no means says they were bad pattinson nails the bat bruce combo 3hrs and loved every minute of it the aesthetic was absolutely on point and gotham was gotham as it should be want more0.0\ttried so hard to like this movie tried my best but will never be rewatching this abomination if you like this movie glad you like waisting hours of your life wanted to get up and leave the theatre more times then wish wanted about fell asleep twice waited so long for this movie to come out expected to love it as much as spider man no way home and expected to walk out the theatre in utter shock and thought wouldn be able to shut my mouth for days on how good it is but the utter shock walked out of there feeling was just sad the story is so confusing at points all conversations are so slow and long and boring and don help move the story the action scenes were so cool looking but with the dissatisfaction was already feeling couldn enjoy the action especially when there hardly was any at all will never be rewatching this what makes this worse is that it hours long if was able to make this movie myself would have made it hour and half or hours at most but making people sit and half hours that including starting commercials is just too much people are comparing this movie to be as good as the dark night and if your one of those brain dead people would love to hear what made you love this film because don see how anyone could like this movie buff and always give every movie chance or at least have one good thing can say about it but have never wanted to leave movie more and rather watch playing with fire for hours instead of this abomination of movie sorry to the other people who had to sit through the movie like me feel awful that you had to experience the same misery as me and to anyone who wants to see the movie please wait till it makes its way to homes so you can at least pause the movie to take breaks or whatever because watching all hours at once about killed me walked out of that theatre in the pissiest mood ever can wait for dc to make another joyless reboot of another superhero movie from this point forward will look at every review can find before see another dc film and if just so badly am desperate to watch it ll wait for redbox disappointed dc you have lost lot of respect from me1.0\tsaw the movie twice in row the movie is intended for smart people not for posers that never saw comic or know the story of batman saw tons of bad reviews but thought they ignorant ones1.0\tit was really good movie my advice is not to compare it to previous batman or bruce waynes because this batman is much more depressed and different watch and enjoy like you ve never watched batman movie in your life1.0\tnot fan of dc last movies not fan of pattison not fan of batman not fan of cat woman not fan or re boots but this one was wow wow wow slow paced deep dark cruel but amazingly cool made some moments were soooo good wanted to re watch them after leaving cinema well done dc this time really1.0\t10 it the most grounded often brutal detective film noir of the batman series and loved this movie it not my favorite batman movie but given the seriously stellar cast the low tech aspects they mixed in with the usual high tech equipment we see in batman movies these days it in my top really enjoyed the low tech approaches they implemented such as the batcar the batbike thought that made the film different from the others which they needed to do please zack snyder stop making christopher nolan super hero films robert pattinson is honestly one of the best leading men of our time and love how low key he is and the fact he started it all with twilight which have seen all of them while getting high off of night time alka seltzer in an attempt to get over cold had makes his career that more impressive robert pattinson can effectively erase twilight from his resume now he does so many good movies in the past five years lot of low budget art house movies that got almost no play but you can find them on netflix and hulu they are truly amazing cat woman was good not great the villain was super intelligent but don know maybe too weirdo than it needed to be and did you know collin ferrell was in this you won recognize him swear to god thought bobby de niro was in this playing the penguin1.0\thonestly not surprised at how good of job pattinson did with the batman role all the haters only remember his twilight stint and probably haven seen any of his lesser known movies which he is fantastic in also the cinematography in this film is just awesome the score the mood the acting was everything ever wanted out of batman movie most comic accurate depiction ve seen in awhile1.0\tthe batman good and gritty with the noir flavour that joker possessed plus touch of blade runner in the way the big screens on buildings in gotham square contrasted with derelict decaying properties elsewhere in the city even the film digital stock has friable feel look to it robert pattinson makes good tormented conflicted caped crusader but his acting style doesn differ between the roles of wayne and batman colin farrel is the penguin not super villain just nasty gang leader intent on rising to the top tier makes him all the more believable maybe better joker than devito zoe kravitz as catwoman is no villain but she is prepared to deal with the devil to exist noirish femme fatale for batman but also an avenging angel in her own right the riddler paul dano is indeed an enigma as he kills those who lie truth it very nature and the many lies which underlie perceptions of reality are crucial to the development of the film narrative and an understanding of his character the brutal nature of the murders he commits are spawned from the founding myths that gotham city and it leading families are based on perhaps tad too long while it didn really drag some of the scenes could have been edited might have been better film at 150 rather than 176 minutes directed co_written by matt reeves 101.0\tlove love love batman is just so badass robby was way better than expected not nolan but this absolutely delivers hope to god there is sequel1.0\tfootsteps how can you make another batman film when there are so many unique takes on the character the answer is simple you follow in the footsteps of your predecessors and put your own spin on it that is exactly what matt reeves has done with this film matt reeves has made definitive batman film that oozes inspiration in every shot the music is the perfect callback to batman the animated series while remaining unique in its own right greg frasier cinematography is flawless you could take every frame in this film and hang it on the wall as artwork the actors are casted perfectly and they each play an important role riddler plan impacts every character in pivotal way while exposing the truth of gotham gotham is unique city that feels dirty terrifying and corrupt it feels like city that belongs in our world world of corruption and waste the message of this film is important for the times we live in batman realizes that he cannot stop crime by just beating random thugs alone and relying on fear he must become beacon of hope for the city for two hour and fifty five minute film the pacing is amazing and there are plenty of moments that let the film breathe even with the long length it will leave you wanting more this film has laid the groundwork for what could be an incredible journey for the caped crusader despite the teases of sequels this film stands greatly on its own and will be talked about for long time to come1.0\thave to say this is the best batman movie made in terms of visuals to date it incredibly good to look at stunning and the soundtrack compliments it very well the storyline is very well written this is more of detective batman where considerable amount of the movie is spent on detective work this is not nolan epic the story is smaller in scale and focuses on crime scenes and solving riddles there are some missed opportunities for example while the action is short and sweet think there was lot of opportunity to include more raw violent fight scenes along with better use of batman gadgets there is also missed opportunity with the soundtrack while the main theme is awesome and powerful the music that used in between falls flat and is very generic also some dialogue is very boring and felt like filler the entire romance between bat and cat was forced have no idea why they keep attempting it they should just drop the whole romance factor and focus more on actual plot or add some more action truly loved the bat mobile and the car chase scene was great and realistic esp adding on traffic in the chase scene made it more realistic1.0\tthe batman movie is well filmed and made fun action movie but the movie could have been much sorter since 3h for movie is bit tooo long but otherwise the movie was good0.0\tso just saw the bat cat man boy movie last night and it was hilarious waste of three hours of my life right off the bat cat we aren given reason to care about anything or anyone no characters were developed no relationships established not single meaningful conversation was had between these people who are facing life threatening criminal everyone motivations were either stupid or uncommunicated it pains me to say catwoman was pointless but it okay because literally every one was you could ve made noir movie without the bat if you wanted to do so very badly the coloring was weird there were so many missed opportunities for interesting shots the soundtrack was ugly can believe they dragged kurt cobain into this the movie took itself too seriously to the point where it felt like parody of itself can go into details but just tired at this point it was god awful joke paul dano did his best with what he had and his acting was the only thing that was acceptable in this movie all the characters were non characters the plot was dumb and it it didn need batman to happen idk how to explain this without spoiling robert pattinson was not given much to work with but god was he snooze the waste of colin farell is criminal if you ll hire an actor and put him in fat suit to make him unrecognizable just hire fat actor what the point the penguin was pointless the knock off god father guys were pointless the cat subplot was stupid and it did nothing for the main plot every time she almost does something that has any semblance of impact she is stopped to the point where you could remove her entirely from the movie and nothing will change cat and bat chemistry is forced to the point where seeing them kiss made me genuinely uncomfortable this movie was not written idk how to explain this but it felt like they had vague idea of what they were going for and then just started filming theres no dialogue the pacing is strange it is extremely slow and then it becomes abrupt idk how relatable the following experience is but it felt much like landing on camelback the communication of information in three hour long movie is too direct as if they didn have time to shove in all the nothing they wanted to say it was heartless soulless and uncreative it felt like none of the people making it actually cared at all1.0\tenglish actor robert pattinson is no stranger to chaos and in the 2022 release the batman the whole of gotham is in chaos if you ve seen pattinson perform in cosmopolis by director david cronenberg it will give you taste of what to expect in this incredibly dark even for dc take on comic book character that been part of pop culture since world war batman movies since 1989 have always taken walk on the dark side but this is whole new level of film noir indie dark pattinson has also seen his share of post apocalyptic roles with the rover by director david michod shot in australia and feel the sequel to this is headed in that direction no spoilers there after all robert has signed on for three picture franchise deal in the rubber rat suit with wings and cape the batman director matt reeves actually wrote this movie for pattinson even before he agreed to sign on the dotted line imagine if you will this awkward moment when robert was working on tenet with dark knight director christopher nolan and attending auditions for the batman on his days off and here does he get those toys the batman is the first time we see the muscle car inspired batmobile of 2022 as it appears like stephen kings christine through the misty rain roaring like hell on wheels it is straight out of the demonic bowels of hell itself and ready to rock roll and take no prisoners but what interesting about this take on batman is they waste no time in setup of his new gadgets they just appear so accept it no room for style intros here pattinson is joined in all star cast with the tiniest cat woman ever in zoe kravitz plus felix leiter jeffrey wright from bond is back from the dead but as commissioner gordon in this movie he has no time to die the da shoes are filled by peter sarsgaard while the penguin aka oz is heavily made up and completely unrecognisable colin farrell veteran actor john turturro is brilliant as mob boss carmine falcone only to be overshadowed by very creepy sadistic paul dano as the riddler even jim carrey off his meds could not muster up the evil dano delivers in this role the only role felt didn work is from andy serkis as alfred he felt more bodyguard than man servant and no class the batman is complete reimagining of this 80 year old legend sourcing from more contemporary comics watch out for the 60 batman references in the stately wayne mansion and in the theme tune when fighting goons plus the distinctive penguin waddle in one scene possibly foreshadowing the next instalment with this untouchables deniro inspired performance how do you outrun vengeance clearly not in maserati quattroporte1.0\tthe long runtime works in here because the story is stretched perfectly my one complaint is some of the pacing issues but thats it my favorite character besides batman was catwoman0.0\tone of the worst movies ever seen terrible all around casting sucked story sucked liberal agendas sucked makes you realize how good of batman christian bale was1.0\twell never doubt of the pattinson delivery but was very surprise how he give this dark side of batman love his work in this role soooo amazed1.0\twent to the theaters with friend of mine and watched this and he thought it was dark but thought it was amazing with sense terror nearly making me cry and dark premise the batman is unique near perfect masterpiece sure it incredibly long but movie like this needs to be hours long it also extremely entertaining and funny robert pattinson is better batman than michael keaton ever was the riddler is awesome villian the music sets the tone so well could go on but would break my fingers telling you this stuff when you could just go to the theater and watch it1.0\textremely dark and unique would love sequel it shows great acts through and is overall amazing pattinson gives us strong take better than afflecks and is more natural in the cowl1.0\tthis film is testament to action cinema in its primal form it shows off how far the word professional can go in this industry and it feeling you get throughout the entire movie the acting cinematography music sound choreography art design every possible facet of the filmmaking that went into this movie from anyone who touched it robert pattinson is my batman originally michael keaton for me but robert has the torch now matt reeves you did it you all did great job and thank you for making masterpiece1.0\tlike all the batman movies think this will be the one rewatch the least which probably means its the worst mean the clooney one was ridiculously bad but to funny extent where have seen it many times arnold cracks me up in that it feels like theres catwoman tv pilot in here and batman tv pilot here very good ones can wait to see the next episode of each of these tv shows except its supposed to be movie and don get who its for mean huge comic collector so liked seeing this version of batman come to life know this world all the actors were well cast and did well portraying these characters just don know what the average person gets from this like why is penguin even in this movie does the average moviegoer understand the complexities of gothams crime world to this extent that they get it it was more cool bunch of scenes than movie it built cool world for movie to someday exist in there tv show about catwoman fighting the mafia and then tv show about batman fighting riddler they both feel like setup for the next episode more than one movie it feels unfinished pattinsons emo batman is ok for the tone they re going for don care for his batman voice and don know if buy him as this super strong warrior but he not bad and the suit looks cool hope the next dozen episodes come out soon to wrap this up it good and fun but its not really standalone movie is my point1.0\tthe darkest of the batman has arrived helmed wonderfully by director matt reeves reeves film is clearly inspired by the work of david fincher as it clearly pays homage to movies like seven and zodiac it brought nice dark gritty aspect to the film we get batman whose not afraid to wear his make up robert pattinson delivers brilliant performance as the cape crusader he plays it with quiet whisper never fully letting his rage take over till the climax of the movie the batman is really detective story with batman and commissioner gordon played by one of hollywood most underrated actors jeffery wright the two of them make great team as neither trust anyone else but each other the team up together trying to bring down the riddler played by the brilliant paul dano he oscar worthy in the film and plays very compelling villain the rest of the performances are all great zoë kravitz is hands down the best cat women of all time kravitz and pattinson radiate chemistry and sexual tension they were great together colin farrell is unrecognizable as the penguin and gives pretty gross in good way performance was never bothered with the three hour run time and loved almost every second of the film the story is gripping and the cinematography is beautiful greg fraser deserves lot of praise for his camera work michael giacchino score plays every part of the film perfect it dark and intense but has its light and beautiful moments this and the dark knight are undoubtedly going to be compared still got to give it to the dark knight as the better film but this comes very close really loved this film and matt reeves and his crew deserve ton of praise want to see this again asap1.0\tdark atmosphere intense scoring detective style more batman public appearance not so much tech to show off and strong plot this batman movie will leave you different feel from the previous after you watch it0.0\tdark gritty broody disturbing at times and comes with short spanish lesson that teaches the audience the difference between el and la eyyyyy why you showin me this come ooooonnn1.0\tfirst of all the something in the way trailer got me fully on board the hype train an awesome trailer for sure and very cool that the song was in the movie couple times no origin story just batman two years into the job and here we go definitely good call none of the actors dropped the ball pattinson was great batman as knew he would be from the initial news of his casting believe was one of the few the limited screen time as bruce wayne is harder to judge but he played the recluse well still like bale the best as he played both batman and bruce in way that no one would suspect him as batman kravitz is my favourite catwoman since pfeiffer still can recognize farrell as penguin but he was awesome dano tapped into his there will be blood persona so no surprise he was excellent had harder time ignoring john turturro as being member of sector or jesus from the big lebowski but he did quite well too jeffrey wright is always money the film is long indeed but they took the time they needed to truly make this an action detective film it really focused on that aspect and as many have said gave it that se7en feel but also because of how dark and rainy it was throughout it primarily takes place in the slums of gotham contrary to the dark knight which seemed more upper class the darker dirtier corrupt side of gotham was good direction to take the dark knight is still my favourite batman movie but this could rank second in my book and at very least third1.0\tcinematic sequences mobster scheming dark story famous for gotham good duo of bat and cat but to me the show is stolen by the riddler and the penguin the soundtrack is good but bit repetitive nirvana has nice nostalgia but regret there wasnt time where felt the soundtrack carry me in the action overall vibe is very emo and stoic wish we had more time to feel and connect with bruce since most of the batman bruce sequences are rigid with few dialogues alfred saved bruce character by giving him more of human side wich was nice overall the best quality of the movie is the intrigue given by the riddler following his hints trying to guess as we follow batman in his hunt its nice since batman as his main role detective one great movie tho think the first nolan movies are still on top for me1.0\tthebatman will go down as one of the best comicbook films in long time the script performances set pieces visual storytelling was phenomenal robert pattinson shines as an emotional brooding batman next to paul dano terrifying riddler matt reeves modern masterpiece0.0\tno spoilers worst batman movie ever batman and robin was more entertaining than this movie to sum up the movie it was high school drama awkward silence soap opera followed by more awkward silence and repeat the script was written so badly that can really bash the casting edward was not bad choice to cast as batman however this batman is weakly designed what mean is prepare yourself for batman being reinvented if had describe this batman it would be like high schooler getting off from school putting on batman costume and saying going to fight crime george clooney batman was smarter than him love the riddler but didn like the look it was too much like scarecrow mixed with the saw movies colin as the penguin was great if they did anything right in this movie it was the penguin don understand why this movie was hyped up so much and no not troll came into this movie because of all the praises and what my brother said but don take my word for it prepare yourself for hours and more endings than the first lord of the rings that right this movie had several points where it could of ended like batman vs superman wanted to leave during the movie but the only thing that kept me from walking out was that wanted to have leg to stand on when write my review of the movie dc yet again fell way short hoping flash point will be better otherwise putting permanent ban on all future dc projects my ranking for batman movies batman 1989 batman begins dark knight batman returns dark knight rises batman forever batman adam west batman and robin batman vs superman and then this movie dc you disappointed me again1.0\tthe soundtrack cinematography and dark gritty tone of this film made it stray away from the superhero norms the unhinged grounded nature of batman was portrayed very well you get the sense he is more batman than bruce the batman film we ve always wanted0.0\twaited for this movie to get good for hours and 56 minutes the story line was so boring the entire thing the casting is horrendous just terrible the guy from black panther as alfred really andy dermis played an amazing villain in black panther but in this was boring unconvincing and simply didn fit the role robert pattinson as batman really he was not believable and didn convince me of the role couldn sell me on it even though he beefed up for the part he looked scrawny and should be more in movie like the notebook or soap opera he may be good robin but in no way batman then turtturo as falcone really great actor otherwise but not in this role cast in the completely wrong role and was not convincing then the riddler you couldn find someone other then young bill gates the scene where batman was flying in the air with the suit on the camera trick was last used in the 1050s couldn make it look more believable instead let strap on selfie stick and cut off the top part of his head and make it look like he flying unbelievable hype for such wack movie feel like most people are just so blinded by the hype they dont notice the boredom the unbelievably poor casting the lack of excitement the prolonged scenes to draw out the movie and make it as if there is some sort of suspense all three of the last batman series with christian bale had me enthralled and on the edge of my seat this one was not even close would watch it to see what the hype is about but don expect to be entertained1.0\twithout any spoilers will tell you this film is the essence of gotham everything about the movie has an originality that we haven seen in any other batman film to date there very rustic gritty and dark tone to the film which graciously fits the dark knight this movie is great in ways that other batman films aren my one suggestion is to go in with an open mind and leave with an open mind don compare it to other batman films this will never be nolan batman but it is the essence of who bruce wayne is and when you see this version of gotham promise you ll love it1.0\tas much as love the christopher nolan batman movies this version has really turned the darkness up and makes those films feels like an mcu production almost three hours long but didn feel anything like it as the story kept going and kept my attention the whole time pattinson is amazing as batman no ridiculous voices maybe not the best bruce wayne though and colin farrell is excellent as the penguin overall fantastic watch 10 101.0\tnot going to lie had some concerns about the final result of the batman especially considering my love hate relationship with director matt reeves filmography fortunately the problems ended up being minimal first of all it complicated for superhero movie to stand out these days not to mention film based on batman in the context surrounding this film the other interpretations of the character have been altered to appeal to more audiences it not necessarily negative thing it just created misconception of what he stood for to see such clear description of both bruce wayne and batman being detective dealing with his true identity representing the dynamisms between both alter egos and not painting them as heroes was exactly what was needed for narrative surrounding this character to feel fresh even though this is the batman that has existed since its foundations now entering the film completely these same factors that make up batman portrayal on the big screen work their execution feels heavily inspired by movies like zodiac and even saw reaching the point where scenes inspired by these two could ve very well been part of them it is as if we had to pay for that facade with lack of originality hiding in the background part of the reason didn feel very confident about this movie was because of the script at this point consider it forgivable to worry about bad script in superhero movie in the case of this film it has tendency to overexpose which becomes extremely annoying in the first 15 minutes additionally the final act could have worked but it doesn feel established enough for nearly hour movie part of my problem with the film stems from that however apart from those negative aspects the rest was pleasant surprise the editing doesn feel rough at all especially in action scenes which happens very frequently in films of this genre greig fraiser cinematography as usual takes full advantage of the narrative making almost every shot feel remarkable robert pattinson is impeccable as batman but exceptional as bruce wayne however especially highlight zoë kravitz who with this role truly shows her versatility as an actress although many people think otherwise it difficult to specify character study towards batman many times it necessary to use second or third installments as an additional resource however the batman managed to get the closest in contrast to any of these previous attempts that by itself is already an achievement1.0\tfilm that you have to see in the cinema otherwise the story is too long the pictures too gloomy the drama too big anyone who expects batman like the dark knight will certainly be disappointed here instead they are presented with gloomy sad batman the whole thing is more reminiscent of crime thriller than classic superhero film yes the film is good but it also has its weaknesses the hero and the characters whisper their dialogues sometimes very unbelievable and inappropriate but above all robert pattinson as batman sometimes seems bit ridiculous nevertheless his acting convinces with the fears and weaknesses of the superhero which come out very well here the atmosphere is reminiscent of david fincher se7en and is the absolute strength of the film just like the soundtrack and the good action scenes unfortunately this story which was drawn by the lamb is broken bit this film is definitely not one of the best superhero films but it is definitely good one and worth seeing guten morgen ich wollte nur kurz daran erinnern dass es sehr wichtig ist dass wir diese rechnungen heute weiterreichen der zeitliche druck ist wie gesagt nicht unsere schuld ich danke dir schon mal einen guten start in den tag david1.0\tthis has to be one of the best movies have ever seen definitely one of the best superhero movies have ever seen would not change thing about it bravo matt reeves and bravo robert pattinson1.0\tlike to start off by saying that movies that are 3h long must be seen multiple times to fully understand and enjoy the story moving on think director reeves got the atmosphere right while portraying an early inexperienced batman the graphics are amazing the shots the angles no shakycam probably the best batman movie when it comes to image quality things didn like there is lot of information present was hoping to see more emotion out of the character of batman wanted him to have stronger emotional response to riddler constant maneuvers like feeling trapped frustrated hopeless despair etc many things happen in this movie but you never get the chance to breathe and actually take the time to feel the moment nolan batman movies gave me this sense of righteousness and hope it left me with that adrenaline rush but when this movie pieces fell into their place didn get that massive satisfaction out of it also the movie shows lot of similarities with the movie se7en 1995 regardless the batman 2022 introduces new things like the use of gadgets beautiful graphics no shakycam good acting good tension slight humor unexpected moments there are lot of cool moments present in this movie wish there was more emotion in the film more show don tell scenes and some flashbacks to tie the story better but still it solid batman movie1.0\tas huge batman fan had wicked high expectations for the movie and it did not disappoint this is my favorite version of batman portrayed on the big screen can see people complaining it too long and maybe boring but they really showcase batman detective skills and working with others which is great they gave batman way more screen time than bruce wayne which loved because want to see batman on the screen as much as possible his chemistry with jim gordon and catwoman were awesome to see paul dano riddler steals the show with some of his scenes which doesn surprise me because he talented actor the movie was very dark which like for batman movies the acting was great by everyone pattinson didn overdue the voice like bale did which is plus and it left me with wanting to see more can wait for the next one1.0\thad high expectations from this film and can say tonight after watched the movie that it did not disappoint bot ven for second and actually has some epic moments in it that noone of the first batman movie ever had actually not even the nolan trilogy had this one is different really can wait to see the 2nd installment of this film and really hope this to go on for at least movies with start loke this damn hope that they don rush all the famous villains in the next movies and end it until the next reboot this batman think it can stay for the long ride evolve and become something that was never done before the cinematography is amazing actors are amazing everything about this movie is top class noir thriller drama with some action and emotions sprinkled just the right amount1.0\tthis is unlike any batman that we have seen before on the big screen this movie shows great balance of crime mystery and action adventure battinson is more emotionally broken bruce wayne and it blends well with the overall darker tone of the movie excited to see where they take this new batman next1.0\tdidn think it would be possible but this batman is as good or nearly as good as nolan batman very powerful movie making don let the hour runtime stop you from watching it needs hours to give sumptuous well thought out story its just due this one will go in my 4k collection0.0\thours is long this movie should not be that long robert pattinson was ok as batman paul dano was terrible as the bad guy riddler never liked this actor like that they showed the other side of batman vulnerable with phycological issues and some super creamy bokeh night scenes zoë kravitz as catwoman super meh also there where too many mumbo jumbo scenes that favored the scenario of the movie that didn make any sense skip this movie christian bale was the best batman ever and the the dark knight 2008 was the best batman movie ever1.0\tthe best batman movie after christopher nolan the dark knight rises it had great fight scenes music and acting it also had some great ideas but think they could ve been executed better for example from the film got strong horror movie vibe and wish they would ve made it even more like that but regardless of this kind of negative remark really enjoyed this new batman it was solid film all around with great plot and the most exciting thing was that they used villain we hadn seen for some time in batman movie it was very long but personally didn get bored during this film it was very close though1.0\tokay ve always had doubts about pattinson as batman but ve got to say robert really outdid himself in this movie it so interesting to watch the dark theme really help the movie lot it the batman movie ve been waiting for since nolan trilogy ended it true masterpiece kudos to matt reeves really can wait for the batman sequels he got planned1.0\tsurprisingly good action amid plenty of slow dialogue nicely shot though long inconsistent ranges widely the batman best moments are refreshing and effective its worst moments are heavy handed and predictable it appropriately uses stylistic ideas from older style films albeit with lesser amount of depth and nuance the batman is strengthened by its way of respecting the lore while necessarily taking its own spin on it gotham city and its characters are generally well portrayed with its convincing tone and aesthetic this manages to be the best batman movie since the dark knight trilogy and better than many dc film efforts enjoyment critique 25 total 75 101.0\tthe movie bad blah blah blah remember heath the guy who has taken the oscar after the world said that he is going to fail robert will take it after some people hated him but now he is their batman after christian bale now am seeing this they are comparing between him and christian bale the riddler also was crazy and great choice for paul catwoman and batman here had beautiful chemistry and charisma collin farrel was the best choice for penguin the movie is masterpiece nothing more go and watch0.0\tstayed watching for three things zoey was so cute and sexy as ever robert was great doing his thing playing dark disturbed troubled soul as always the visual was stunning the story was boooooring probably the worst rendition of batman including lots of those anime batman features as film don quite know what to make of it thought the tv series gotham was the worst this one definitely top that for sure phuleeese just don make any sequels1.0\tthe best batman movie deep and dark movie that holds you from start to finish could be 5h cut that would love to see congratulations to the director and actors0.0\tdidn like it the movie just wasn good was very hyped when announced but disappointed when watched it there are so many praising reviews because they are just fans of the character1.0\tto start out with the movie was insanely comic book accurate while keeping realistic feel to it every single scene could be iconic perfect cinematography perfect castings perfect everything1.0\tloved everything about this film the trailers made it about batman relationship with catwoman but what really stood out to me was batman relationship with gordon do wish there was more of relationship between alfred and bruce wayne throughout the film though the riddler was an incredible character and dano played him perfectly the casting couldn have been better1.0\tthe batman is so damn good robert pattinson calm yet dark poised yet aggressive portrayal of the batman is very memorable the film was actually fast paced and the individual story of each of the characters is beautifully unique and yet warped with each other in mesh like entangled fashion but what stays with you long after watching the movie is robert pattinson he has played the role with brilliant combination of contrasts calm yet aggressive poised yet hungry for justice vigilante yet someone who wants love am reminded of how felt when watched robert pattinson for the first time on big screen as cedric diggory in harry potter and the goblet of fire the awe the feeling that your heart has been captured is back with robert pattinson in the batman1.0\texcept climax everything is perfect you will be glued to your seats piece of advice please watch it in theaters on big screen with dolby digital surround sound that where you will feel the most intense impact given by this movie this movie is dark villain is intense psychotic and powerful background music of the movie will give you goosebumps go watch and have fun edit watched second time on bookmyshow stream in hindi you got to avoid hindrance to attention for this movie pr phir bhi ghar mai lete hue tv mai dekhne ka bhi alag hi maza hai1.0\tthis movie has great plot wonderful characters and awesome action scenes batman is very young and badass catwoman is cool and badass too the riddler is great villain and is also kind of scary it beautiful movie and the perfect batman movie an absolute masterpiece1.0\tmust start off by stating that batman is my all time favorite comic character by miles the good cinematography settings supporting cast the bad musical score some dialogue bruce wayne journal entries probably my favorite depiction of gotham in any batman movie very similar to nolan but bit more comic accurate imo the supporting cast was phenomenal every last one thought that pattinson did very good batman but his bruce wayne was bit on the weak side for me affleck is still the best all round batman bruce wayne fight me the score was mixed bag the use of something in the way worked magnificently in the trailer but outside of the nostalgic value fell flat as per use in the beginning and the end using such an iconic lyrical song over bruce journal entry was also distracting the language used in the entry could also have been more polished there were also competing tones throughout the score and it unbalanced the story somewhat are we watching thriller romance hero journey there were simply too many movements in different directions that never got tied together by any one thing in particular maybe reeves could have looked at simplistic reworking of elfman theme comprising basic elements to demonstrate the protagonist growth all in all dynamic effort by reeves and co and would like to see more however and very much like nolan wouldn want to see this batman thrust into shared universe with other heroes pattinson batman is certainly stand alone figure and that ok too stylistically reeves really captures the tone for the movie that he set out to make however there are dangerous similarities to fincher se7en throughout he may have been better off adapting the hush storyline tbh to the trained eye this actually comes off as bit plagiarized would ve been 10 if not for the score issues and the blatant similarities to se7en but alas dropped to an 10 music and originality matter1.0\thave to admit after seeing the casting list and being such huge fan of batman wasn super hyped then the trailer came out definitely got little excited then but sitting in the theatre watching this masterpiece by matt reeves was truly blown away robert patterson is by far my favourite iteration of batman he truly brought different depth to the character and the chemistry he had with every other cast mate was astounding zoë kravitz is an amazing cat woman with the confidence and skill just as portrayed in the arkham games the main villain the riddler was amazing paul dano made this character competitor to heath ledger joker performance he made the riddler more than just red head in green tights but man to be feared and complete lunatic honestly overall my favourite cbm to date0.0\tdon know how you make batman film so boring but matt reeves managed it long slow and poorly cast with the exception of jim gordon who stole every scene he was in batman is all about the villains none are worth mentioning here1.0\tat first was not sure about the actor but then realized he is actually good the movie is almost hours it was very engaging fun exciting didnt feel bored or the need for it to finish it felt balanced between action detective skills story telling his character reflected his dark side yet he managed to convey alot of emotions by his eyes it almost reflect his human side along with his past and the fight within its really good movie only one little flaw maybe alot of people will not notice but do timing how some character appear ull know what mean when watch the movie1.0\tbravo this is made for this decade of batman has darkness to it that is different than all batman in the past brings out seven psychological thriller movie from the 90s within the dc world the riddler gives creepy feel of real life psychopath again bravo1.0\twithout going into the movie with too much expectation must say was satisfied walking out the dialogue story characters build up all were done very well the real star here though is the cinematography the dark dreary essence was captured very well the camera work was beautiful and so many frames were breathtaking what could of make it 10 10 rating you could tell there were parts and ways that the pg 13 held the film back subtract 20 25minutes of dialogue and add more action riddler or penguin scenes was paul dano budget too high to add more not sure great film held back by pg 13 rating and too little riddler penguin also the white privilege dialogue was pretty forced and kind of cringe1.0\tve been lifelong batman fan grew up with adam west truly fell in love as kid collecting comics and the 89 burton batman this was probably the most enjoyable batman film ve weber seen the casting was perfect jeffery wright made you believe every line he said the connection between robert patterson and zoe kravitz was undeniable great noir feeling mystery with batman as the protagonist the only negative found in it as great as pattinson was as batman was in my opinion he was very brooding as bruce wayne abd not as charismatic and elite acting as would have hoped for however based on the time period as batman is still trying to figure out his true role as crime fighter it did fit with the well developed plot it wasn typical origin batman story but told true tell of the batman outstanding work look forward to more from this combination of players1.0\tthank you matt for bringing back the dc adult and dark tone and more importantly an interesting and relatable story and showing that when director cares and understands the character and universe and what adults want not this disney marvel star wars woke slap stick comedy routine and cgi green screen this film brought me back to style and wasn ruined by cgi cut scenes and stupid comedy in but message actions have consequences no matter what look fiwrad to the next film but worrying of studio interference the film may upset marvel fans give me more and more of the style and story telling in comics and matt if you re reading comics look up spawn1.0\twhat movie loved the darkness and realism on this one very down to earth and the plot was soo good this is my favorite batman movie now followed closelly by the dark knight1.0\tan amazing movie that has your attention the whole hours fight scenes feel so real great story with twists pattison was good and riddler and penguin steal the show and what an amazing soundtrack if you saw the movie and it hasnt stuck in your head you are lying im going to see it again today thank you matt reeves for this masterpiece0.0\tsadly no content provided no emotions no deep relationships no interesting or mystery characters no character identification no thrill cheap story with plot holes unbelievable decisions antagonists motivation was unbelievable and old known pattern nothing new or interesting genre felt like crime detective but there was no action no drama and no thrill in crime genre you typically try to figure out some mysterious events as viewer but here you cant why no thrill because there was not any side character you wanted to protect or who got in danger ok remember some mediocre action why no drama because there were no inner or social conflicts lot of black dark screen no comedy at all aspects which are not necessarily negative but with that improved the movie could have gotten at least some identity acting cinematography and sound were good but that doesnt keep me awake dont care about nice looking special effects1.0\tthe movie has an amazing series of events although there no character buildup whatsoever screenplay is dark compared to recent movies ps the movie is optimized for imax however there no larger aspect ratio0.0\tthis movie sucked have no idea why people are liking it so much if wanted to watch seven would go and rewatch seven this is wb new formula just copy an old movie and put comic book character in it joker taxi driver the batman seven how are people falling for this this movie won age well maybe just getting old but trying to be too realistic in comic book movie just makes man wearing batman custom look stupid it was almost comical when batman tried to act like wearing bat custom was normal batman is suppose to be an ideal that the people in gotham can look up to that lurks in the shadows this one spends lot of time with people wearing bat custom why wear custom at that stage this batman was weak did he even beat the riddler in this movie don even know who won the conflict1.0\tavoided quite lot about this film and didn want to get hyped up really enjoyed the film and it was worth the wait robert pattinson really knocked it out the park and played really good batman if you dislike this film then you don understand it watch it again with different mindset and see how you go1.0\tit was no dark knight but it was very well done there were good performances by everyone involved the only flaw to this movie was it length it was reminiscent to return of the king as kept thinking that it was going to end and it didn like said enjoyed it but feel like things should ve ended with the dark knight trilogy 101.0\tthe batman is dark intense thriller that is action packed and full of twists and turns can help but feel that this film is visually stunning and the sound is outstanding parts of the film really gripped me in the cinema you will have to watch to find out robert patinson delivers an excellent performance and really stands out as one of the best batman we have seen on the big screen scenes filmed in liverpool really do this film credit and provides the local fandom with exciting tones recommended for all comic fans and those who want thriller of riddles0.0\tthen batman beats up bunch of january level social media trolls with guns at madison square garden and that the climax of the movie this was boring as hell1.0\twaited for this for year with super high anticipations and this film delivers everything grew up with batman all my life would say this is like fantastic hours se7en film we wanted do enjoy the fun cgi feast marvel films but its time to step out of that comfort zone and experience this neo noir comic instead pattinson did great job think he the best actor to play this part nowadays knowing he would be great after seeing tenet and weak film the good times paul dano is my riddler and he fantastic actor check out his acting in prisoners there will be blood the little miss sunshine and looper the penguin was treat and still cannot believe it the pretty boy colin farrell zoe did great job as catwomen and would love to see more of her matt reeves phenomenal talent director and so glad he took this project rather than stiff affleck continue with the yawnfest dceu the director films seems to get better as the time goes on the film is long and darkest batman and still not wanted to end love the way it explored gotham with slow pacing and all the actions were jaw dropping especially the close up car chase don want to spoil anything cos if do this review would takes days to read go and enjoy it under 15s would probably not enjoy it as much still can make up my mind if it the batman need watch it again pre ordered the 4k two sequels tv series and more jokers films future looking good for the batman universe forget the other of the dim dc characters keep up the fantastic work and looking forward to your visions matt reeves hope we have villains in the sequels that does deserves better recognitions can wait batman 89 great with boring bits 10 batman returns great visual until silly 3rd act 10 batman forever silly and watchable 10 batman robin terrible had its few moments 10 batman begins great origin 10 the dark knight near perfect film 10 10 the dark knight rises messy conclusion 10 batman vs superman worst batman imo 10 suicide squad suitable as saturday morning tv film 10 justice league extremely forgettable 10 joker totally different take in dc in gritty good way 100.0\tthe biggest set back of this movie is batman or bruce wayne himself this version of bruce wayne is insecure pussy know that bruce wayne was never really meant to be typical charismatic hero but this this bruce wayne is so socially awkward weird felt ryan gosling was playing bruce wayne bruce wayne should be charismatic confident at least when he out in the public making bruce wayne this much awkward weird completely redefines he character but not in good way would love this character if this was holy original character but completely reinvent well established character pissed me off it like not making james bond playboy batman don have single memorable punchline in the whole movie the batmobile also sucked this is the wrost live action batmobile ve ever seen didn liked the relationship between bruce alfred either bruce is almost disrespectful to alfred mean wtf this movie shat on batman 82 years of legacy changing so many core elements of well established character is not cool if you wanna do something then create original character don destroy well established character with great legacy1.0\tthis movie reminded me lot of roman polanski chinatown lonely man batman in search of solving the crimes that pollute the city consider it one of the best proposals to date for batman excited to see the next movies and see how they develop all characters do consider this better than christopher nolan no since it is very different directing style and nolan managed to capture the audience with great performances and writting what do see better in this new movie is the cinematography truly majestic job0.0\tdon know who is paying all these people to give this good review but please stop laughable couldn even take the soundtrack seriously when half the time you are expecting death vader to show up latest spider man was good this is half baked exercise in no character development visuals that added nothing to the story and total waste of alfred john turturro and zoe kravitz are the most redeeming characters and penguin1.0\tthe dark knight the batman what can say about this movie that wasn treat to watch robert pattinson as bruce wayne and zoe kravitz as selina kyle had such great chemistry it felt like it was ripped from the comics themselves as for story it was very much more dark and reality based batman in which batman faces the enigmatic and psychotic take on the riddler played by paul dano who uses the power of social media and viral videos to lead batman on the hunt for him with the help of james gordon played by jeffery wright the cinematography of grieg fraser is fantastic bring the caped crusader to life in his year outing as batman and every frame felt like painting personally felt this to be little long with how big the story was but it needed to be told this way because for years batman has been all action with very little detective work his monicure is the worlds greatest detective after all wasn fan of colin ferrell penquin because he felt like wanna be italian gangster without actually being intimitating but rather annoying1.0\tthis is the batman think there won be better batman film matt reeves has outdone himself beautiful cinematography amazing composition the score by michael giacchino it so pleasant to the ear as what you see on the screen the performance by robert pattinson as the batman couldn ask more from him you should definitely watch this film is beautiful and it vengeance0.0\tto rate this above 10 is criminal activity batman himself ought to investigate enjoyed this 2022 batman somewhat but only in parts liked the cast great deal and all the characters but some of the performances suffered due to poor and often times cringe worthy lines and reactions batman actually doing research and detective work was change of pace and could have added something positive to the film but it just made it more boring the lead was given long moments of self reflection through narration and again boring the movie missed the mark and desired effect because it was either poorly timed or overly used really wanted to love the heck out the batman 2022 but it sucked pretty hard the nolan trilogy was far and away cut above this in every way possible1.0\trobert pattinson takes on the famous cape in city scared and suspicious of the caped crusader who hasn done much for years commissioner gordon calls him in as villain the riddler is killing off top politicians after the superhero comic years of nolan and burton it interesting to see this dark sinister shadowy world of this new version which works exceptionally well and lot better than the snyder wheddon films pattinson is really good as grim troubled bruce wayne who gets involved with many fabulous characters who here are merely crazed criminals no comic book outfits here nevertheless they impress particularly dano as the riddler the story is long one at hours but it strong inventive character driven tale with some first rate performances and some excellent imaginative action set pieces it has great score but above all this it is its one of the most outstandingly cinematic film in years along with dune all black and orange hues with glorious set decoration and powerful vistas reminded me little of sin city terrific stuff ps hard not to comment on colin farrell as the penguin you won know it him either through look or voice such that you have to query why they hired him good turn though1.0\twhen you watch movies with crowd in brooklyn you can feel the emotion and tension of the scenes this movie was lot better than what expected really hope they keep this franchise going for while1.0\tvery long movie but personally don think it wastes any time setting up and telling the story visuals and music were top notch pattinson was pretty good as bats but the side characters really shined especially kravitz as cat woman and wright as gordon definitely the most grounded batman movie ever made hopefully this new gotham can continue to expand in the future especially with batman rogues list1.0\tloved this film and like majority of people who saw this film in theaters left thinking was kurt cobain robert pattinson speaking of kurt cobain the music choice in this film something in the way by nirvana was great apparently the director of the batman matt reeves listened to nirvana while writing the script for batman and actually based robert pattinson bruce wayne on kurt cobain the casting choices were amazing catwoman played by zoë kravitz was huge step up from christopher nolan catwoman the penguin was great character actually enjoyed him more than the riddler colin farrell did great job as far as the riddler played by paul dani goes thought he was great definitely huge step up from the riddlers previous goofy personas robert pattinson was great batman but personally enjoy christian bale more because biased but overall this is great film and definitely must watch1.0\tit absolutely fantastic dark and moody from the get go complemented with great score that really sets the atmosphere throughout the cast were all outstanding patterson made fantastic batman paul dano performance as the riddler was spine chillingly menacing everyone was perfectly cast my only complaint is that it was maybe 30 mins too long the ending was tad drawn out despite it being tad long it solid1.0\triddler penguin and catwoman love how the movie had no origin robert pattinson is great batman love how the movie made him detective and not only justice and vengeance riddler was the tool to uncover gotham corruption bringing the rat in to the light each character was great the acts was getting bigger and better nothing felt under used the dark knight is still my all time favorite heath ledger joker still makes me think he is great villain hans zimmer music makes the movie amazing christopher nolan directing from beginning to the end was flawless the ending with the this new movie felt pretty long certain parts can not understand why it needed to be slow almost fell asleep at least it was better than batman returns batman forever batman robin batman begins and the dark knight rises not being biased but the story was better1.0\tyoung batman still learning the ropes uncovering how dirty and dark gotham really is enjoyed this movie for what it was even if it felt really depressing at times the setting gave you sense of lost hope and the villains felt right at home if you are fan of batman and the dark knight trilogy you will enjoy this one too to date this is the best batman riddler movie have seen solid 10 for me1.0\twas wary when pattinson and kravitz were given the lead roles but they were both so good it was great story sometimes wondered if could be shorter than the three hours but they were all needed very well made well acted and good story0.0\tthe whole thing makes zero sense the batman is like super sensitive who would be disappointed about the death of low life reporter who acts like someone mental illness is mark against them that is just awful how could someone not care about their own mom and the cat woman chick is just so stupid she just walks around asking for her lost friend or something dont know fell asleep but the worst thing is that there is no action at all just people complaining and crying accusing and generally acting like they are in soap opera omg was this annoying cat woman was really awful she needed to pick being selfish or being righteous not both she could care less about everyone except her freind but then she wants to act like her feign was super special just everyone discussing their feelings non stop this may as well be twilight1.0\tcannot think of time walked out of movie having headache it was breathtakingly exhilarating piece true masterpiece robert pattinson is the ultimate batman0.0\twhy is it mostly filmed in the dark so you can see what happening this looked like teenager filmed it on budget mobile phone everyone whispering so you turn up the volume then the next moment excessively loud everyone is in slow motion that why the film is so long this is one of the worst films ve ever seen if not the worst batman has always been ridiculous put on rubber suit and suddenly you will have super powers omg0.0\tthis is one of the worst movies ever made for god sake whoever gaslight the movie please remove this movie fro the dceu this movie needs to be erased completely1.0\twaited for this type of new batman or should say the real batman noir dark detective story that grips you for hrs all the casts have done great job near perfect direction bgm cinematography presentation of the gotham city is at it very best the only drawback of this movie is lack of enough action moments as superhero film0.0\tpros acting was good despite the pre thoughts of the cast the soundtrack was ok guess cons too long depressing with humor or comedic relief too dark some scenes you can barely see wtf going on batman too emotional instead of being cool calm collected also bruce wayne childhood storyline is ass imo don wanna give any spoilers but real fans will know right away riddler outfit you ll see what mean smfh riddlers not smart witty like we re used to instead he more mentally unstable which threw off the movie vibe not too happy with this batman considering they had 10 years1.0\tthe best batman for me yet came into the cinema not knowing what to expect as it is detective film but soon into the film realised it was packed with action and surprises one thing that definitely was different was skipping an origin story and moving straight away into batman 2nd year of crime fighting all the actors were exceptional after being doubted robert pattinson proved all his haters wrong saying he was the right choice for batman reeves portrayal of this bruce wayne is definitely more tone and dark showing him to be some sort of emo zoe kravitz played an amazing selina kyle having great chemistry with the batman in the film paul dano also nailed his role as the riddler creating whole new interpretation for him as psychotic devious person targeting high end gotham figures must watch for all1.0\tbatman is one of those rare characters who works well for the audience half the time despite alternate iterations however we ve never seen fully fleshed out detective batman in live action there were bits in the dark knight where he investigates the fingerprint on the bullet and also in that same film batman had an entire sequence where he saves the hostages and carefully neutralizes swat team it perfectly captured how good of strategist he is arguably the best batman action sequence put to film along with the warehouse scene from bvs but apart from these two segments we ve never seen batman who collected evidences and solved crimes using his mind and not just the fist he the world greatest detective afterall enter matt reeves the batman true batman fans will thoroughly enjoy the batman stunning visuals great acting an amazing ost and story which is the comic book cousin of david fincher se7en this movie is told in very compelling manner for the most part the film may be long but can assure you that two thirds of the film was so breezy and extremely engaging it year two batman story so it not quite the origin story like batman begins but still offers so much room for character development it was such genius move as it brings some level of freshness required some audiences may not be quite used to this storytelling due to its neo noir take but that comes down to your preference of superhero cinema this is not superhero film where you can sit down for colourful visuals regular humour and massive cgi action as good as some of those movies can be this is dark tale which sinks your mind into the brutal nature of gotham city and yes this version of batman perfectly captures the essense of how year batman should be like imo future films will only give broader character development it does have minor flaws like any film but the film is consistently good for the most part to leave you satisfied the dark knight set the standards for how good superhero movies can be the batman continues to follow that standard by giving us more comic accurate version of gotham city with slightly more reckless version of batman compared to nolan trilogy would definitely watch this film again my ranking of batman films top the dark knight one of the best films ever batman begins incredible origin tale the batman the detective vigilante we needed mask of the phantasm damn good film zack snyder jl batman who is leader the dark knight rises didn make the top but it still very good film bvs ultimate edition has an elseworlds take on batman which is decent but if wanted batman content which truly captures the essense of batman would turn to the top rankings ve mentioned above make sure you catch the batman at the biggest imax screen possible1.0\tthe way each shot is lit the way pattinsons body language changes whenever he bruce or batman the way all the characters have this chemistry it all just works this all shows me that the people who worked on this give damn on what they made the story is possibly some of the best from batman movie and loved seeing the detective side of him we still get brutal and awesome action sequences but it nice to slow the pace down when he solving the riddles the riddler was so scary because it believable it believable that someone could do what he did in this world and gotham is amazing it really hell on earth and they show you my only problem was the pacing but even that was only small thing that didn deter from the movie at all please watch this if you like batman dc superheroes crime movies or action in general0.0\tstubid movie no light no sun dark scene very poor baget stubid batman car very cheap cenario began to hate batman very long movie alot of scenes are not needed iam very sepriced that it took ascore of my advise to you dont see it very boring0.0\tthis movie is an extremely dark pointless and violent mess worse than most all the previous batman films all the actors whisper their lines and there is weak attempt to connect all the violence to something bruce wayne dad did the riddler is presented for the first time we completely without humor and sarcasm for some reason colin farrell is featured as completely unrecognizable penguin you can even tell he played by farrell chaotic mess1.0\tbatman has been character that has received many many big screen adaptations ve always loved the character and the story of bruce wayne so ll always flock out to see these stories with that said still wasn over the moon excited about this one simply because of the current abundance of batman right now however was very happy to hear that it would be story on its own without single connection to other franchises going in with that mindset felt like breath of fresh air to me also happy to say that it easily one of the best iterations of the character yet even though there are aspects that kept me from completely loving it here why the batman should be seen in theatres picking up two years after he has dawned the cape and cowl batman bruce wayne robert pattinson is on the move with lt james gordon jeffrey wright discovering that serial killer by the name of the riddler paul dano has been killing politicians around the city all they have to go on is the clues and riddles he so elegantly leaves behind it like he wants to be caught but also wants to do everything to outsmart everyone from family ties to surprising love interests this three hour epic superhero film has lot happening nearly always in the batman costume for the entire runtime this is the most on screen batman we ve probably gotten in film ever with the solid addition of zoe kravitz as selina kyle catwoman the comradery romance that sparks between kravitz and pattinson was incredibly electric this wasn surprise to me though because director matt reeves has proven that he real actors director his work in the past has always impressed me and even though don think the batman is quite as good as his planet of the apes films it damn close this may seem like giant nitpick but it hard not to ignore nearly every character and storyline have been pursued in one way or another in other versions of batman on screen felt that that aspect actually made the film feel slower than it actually was at three hours never found myself bored but the slow pacing on top of knowing lot that was going to happen already made the film feel slightly off other than that though this film is impeccably made if you can get past the fact that this character has been told this way many times now it really is fantastic piece of filmmaking overall the batman isn the type of film that will gush out of my mind about because there are other great batman movies out there that believe are better with that said for what this film was trying to be detective noir story that just happens to be about the pantheon of batman characters it great robert pattinson was an absolute highlight as the character of bruce wayne the character hasn really been on screen this way visibly before and admired that the most it was also far more realistic than any batman film that has come before it can wait for the subsequent films to come because much like the dark knight was to batman begins believe reeves can make far superior sequel to this the batman is now playing in theatres and think it more than worth your time0.0\twas looking forward to watching this movie but the movie ended up total let down the cinematography was great but the story line was dragged out with not to much action1.0\twhere to start this is more on the same level as thrillers such as seven than comic book movie every actor nails their part it gritty brutal and filmed perfectly to express the tone and the music god damn its atmospheric cobains vocals on something in the way as pitch perfect for the feel reeves sets out every time batman comes into play the base tones of the song kick in we could well have new batman theme music contender here and robert pattinson is an excellent year batman feel gonna have to give this film multiple watches just to pick up on everything brilliant1.0\tthe only problem is length of movie make sure you choose good cinema with comfortable seats then relax and enjoy movie this is the best movie of 2022 so far and 2nd best after dark knight0.0\tits good thrilling detective movie riddler was awesome batman could have been another hero with different costume and the movie would have still worked out good story and actors nothing more1.0\tthe batman was film that deserved to be given an excellent rating couldn think of anything negative to say about it it enthralling and raw with mystical allure and endearing charm not usually fan of the genre but was so caught away by the film beauty that felt it deserved 10 stars1.0\tmatt reeves the batman is darker than the dark knight trilogy and has an incredible amount of pouring rain night scenes full of action and remarkably gripping car chase in these dark and rainy conditions don expect too much sunshine watching this film robert pattinson is reclusive gaunt and detached bruce wayne stark departure from the affluent socialite portrayed in batman films from years past pattinson reminded me far more of howard hughes in the aviator than of christian bale in the dark knight trilogy it an intriguing new take on this protagonist who always seemed like he was on his way to gala whenever he was not in his other element as the caped crusader pattinson is quite good in this version and it hopefully sign of more good things to come he is backed by powerful supporting cast including but not limited to sultry zoe kravitz as catwoman fierce but also vulnerable heroine who has seen her share of hardship an utterly unrecognizable colin farrell as penguin it could have been another actor and you wouldn be able to tell the difference and disquietingly creepy paul dano as the riddler who slowly reveals himself to be gotham worst nightmare but whose indignation over gotham corruption lends his character shred of righteous anger the riddler tormenting puzzles and menacing voice are compelling enough to evoke the image of the zodiac killer jeffrey wright is well deployed as commissioner gordon the tireless but harried ally of the vigilante finally john turturro makes great turn as carmine falcone the powerful crime boss whose grip over the city is almost unmatched overall this adaptation is well made as whole little long clocking in at almost three hours even with its length it still finishes very strong with courageously anguished conclusion and one that perfectly conveys this superhero resolve in the face of catastrophe the batman is great entertainment for everyone huge fans as well as newcomers to the dc universe1.0\tgreat raw film without sauces like classic comic book joker level film the same atmosphere aggression and psycho the best batman the plot has gradient action and real features the main negative character is well played0.0\tfelt sleep during the movie it was so unnecessary long know batman is not like strongest superhero but in this movie he was so baaaad wanna give you zero but it not possible so give one0.0\tthe worst batman batboy music was awesome but that it to begin with poor cinematography and camera angles even in 4k movie is too grainy looks like remastered 80s and chase scenes were mostly limited to first person views too narrative and boring plot this should be batman movie not murder mystery enjoyed the batman cartoon way more than this even die hard bat man fans fell sleep during the long unnecessary dialogues batboy in action batman was always mature adult who can read people very well and was also very careful not to blow his cover bruise wayne was playboy who was always happy but this new batboy is always depressed even when he was wayne pattyboy factor sorry to say pattinson failed to deliver the batman role that we expect his personality is too filmsy and he was given exactly similar scenes to dark knight where is he despite he still looks depressed don wanna talk about the batmobile may be wrong may be dark knight wasn the real batman lol1.0\tyaaaa wrote it like that kept having se7en flashbacks can be the only one also the movie is 7olid loved the nirvana coda the big fat red the batman title yeah titles are important and of course gotham believe in gotham gotham is beautiful we all live there no zoe is lovely to watch rob patterson jaw is worthy of the mask and the car chase gave me some real sweet anxiety was white knuckled thumbs up to all of that but robpat was little boring to me maybe some bigger pores would add complexity know batman is guarded but why so serious think can conclude only really like the keaton batman so always disappointed throughout the years the batman has become such drip and the bad guys have become little too human they are just gansters now nothing fantastical about them but why not it still comic book right if suspending my belief for all these other components to move the story along then give the penguin cool umbrella gun or something the whole movie made me ache with nostalgia miss the costumed baddies bedazzled weapons forged in wet basement labs funded by dark money toxic waste accidents that give the fringes the super powers they deserve the riddler and the penguin were just people did enjoy farrell penguin there should have been much more scripted for him those scenes were quite short have hard time remembering who filled up those hours but it wasn the penguin there was mystery to solve guess but did really care about that the riddles weren particularly creative see it in theater see it in dolby say see it vigilantism feels good right now but come on its little bloated1.0\tin my opinion this movie is amazing liked every thing about it the story is interesting and feels like the combination of detective movie and super hero movie every character is intriguing and the actors do an amazing work as these characters especially liked the riddler who acts like real psychopath and batman who the smartest batman yet in my opinion to appear on the big screenand as everybody already said he realy is the world greatest detective the atmosphere is dark and gritty it can feel like horror movie at times also the action is well coriograft and feels great this is masterpiece0.0\trecommend anyone who will watch this movie in cinema bring blanket with you its too long and too bored the movie is not good as dark knight recommend anyone who will watch this movie in cinema bring blanket with you its too long and too bored the movie is not good as dark knight0.0\tas batman pattinson was fine as bruce wayne that different story probably overly critical but don enjoy an emo bruce wayne for hours there wasn much fighting the little there was was good found myself rooting for the riddler towards the end because it was dragging on so much dc lame again1.0\tnot the best batman movie but still my favorite the dark knight was clearly deeper while the batman was trying pretty much to tell beautiful detective batman story and deliver message director of photography did also perfect job like the composr michael giacchino1.0\tanother even darker version of the batman since the dark knight trilogy the plot was great and the gotham city atmosphere has the dark arkham tone inspiration from the game paul dano plays as the maniac riddler which is amazing just like the late heath ledger as the joker can say paul dano roles is the second craziest villain after the joker in batman movies also zoë kravitz and colin farrell done great job with their characters thumbs ups give out of 10 due to my opinion1.0\tthe batman se convirtio en una de mis peliculas favoritas pesar de que dura casi horas mi no se me hizo larga es oscura siniestra realista hace mucho que no veía una pelicula de superheroes tan seria oscura como esta no es la tipica pelicula de superheroes es poco convencional eso me encanta mas que recomendada1.0\tmovie is good but it is too slow and some scene are too only editing is too bad not the best batman nolan trilogy remains the best after nolan zack snyder batman looks more mature leets see how they take this batman going forward wb is very dumb when they need cuts they dont come in to action when no need of cuts they put finger over all ok not the best1.0\tlet just take min think back of all the batman we have seen in the past they were always polished and ready for the fight where as this batman isn he makes you see more of struggling batman learning and having more failed attemps then successful this must be one of my favorite batman ever made will need to watch few more times but there is lot going on the twists that happen may change your views on the whole thing but yes give it 10 cause this is the most raw batman you ll ever see1.0\tthis movie is absolutely beautiful stunning and remarkable the story the acting and the execution were top notch it was dark brutal and is definitely there with the dark knight the riddler was the mvp or the movie1.0\tas close to hush as you can get incredible film makes marvel films look like toy story fingers crossed they make another to continue the perfection everything is believable instead of becoming heavy reliant on cgi like the marvel films do if you are fan of the dark comics then you won be disappointed0.0\tthe batman is not unwatchable but without question way too long too many times looked at my watch what else compared to burton and nolan visions of batman weak and uninspired1.0\tthe movie goes back to more classic batman opening with voiceover love it we get lot darker batman and gotham city than it was in dark knight triology and more rough batman robert pattinson does phenominal job in showing the fury of batman1.0\twas skeptical when the movie was first announced we ve had influx of the superhero genre for well over decade and have seen the dark knight portrayed few times in different iterations with that said this is in my opinion the single greatest batman film to date reeves and the crew made every detail matter and had gotham feel so immersive throughout the film subtle references to other batman stories as well as easter eggs setting up potential plot hooks for later movies was absolutely fantastic the cast was stellar from top to bottom pattinson honestly made bale batman seem so campy by proxy will be going to see this movie in theatres few more times for sure 10 10 with rice1.0\tpersonally enjoyed this movie like how slow and steady it was more comic book accurate wish there was even more scenes with the bat mobile because it was hella clean1.0\tmovie is masterpiece simple as thats that dano gave oscar winning perfomance the movie is the gold standard of comics genre this is how comicbokk movies should be made1.0\tamazing experience to watch this movie all the characters in this movie is incredible especially the riddler and how they portrait him and also the batman loved it1.0\tthis movie was incredible true masterpiece from director matt reeves one of the only times you can watch comic book movie and say it actually amazing with no cgi this film is incredibly shot with amazing performances all round amazing1.0\tthis is without exaggeration one of the best superhero movie of all time and the best batman movie of all time many people are definitely going to disagree but this is in my opinion better than tdk firstly pattinson was amazing as batman and bruce wayne he is my favourite portrayal of year batman he still hasn figured out how to be the happy and playboy bruce wayne he is depressed and haunted by his parents death he doesn really know how to show emotions to even the people that truly care about him he cares but his actions don portray it because he struggles to express how he feels as batman he is haunting and this is the first time we get to see him as batman in basically 95 of the movie and pattinson perfectly portrayed how bruce struggles with his identity and how batman feels more natural than bruce wayne for him paul dano was my absolute favourite in the movie he was downright terrifying scary and played mind games with batman loved the first time he meets batman in person was one of the absolute best scenes in any movie zoe karvitz was fantastic as catwoman selina kyle love her backstory and loved the chemistry between batman and catwoman you can see the genuine care for each other here andy serkis alfred pennyworth was my favourite portrayal of the character he is badass he cares for bruce wayne like every other version but from the dialogues felt like this version had the best connection with batman jeffry wright lt jim gordon was again my favourite version of the character he was smart and worked with batman most of the time loved his more angry and determined portrayal colin farrell as penguin oswald cobblepot oz was fantastic loved him and pretty sure everyone will agree when say this was the best version of penguin we got loved the make up and prosthetics and loved his acting and accent most of the characters aren their final version and this so still year batman gordon is lieutenant and not yet chief and penguin is still not exactly known by that name he doesn like being called that and refers to himself as oz every characters story arc was amazing the movie was filled with amazing plot and great acting michael giacchino score was fantastic my favourite batman theme of all time his music completed the movie and created an atmospheric experience1.0\tvery violent movie but its alright because it is complete story it is almost 180 minutes with slow noir hardcore going feeling in gotham city batman is filled with sad lonely touch in process but still the dark knight rider batmans gear vehicle is just punch at 100 all actors performs perfect diffrent batman movie at its best1.0\ttwilight should be distant memory and he more than proven himself in so many movies since twilight the man proved himself as the dark knight in spades as one who always hopes the bat actor has the physical qualifications say pattinson managed to bulk up to be bigger than christian bale as batman knowing that he had to meet specific size for his batsuit beyond that he perfectly encapsulated batman brooding and while the exact opposite of billionaire playboy bruce wayne he gave perfect performance as the occasionally scene in the comics despondent bruce wayne and matt reeves led him through an awesome and believable character arc from there as well pattinson was so convincing in his performing batman as the ultimate fighting machine and we finally get batman as true blue detective ll say we got satisfactory amount of andy serkis performance as alfred the batman gordon working relationship with spectacular gordon performance by jeffrey wright was stellar zoey kravitz was fantastic batman year one model of catwoman john turturro put an impressive stamp as carmine falcone paul dani was an uber menacing riddler and colin farrell gave us the mob boss penguin ve been waiting to see for eons we got believable homemade batmobile and great batman tech as well lastly we got an engaging story that was worth every minute of the near hours go see this movie1.0\thave to say that movie is all about the batman and the gotham city itself movie cinematography costumes dialogue all are crafted perfectly the most important part of the movie is the background music am not comparing but it was the best baground music had ever experienced in the cinema movie is thriller and mistry and if you are fan of detective movies then you will enjoy it must recommended from my side there is no nudity so you can watch it with your family and friends1.0\toverall it an entertaining crime movie the long run time is justified the villains were super well done in this movie the riddler and penguin were welcome change from an era that seen many versions of the joker the only fault is that this movie lacked strong bruce wayne character what we do see of pattinson wayne is bland and lifeless we don really get much of an idea of what he been doing with his personal life in the 20 years of taking over his family business we also barely see alfred and all that goes into the batman behind the scenes1.0\tthis movie was amazing as hell it was so well combined with the elements of horror tension and action all of the actors did an amazing job idk why some people think this movie is bad they say it bad cuz it was to dark and like duh it batman movie1.0\tvery interesting take on batman this is more grungy version from the nirvana music to the warriors streets of fire style of the city and street gangs to the mad max style car which was amazing must say the only time laughed during the movie was when one of the patrons in my screening feel asleep and started snoring felt for the poor girl next to him it isn boring at all found it fascinating and engrossing from the start and even though it does have long run time the film only intensifies through to its finale did notice few shots similar to the dark knight bit of high end karaoke film making as like to call it none the less this is well worth the price of cinema ticket0.0\tbad writing bad villains and bad cast everything in the movie was bad gave it out of 10 only because of music this what happens when you try to copy another masterpiece maybe only maybe if there was no dark knight movie then this movie will be acceptable0.0\twas excited to watch new batman but get disappointed 30 minute later get bored but 45 minutes later less action to much talk few actions like the car but no weapons it all about fiddler etc waste of time and money that my opinion1.0\tmatt reeves you freaking genius the cinematography of this movie is like blade runner 2049 mind blowing robert pattinson did great job as batman but the surprising thing is that zoe kravitz as catwoman and paul dano as riddler and collin farrel as penguin will shock you by there mind blowing performance the entire cast was perfect oh the music by michael giacchino is one of the best thing about this movie big recommend1.0\teveryone knows the back story of batman for the most part so we don need to revisit that aspect again and this movie was directed as such it gave more opportunities to explore the storyline of who batman really is which is the greatest detective and vigilante this batman was the darkest ve ever seen it and it was absolutely great this is the real batman not over the top human being who can do some superhero things with super powers would do and the details that went into this version of batman was insane from the eye makeup the quincentennial battle scene in the dark eye reactions like the cartoons just to name few love most batman movies and to my surprise this one tops them this one tops the dark knight by hair though that masterpiece in itself great acting on all fronts the cinematography was amazing how they brought batman into the light from the dark and vice versa couldn ask for better shots and angles top notch movie overall honestly will go see it again in the movie theater and then again at home with sub titles just so can capture anymore details of this amazing movie1.0\tmatt reeves combines good story with interesting characters and good fighting scenes the look of the movie is dark toned and pattinson is great as bruce wayne and batman wow it is not as good as the the dark knight but these are hard to compare so still give the batman 10 10 must watch0.0\thow this mess of movie gets rave reviews is beyond me from the outset the casting is shambles and the story what story so corny and predictable ok we know batman is dark but that dark with such mega budget surely they could have afforded one 100w bulb as for the the running time bladder sufferers beware at nigh on three hours you better lay off the overpriced drinks at least one can have decent nap however in short and at best 80 mins max would have been to long special effects very poor especially when our caped wimp is driving and on his bat bike as for the score overall pretty good albeit 80 sounds like stolen quality hans zimmer tracks one day somebody will make decent batman movie this most certainly is not and best described as very dark overlong episode of an old adam west tv episode without the laughs be honest folks the bale movies were classics compared to this over hyped tstorm1.0\tseven is one of the best movies ve ever watched and the batman being inspired by it was extremely right the movie is amazing and completely different from what we re used to if you can see it in cinema see it don miss this opportunity robert pattinson is the best batman in cinemas acting 10 script 10 direction 10 photography 10 soundtrack 10 production design 10 sound design 10 cast 10 thanks matt revees for the best batman0.0\ton the way out we genuinely had to step over several sleeping viewers this film is bore beyond comprehension remove the batman from this film and what you re left with is depressing and unimaginative attempt at neo noir the fact that there is an endeavour at reinventing the character warrants an extra star but giving new spin on batman doesn justify an accolade alone for film to be worth watching it surely has to have substance too sadly that something lacking here this has to be one of the worst films ve seen in long time certainly the worst ve paid to see once you move beyond the idea that batman isn quite the hero that you might imagine imperfect slight affected and running about in jerry rigged outfit all you re left with is dull and meandering plot complete lack of character development halting and uninspired screen play and an absence of any kind of acting or maybe it poor direction the best performance is certainly from collin farrell can begin to understand why anyone would rate this film above the only thing can assume is that people have become so accostomed to the terrible and lacklustre cinema that has plagued hollywood over the last 10 15 years that they think this is good example of something worth watching as far as concerned it solved the question of whether there any hope left for traditional cinema there isn1.0\tthis is batman film and has all the batman characteristics and this is the film we deserved since many years ago and robert pattinson it amazing as batman and paul dano as riddler does an amazing job1.0\tfrom the beginning to end was thrilled it great film and the camera along with the colors was so beautiful and the actors were great am surprised and loved it and that pattinson wanted to play the batman because he fan makes it special it little too long but this was filmmaking inspiration and will stay with me0.0\tdon expect anything near dark knight because it not going to meet your expectations definitely not for everyone it only making big money at the box office because it the new batman movie guarantee 80 percent of people are going to be disappointed absolute hollywood money grab1.0\tgreat movie again with good storie also again can not wait for next one great acting and storie line no spoilers in this review think does this fit or not doe toi tink0.0\tam huge fan of the batman character have watched and appreciated every batman movie released more than twice my favourites would be batman 1989 returns and the dark knight trilogy appreciate the others as well really like affleck from the snyderverse and his version now going forward with this film knew from the start that patinson is very miscast in this role but wanted to give the movie chance well was not wrong at all the guy gives miserable performance pattinson as batman it even worse than clooney the guy can act and his performance sucks in every scene he is in not to mention the fact that he has muscles on him and looks very puny and weak the guy refused to work out and it shows he looks like he hasn been at the gym day in his life no joke the costume is terrible and the batmobile is joke don want to get started on how bad the riddler looks very depressing movie and time waste this is the last chance gave to patinson movie is this movie better than batman robin maybe it is but not by long shot is it on par with the dark knight no and it will never be even close the story sucks also not only the miserable cast have to say that it is one of the worst movies have seen in the past years it truly just sucked no actual drama terrible scenes that you just want to end but never do if was not with other people we would have left halfway through patinson should never play batman maybe robin at most but he is no batman in any way if you wish to see good movie pick another and avoid this one wish hadn wasted hours of my liffe into this torment but here we are1.0\tthe batman even though it maybe flawed was one of the greatest most cinematic experience in the theater must watch if you are fan of the comic book genre1.0\tmatt reeves batman is an excellent example of how to bring comic book to life even though watched the movie just yesterday it instantly became one of my favorite films where can begin when there are so many wonderful things to say about this film well michael giacchino soundtrack is one of the best ve ever heard and the way it employed in the film absolutely elevates everything that being viewed robert pattinson as bruce wayne batman with zoë kravitz as selina kyle paul dano as the riddler jeffery wright as commissioner gordon and colin farrell as the penguin rounding out the supporting ensemble every single performer gives their game for this film giving it lived in vibe that adds to the grit it has an eerie and melancholy quality to it the batman is arguably as impressive as christopher nolan the dark knight and definitely lives up to the hype0.0\tdo not go and watch this terrible movie most elements of good batman movie are missing quirky dialogue cool gadgets assertive alfred and batman who can act watched for love of batman and good reviews here was sheer waste of time also is shot so dark that in most scenes nothing is visible1.0\tthe batman directed by matt reeves is an extremely interesting and refreshing take on the comic book hero the film showcases darker world than previously seen in batman films the horror element does not hurt the film it sets the mood of the setting the cinematography is the real star of the movie the visuals are great and accompanied by great soundtrack as well the action shots mixed with the music create an extremely fun and intriguing movie by the end of the movie the possibility of sequel seems likely this works well for all parties if you enjoy the movie you can be optimistic about future films robert pattinson plays batman and bruce wayne he took the role over from ben affleck the issues many fans had with affleck batman do not seem to be present with robert pattinson interpretation if you are fan of the batman franchise doubt you will be disappointed the movie will be available free on hbo max april 18 the one issue had with this film was simply the runtime standing at around three hours the movie is certainly long watch there are many side plots that take long time to conclude this is not always bad thing however felt that some points of the movie felt like they were dragging on overall though thoroughly enjoyed the movie1.0\tthe batman 2022 don usually review too many comic book movies but like to say thank you matt reeves for making us memorable batman movie came in to the movie expecting myself just to like it but absolutely loved it from the beginning to the end it had the right amount of intensity mystery action michael giacchino score got stuck in my head leaving the theatre as sang the melodies to my friends while taking pictures the music for me played big role in getting me focused into every scene with what was going on the cinematographyy blew me away and thinking how awesome it will be on 4k already excited to get it and see it again not big fan of three hour movies this is one of the few movies that made me feel like it wasn even almost three hours long the thing is not big fan of the cast but they were amazing robert pattinson least favorite fan and very much enjoyed him as the batman the penguin played by colin farrel stole the show for me unrecognisable with such good new york italian american accent that absolutely love the subtle comedy he brought to one specific scene my favorite scene am blown away by the entertainment thus movie gave me unexpectedly michelle pfeiffer will always be my number catwoman so far but zoe kravitz is going places with her acting she is defiantly becoming favorite of mine her portrayal of catwoman for me was better than anne hathaway in my opinion the riddler was nothing like the originals so it refreshing but love my old school riddler however it doesn take away the glory of the success of this movie for me phenomenal most definitely one of the best movies of 2022 by far0.0\tthis movie isn worth its runtime of hours 56 minutes with plot that ends in tatters the story is riddle based treasure hunt for the rat which translates to the batman with all his intelligence resources and super hero powers dancing to the tune of psychopath even after he done solving the riddles and the long emotional ride that we are taken for the audience is deprived of climax which can offer any semblance of moral victory you are repeatedly made to feel the evil side is doing the right thing batman looks lost clueless and you are left wondering why he even the batman the cinematography is too close angled for an action movie and good time is spent showing random colors and shapes which seem more like modern art painting illusion than shot from an action movie it jarring the entries of the batman the cat woman bat mobile try very hard to be dramatic but the audience is left wanting more the awestruck element is lacking the actors try their best however the story and the plot is left wanting and they can only do so much the chemistry between robert pattison and zoe is missing and you are left wondering why are they even kissing overall it miss dc heroes need complete refresh enough milking the cash cows they need to respect our time1.0\trobert pattinson is believable as batman not so much as bruce wayne not sure if it was his acting or the writing directing but he came across more as delinquent drug addict than billionaire member of society zoe kravitz is alluring in everything and so fun to watch what kept my eyes open for the almost three hours though was the brilliant performance of paul dano as the riddler the creepiness was oozing out of him even before he unmasked also dedicated few hours trying to see colin farrell through the prosthetics that turned him into delightfully entertaining penguin kudos to the casting director for buffering pattinson with excellent actors1.0\tbatman is movie that makes me feel confused because it is good movie generally but not as great as batman trilogy let put aside comparisons with the other batman movies for now first of all matt reeves realistic approach to the movie is very suitable because we have seen the same approach from nolan after that all superhero movies changed it is very wise to use nolan approach again know reeves from the apes series and like very much the atmosphere of the series but the pace issues were very obvious in that series had same doubts before went to the batman movie because the movies screen time is nearly hours in the end can say that didn get bored apart from few scenes in the second half of the movie so pacing is not big issue in the batman movie when it comes to the performances robert pattinson gave good performance as batman but he was not so convincing as bruce wayne briefly he is good choice for the role want to tribute paul dano because he gave one of the best performances as riddler and his role is very important for the whole movie he has clear motivations to challenge our hero and dano characterization of riddler as serious psycho also is very convincing zoe kravitz catwoman is also very convincing because we can learn her motivations clearly but didn like some addings to her background story catwoman relationship with batman and the the other characters make sense however anne hattaway is still my favorite catwoman must say that kravitz catwoman is more closer to comics as far as checked and this movie in way an origin story to catwoman however didn like some parts of it still it is one of the best decisions made by the director jeffrey wright is good as gordon but don even compare it to gary oldman gordon colin farrel is very good and convincing as penguin but his screen time is very little in this movie in the sequel want to see him more probably didn find convincing john turturo as carmine falcone his performance is mediocre maybe his performance is not good enough because of the screenplay am not sure but he doesn seem powerful crime boss at all my biggest disappointment is alfred because know andy serkis is great actor but we can barely see him in the movie think reeves must give andy serkis more space and lines to shine in the next movie probably briefly batman is good movie however it is nearly 3hrs it doesn bore you mostly it explains how batman shapes his morals in his early years its realistic dark tone is very suitable for the movies story although many positive points some characters like alfred should be handled better and screen time could have been decreased around 15 minutes to accelerate pacing little bit more the characterization of bruce wayne is not so much convincing this movie is nowhere near nolan movies so don even try to compare it any movie in the trilogy it worth seeing the movie at the cinema after the ending don wait too much for the post credits because it doesn worth it1.0\tfantastic reboot great storyline it is fierce and gloves off yes it has similarities to seven in good way the tech and the gadgets is turned down the bruce wayne character is changed and somehow more miserable than ever acting is good and on the top of this delicious treat some of the best cinematic action sequences have seen in long time think many of us craved this feeling during the pandemic so my question is now does nolan indisputably masterful triology seem bit outdated and polished now kind of think0.0\tugh it was like year old telling your his dream about batman hours of boring over wordy conversations random subplots and characters and lame action scenes cheated with dark lighting ooooof gotta go home and watch john wick to get rid of the rage0.0\tfor hour long film doesn feel like there was much in it should ve left an hour in like wanted too my mistake not sure if it was bad acting or bad script or both probably say the latter such shame as had real promise but doesn hold much hope for the following films1.0\tdirector matt reeves set out with star studded cast to bring fresh but familiar take on the batman mythos to the big screen with style and wit and stuck the landing every frame could fit in comic book the performances are passionate and brought to life with slow burn neo noir twist the batman is an amalgam of chinatown se7en saw and the dark knight early adventures in year one and zero year the film justifies it hour run time taking the audience on shadow odyssey through crime corruption justice and black revenge1.0\trate it as standalone movie it was good it was long but almost every scene had its relevance and if there weren previous iterations to compare this version to it can be considered very good movie pattinson filled the mask well he isn as buff as bale and affleck were but with the suit it didn really matter my issue was with his bruce wayne persona bruce wayne was always portrayed as an indifferent and irresponsible playboy billionaire and for good reason which wasn the case here his broody depiction didn really take issue with his looks as wayne didn take in my opinion thankfully pattinson was in costume for most of the film alfred was merely sidenote here and there wasn lot of chemistry between the two pity because alfred character is bedrock voice of reason father figure to bruce hopefully there more development on that front in the next instalments while paul dano performance was good couldn shake the feeling that he was merely channeling heath ledger joker someone mentioned the movie se7en they were spot on colin farrell penguin reminded me of robert de niro al capone in the untouchables even looked like him zoe kravitz held her own as catwoman though her mask if you can call it that was accidentally funny jeffrey wright and john torturro both reliable actors didn disappoint in gotham gloom and doom was captured perfectly cinematography was amazing as was the soundtrack although parts sounded like the imperial march chris nolan set the standard for dark superhero movies but at least he knew when to inject humour humour was totally absent in this take that said it wasn necessarily bad thing as the movie pacing didnt really require it still lighter moments couldn have hurt the movie either can recall single wow moment could it have been better absolutely nevertheless it worked as detective noir not sure if will watch it again but do recommend viewing0.0\ttbh all in for batman these reviews read were so good but fortunately this movie is very hyped this movie can easily be hours long but it like they directed it in slow motion was trying hard not to fall asleep not much action as expected maybe nothing can beat christian bale no offence this batman wasn bad but if only they gave him more action and combat scenes rather than riddles for batman fan do watch it but don expect too much it very slow film1.0\tlike the fact that the whole film was shot in pure dark and the cinematography was just too perfect acting was solid the soundtrack by michael giacchino is just would say that the film is just perfect in every way the riddler was just phenomenal matt reeve work makes the film 10 times better zoë kravitz just stole the show she is the perfect catwoman have seen have seen the film for like times and still like it to see it1.0\tthis movie is solid 10 for me you really get sucked into the world of gotham and batman not much action but focused on detective work really enjoyed the new version of batman it isn perfect batman but it definitely batman we need to see down for more movies trilogy if possible robert did an amazing job1.0\tviolent dark and story to hear cast were superb too really impressed with this version of batman spot on all you need now is director cut for an option to include more blood and will spice this movie up even more1.0\tthe film was brilliant would ve given it 10 10 but there were few pacing issues but towards the latter half of the film it picked up and made up for the pacing issues mentioned robert pattinson and zoe kravitz were outstanding the cinematography of the film was amazing this is easily one of the best films in the batman series alongside the dark knight with heath ledger of course if you had your doubts about the film do not hesitate it was brilliant1.0\tgritty entertaining best batman movie since the dark knight over time might be better bit slow at times but not boring pattison makes an incredible caped crusader zoe is unreal as catwoman paul dano is an out of this world riddler very violent for pg 13 movie the ending was awesome it full hours so you ve been warned but you really couldn cut anything out of the film it needed to be that long0.0\tthe lead is good as batman in fact all the casting choices are good the aesthetic is interesting and even the relentless dim darkness with little contrast works fairly well but at some point it starts to collapse on itself and by the end was bored and frustrated and while the nods to se7en and saw were better than the joker movie rampant plagiarism of its particular genre at the end this batman film lacks the touch and soul that made the first burton and second nolan movies work so well really tried to like this one but it ultimately hollow experience that borrows more than it gives1.0\tabsolutely incredible the writing the acting the cinematography the story everything 10 was invested the whole time and can not wait to see it again hats off to matt reeves and the cast for making this happen1.0\tit cracker no doubt about it matt reeves did great job with 2022 the batman it difficult not to compare this to other batman films though that dc warner bros fault for featuring him so much in recent times ll get this out the way early say batman begins the dark knight are superior not by much which is similar case for the character performances too robert pattinson is terrific bruce wayne though christian bale still edges him out in my eyes zoë kravitz is probably the best catwoman ve seen though the rest from the riddler to penguin to alfred have been portrayed better aside from commissioner gordon with jeffrey wright being excellent paul dano is the least enjoyable performer for me here found his showing to be bit meh effective but meh barry keoghan makes cameo won say as who but don hold high hopes for him in that role though apparently it won be anything that happens anyway for the best anyway the above sounds way too negative as did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film hence the very positive rating the pacing is very good the cinematography is brilliant gotham looks fantastically bleak the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point the scenes with pattinson kravitz and pattinson wright are my favourite moments it film that consider as outstanding it ll be cool to see what reeves does with this trilogy should it happen of course0.0\thad no expectations for this and glad didn slow moving little action the saving grace of the movie was farrell as penguin of all the batman films this has to be bottom for me1.0\tafter first viewing find this batman movie still notch behind nolan movie has some great strenghts as atmosphere in form of neo noire cinematography story build up still find riddler to be little bit dissapointing after his iditentity reveal but prior to that his whole scheme was satistfiying robbert pattison in role of batman bruce was good especially as the younger inexperienced version that has not matured yet but still it looks awkward in certain moments penguin was as an extra dot to the story was simply that and cat woman tied in nicely as side kick character overall good experience 101.0\tgreat batman movie wow this cast this music the story man ngl got lost in translation with some of the dialogue but really love what matt reeves did here robert pattinson was great choice for batman and always knew he had the potential zoe kravitz was such good selina kyle her chemistry with robert pattinson was chefs kiss in love with this movie and it prolly my favourite batman movie1.0\tit is the best batman movie since the dark knight the only problem is it has too many villains all the cast did great job in acting specially robert pattinson the ending was epic this movie won complete the greatness without part two0.0\tpompous overlong and overrated batman movie not in the same league as the nolan or tim burton movies the batman is what you get when black humor is completely absent and the director takes everything way to serious1.0\trobert pattinson confidently steps into the boots of the caped crusader young and brutal justice seeker within the crime riddled cesspit he knows as home here we see him as the world greatest detective as envisioned in the comics using his technology and intelligence to analyse crime scenes and decipher clues his adversary the riddler the most sinister interpretation of the villain to ever grace our screens serial killer with mysterious agenda and penchant for puzzles paul dano injects plenty of personality into this smart and elusive foe and proves worthy opponent for batman as he tries to uncover his master plan the tone is dark to match the film colour palette which is fitting for batman story of this scope and ambition ensnaring us into the fabric of gotham grimy aesthetic and making us feel just as helpless as our hero and his allies once the riddler begins his reign of torment overall there lots to admire in matt reeves striking film the cinematography the voice over narration the action scenes the music everything plays an integral part and feels fantastic placing us firmly within this nightmarish fictional expansion of our world and the corruption that inhabits it it exciting it gripping and it been well worth the wait 101.0\tloved it from the beginning to the end don compare it to the past movies this is great movie robert pattinson is definitely the batman being on the sequel0.0\toverated cringey socially awkward batman almost parody uni project compared to the dark knight trilogy the hype train rating it so highly are mentally unstable clearly once the hype dies down the truth will come to light netflix movie at best1.0\tsystematically this film is well made starting through very quick intro about our batman because believe we already know who batman is then meet the problem try to solve his problems and personal history then meet the girl then try to solve the mysterious enemy together fight and save the city in my personal pov the film lacks emotion for the story and the characters don know for sure but it seems too shallow which is ironic because the film is so long it still worth watching if wandering about the batman reboot how it synchronizes with the dc extended universe dceu and how the acting of robert pattinson the famous twilight movie star and zoë kravitz the daughter of famous celebrity in addition the movie ambiance is really well made through dark theme cold tone and ofc the cinematography is magnificent tbh not film expert just moviegoer and cinephile didn watch the trailer and didn try to find any info about this film to prevent my personal expectations overall am neither disappointed nor dissatisfied1.0\tdefinitely one of the best batman films with some of the best characters robert pattinson was great batman but in my opinion not the best bruce wayne however we only see him like times think seeing bruce wayne so little hindered the effect of batman but nevertheless loved watching it slow burner but worthwhile and definitely could ve been shorter all of the villains penguin falcone and the riddler where all really well developed zoe kravitz was also great as cat woman definitely detective batman film not your average continuous action batman but also one to watch1.0\tthis movie gave me hope that cinema is still alive while we ve seen so many iterations of superhero movies that we all love but have to admit that this movie is very different from any superhero movie this movie is masterpiece they don do movies like this anymore this movie made me think of chinatown seven and the godfather movies that made me in love with cinema and seeing my favorite character which is the batman in very detective movie made me fall in love with movies again the last time was this happy after leaving the theater was watching the dark knight and that was long time ago1.0\twhen someone says that this batman movie is dark gritty and real it feels almost comical haven we done that before not that long ago the answer is yes and no this batman story still has nolan fingerprints all over it but also finds its own way in some ways it feels closer to se7en or zodiac than superhero movie this batman flits in and out of crime scenes assembling clues and piecing things together as the world falls apart around him much like in the 90s comics almost every single choice works gotham feels bigger and darker than ever like something out of the arkham video games the cinematography feels like classic action comic blended with noir movie the characters moodiness feels pretty fair it is slow brooding mystery that takes its time sometimes too much time but that almost always paid off reeves managed batman that feels deeply rooted in everything before it but also finally gets some things right that have been missing from every other adaptation every once in while if you squint your eyes enough you forget it is superhero movie altogether0.0\tdark cineha hall depressing and dark movie with almost all scenes shot in just darkness just the last one scene may be at dusk weak plot poor character development for bad guy with his silly mask tbh the batman series of christian bale was fantastic this is just lost the steam1.0\tsomeone ounce saw figure out in the forest which yielded pillowcase full of supplies out of mystery it was necessary for this someone to get fairly close to the forest walker and get good look see where its eyes would wander trap was set an apple next to fire at night so this thing walks on the scene staring at the sky straight up it sees the trapper slowly stand while gripping handel bars the trapper says im working on my handel bars do you know how to do that creature no also have an engine says the trapper and this person points to an engine on the floor next to healthy stream with passing by fish in straight line suddenly both of them say at the same time oopse ive gatta go check the files ive got work to do1.0\tgreat movie with suberb story strong acting immersive music intense action must watch batman movie grounded to reality suberb take on the caped crusader0.0\twanted to love this so much but seriously do not try and reboot unless you are going to bring something new to the table all the actors were actually great but it shame it was tarnished with such an absolutely boring pointless script complete waste of hours of my life that ll never get back1.0\tthis is masterclass filmmaking top tier in all aspects from the cinematography to the effects and the respect and passion for the source material this is what happens when you give director years to make movie instead of year matt reeves had the oportunity to really take his time with this film and create something special and he did everthing superhero movie or just movie in general should strive to be absolutely everthing could ve asked for1.0\tthe director of this film did really good job of making this movie and the actors were amazing in this movie and of course good cast and most of all damn brutal0.0\tturturro and farrell were good everything else was very disappointing from the beginning to the last scene poor script poor dialogues tedious action scenes twisted plot stretched filming should be less than2hrs music was like humming for the best part won mention details to keep it spoiler free watch and go movie nothing worth to remember or talk about or re watch batman prestige was really ruined as you couldn find the batman nowhere1.0\tforget the nolan films and enjoy this brilliant brand new vision pattinson nails it as batman very much detective film also loved that this film had so much batman on screen throughout1.0\twow what movie it is this is totally masterpiece hats off to matt reeves and wow robert pattinson perfect batman really really liked the movie the movie is so dark throughout the runtime1.0\tit too long that is clear but something happens in every scene you can take your eyes off the action and you don feel like it three hours but it dark and by this mean the severe lack of lighting even when it day time not often it raining robert pattinson is just doing christian bale impersonation through the whole film and you leave knowing it just the first film in series watch it but take cushion1.0\taction cinematography acting music batman bruce wayne catwoman commissioner gordon villians side characters origin story ending better overall excited for the sequel1.0\tll like to start out this review with tour through wayne dark mansion stepping in you ll wonder if it owned by barnabas collins of dark shadows dracula or the adams family but since you know that you re watching the batman you know it owned by bruce wayne and yet matt reeves has made the best wayne mansion yet dark decor of delight like opening up bundle of dark chocolates fashioning to the true inward character of bruce wayne love for darkness an emo dream mansion and not to mention robert pattinson take on the dark knight is maybe the best take on bruce wayne yet bruce wayne throughout this film is tormented by his parents death with blood for vengeance robert pattinson portrays the most brutal batman yet with skull crushing punches and mortal combat styled fighting truly the darkest knight yet like bat from hell and gotham well this has to be the best portrayal of gotham next to batman forever directed by joel schumacher as for villains the penguin played by collin farrell is like al capone from untouchables played by robert de niro the utter grin the scar the mafia club owner look of oswald cobblepot is perfect truly collin farrel take on the penguin is the best villain in this film now don get me wrong paul dano as riddler is oddly entertaining but oftentimes is quite cringe to watch like watching young bill gates portray the riddler but paul dano is perfect choice for the role the riddler is supposed to be cringe annoying odd just look at the scene when he is locked up in boxed room obnoxiously laughing even you had to cringe at that moment well just look at jim carrey take on the riddler oftentimes weird and obnoxious but jim as an obnoxious character is just fun to watch and hilarious jim take still is the best of the riddler and one of the best performances ever in batman films then there is catwoman played by joë kravitz she plays this role really well but not as great as michelle pfeiffer in batman returns overall this film is crime detective gothic classic the dark knight aka vengeance goes on hunt with detective gordon played by jefferey wright which is very likeable gordon they both in this film hunt for the clues left behind by riddler and on the way fight crime and bust crime while solving the puzzles matt reeves cleverly has come up with masterful classic but not masterpiece but matt reeves has created perhaps the best bruce wayne yet in robert pattinson and one of the best narrated batman films ever ok robert pattinson doesn play heroic batman like micheal keaton batman he doesn play playboy like christian bale bruce wayne he doesn play soft hearted kind loving bruce wayne like george clooney but robert pattinson plays what you would expect from man that lost his parents as child robert pattinson take on batman is billionaire recluse taking revenge on his parents death his connection to the dark knight with his recluse style of bruce wayne makes perfect sense his love for darkness black goth bats everything between bruce and batman equally yoked together becoming one equally sharing as the best portrayal of bruce wayne and the best batman narration since batman begins the batman is masterful gothic classic give it 84 1001.0\tll start off by saying this is the best batman movie ve ever seen though understand that the dark knight is still exceptional due to the performance of heath ledgers joker the batman is just as exceptional due to robert pattinsons batman people will say its too dark gloomy but this is what batman gotham is matt reeves has given us the perfect batman and no one can deny that sold 10 10 and will be going to the cinema again to watch it at least once more1.0\tthe batman was great movie one of the best ones ve seen in longtime the atmosphere of gotham was amazing robert patterson was amazing as batman bruce wayne zoe kravitz as catwoman was also amazing serkis as alfred was amazing colin farrel also had amazing performance the mvp of the film was paul dano as the riddler he had oscar worthy performance and we should be seeing him winning oscar in 2023 and it leaves me wanting more from this universe overall amazing movie definitely suggest seeing it1.0\tspeechless with this amazing film the script 10 cinematography 10 10 acting 10 realism 10 10 costume designs 10 action scenes 10 10 for anyone who is big batman fan believe me this film will not disappoint on any level we need more great films like this one and excited for sequel1.0\tfor batman fans others might say that this is long or there is no huge galaxy saving issue at site but we see you batman in this we see you change he is going through doubts he is going through and working with them was not sure about the cast but let me tell you this everyone pulled the heavy weight and then some as am getting old was losing that inspiration he gave me when was kid got some of it today and urge you to watch it stay inspired fight for what is yours your dreams1.0\tdon base your assumptions of this film on twilight probably like everyone was skeptical of patz becoming the bat but take it all back he was absolutely outstanding was also mildly irritated by dc churning out yet another version of the character but again take it back this is one amazing ensemble of movie every actor was absolutely brilliant really enriching their roles dano riddler makes jim carrey look like punch and judy character john turturro was really terrifying and he didn really even do anything it lengthy film yes but didn feel it was overlong my favourite moment was when the batmobile appeared this was shining example of the incredible sound design of the movie can wait to see it again above all as scot was thrilled to recognise parts of glasgow in the scenes1.0\tinteresting perspective of the batman more close to the detective side and more grounded to reality don think it the best movie of the batman series but enjoyed it1.0\twhen they first announced that pattinson was playing bruce wayne batman was like give me break take my words back he did great job great casting really enjoyed this crime thriller this was batman being the best detective sorry bale but think found my new favorite batman can wait for more1.0\tgenuinely great movie one of the better dc movies ve seen come out in while the whole cast was amazing the story was incredible the soundtrack and score was phenomenal major props to the cast and crew the twists and suspense really kept this film going the chemistry between zoë and robert was amazing that little peek at another fan favourite villain there toward the end was unexpected this actually felt like batman movie can wait to see what they do next with this iteration of the story1.0\tto be honest my standard were very low because of all of the superhero movies that have come out of dc ass in recent years but this one really surprised the batman is very entertaining there is never slow moment whenever it starts to dip down to almost being slow picks right back up again was always moving in my seat whenever the acton happen robert pattinson does really fantastic job at nailing batman and also making his own bruce wayne the best way can describe it is if you grab batman arkham city batman arkham origins and batman arkham knight and you smash them together you will get this movie highly recommended definitely worth the watch0.0\tdon know about you guys but right now we don need movie that leaves you meserable and bad after watching movie this is way worse than the nolan batman movies and the leadactors are joke as well in this movie the world is burning but we re not given much reason to care rent it1.0\tit batman movie with david fincher vibe although the plot and storytelling are not as intense as had hoped but they are still intriguing my minor letdown was most likely the final act the film came close to not being able to come to good conclusion nonetheless this is the ultimate cinematic experience if there is to be sequel this is great starting point1.0\treally don know why it didn land well with me but still liked lot of things about the batman first of all gotham city this is how it supposed to look dark gothic full of thugs it even remainderd me arkham games when it comes to atmosphere that probably my problem like batman and his great rogue gallery but this was too grounded and realistic to actually let such individuals exist that why main villain was bit underwhelming at least to me know movie was inspired by seven and it quite visible also bit too many subplots it weird to say this but with runtime around three hours there are few things that felt rushed overall great atmosphere and am sure many many people will love this movie am just not sure how feel about it1.0\tthis film is just about better than the dark knight rises in most aspects think anyone could ve played this batman honestly lets be real the batman character requires you to just look stoic gain bit of muscle train and fit in the bat suit bruce wayne requires you to look sharp and rich simple the zodiak killer riddler was awesome the best part was falling asleep at one point but at that moment realized the movie was too good to sleep on felt like was thrown into this gotham world not really built up but it was still fun left around the hours and 43 minutes mark think everyone was waiting for sweet taste of some sort of joker reference deep down inside it maybe better than tdkr but don think anything can touch the haunting beautiful film the dark knight1.0\tdifferent film from the classic superhero movies it shows the city as total chaos that is impossible to control the psychological conflict that bruce goes through throughout the film shows more human side of batman and shows how this affected him at the beginning of his life as superhero1.0\tthe batman is in many ways the film the dark knight should have been as it is the first film since batman begins that focuses primarily on the development of the main character of bruce wayne though you may have seen films with similarities you do not know how this film will end 90 of the footage used in trailers is in the first 15 minutes of the film and the tension only builds from there most of the actors make the roles their own though some events in the film do not feel earnest based solely on the media presented and rely on history outside the film though was rooting for him before he was confirmed to be cast rob bat bat in son can be intimidating and engrossing some of his line delivery fell flat to me though this may have been side effect of filming while recovering from covid the script is solid for the most part with the occasional bit of clunky dialogue but overall it is tight plot with multiple twists and the occasional easter eggs for the attuned viewer matt reeves direction the sound design dp and set design were all at the top of their games but they couldn hold candle to michael giacchino phenomenonal score strongly recommend seeing this film if you are 10 or above think young children may get bored by the length not follow the plot or frightened by some of the scenes1.0\tdark memorizing and shocking at times the batman proves hollywood has not lost it edge with the cape crusader this new edgy film noir is thrilling artistic take of batman that whould make any fan of vengeance wanting more from this new universe0.0\thorrible waste of time want refund and my hours back most of the people in the theater were so bored people were getting off leaving playing on their phones due to boredom sound track was awesome1.0\tloved how matt reeves made the origin story of batman unique by making it story about robert pattison learning to accept the bruce wayne side of his persona rather than just the batman side although it may be hard getting used to seeing such bruiting take on batman and although the movie may have its minor flaws the overall character arch leaves you wanting more as we are teased the bruce wayne we have come to love from previous installments1.0\tthe batman story is exactly what you want from 10 10 batman movie it dark and full of action even scary at some parts robert pattison portrayed everything perfectly giving an amazing performance of the batman none other than bruce wayne love that this is universe on it own where batman is dark character as he is supposed to be this batman movie is must watch1.0\tthis is with no doubt one of the best batman adaptations ever made was lucky to watch it on the pre release and that was also one of the first times went to cinema after the pandemic that was amazing unique experience matt reeves was able to not only create and adapt super hero or character but feeling something that coming and can be controlled the acting of both robert pattinson and paul dano is incredible to watch and the movie can pass to you all the action the anxiety and the intensity of it all in the smoothest way possible the flow of the story and the path matt decides to let batman go into is incomparable the movie will give you all the chaos you want to see in bartman movie it will show you imperfect batman complex personalities and amazing mazes1.0\tone of the best batman movies masterpiece from matt reeves and robert pattinson the camera work is amazing the work of the entire film team is gorgeous have never had such pleasure from film there would be more such films from dc1.0\tfrom the performances cinematography score and direction the batman has lot to offer the derivative story beats and runtime could use some adjustment nevertheless minor flaws and all the batman is supposedly of new franchise and universe and can wait to see what next1.0\tan exceptional version of superhero film the batman raises the bar and sets new standard rooted in the tonal realism and grit of the more recent dc universe this reeves rendition transcends the genre and breaks new ground by exploring neo noir perspective fresh character introspection societal and political commentary while utilising every bit of the structure to not waste minute of this hour film to tie every element together to create this masterpiece while this film purposefully chooses to omit the element of comedy it doesn lose any of the fun in the process1.0\twhere to begin this is like watching dark knight in more epic city with more darkness with more epic villains except heath leadger joker of course with best batman ever the second one is far away like they took all the godly staff from dark night and put them in arkham game style moviee even weak rookie batman with year equipment an weak batmobile look godlike because of the cinematography and direction it like how the directors make thomas shelby look epic in peaky blinders it the same thing the soundtrack oooh myy this movie is above ten easily no flaws just pure art this masterpiece just joined my top of all time the others are interstellar inception dark night and braveheart give this movie damn heath leadger joker and surpass the nolan trilogy easily1.0\tthese are two different types of movies even though they are about the same character this movie is cool of course it is batman batman is always cool this definitely has the best fight scenes in batman movie even though found the movie just tad bit too dark at times to see what was happening batman is cool for the most part but he shows zero emotion and is basically mumbling or whispering like he is out of breath the whole time even bruce wayne talks the same way which doesn give him this duel personality he is just extremely emo this isn the playboy bruce wayne we are used to this dude is moody as hell the length didn bother me but think the story is little weak the riddler is cool but isn as menacing as someone like bane or ras penguin did good job and that chase scene was epic there are few exposition scenes which wasn terrible but it could had been done better like how one character tells bruce wayne how his father saved him and this and that lastly think the big final action set piece was little disappointing batman just fights bunch of faceless goons the best action set piece is the car chase and maybe the short but sweet club fight overall it is good movie waiting to see it on hd blu ray in better quality to really appreciate the fights 101.0\twas dubious about yet another batman movie as we ve had plenty to satisfy us over the last 30 years happy to be proved wrong feels like film nior style with more emphasis on the detective side of the character and the psychology of the riddler if you ve played the darker video games you ll probably like this1.0\tthis movie is kind of difficult to evaluate as it presents some novel variations on traditional batman elements and characters overall it seems to work here are my observations about it batman portrayal is decent but bruce wayne little odd as other reviewers have said emo batman is indestructible he can hang glide off building smash into cars and other solid items bounce off the pavement few times then walk away and everything fine bullets don bother him much either batman punches lot of people if that your cup of tea you won be disappointed it always dark in gotham even during the day and it always raining new and unusual interpretations of riddler and penguin catwoman is still in developmental stage and not known by that name although she does identify with cats the relationship between her and batman is appealing and you want to see more of it story is convoluted complicated don want to have to work that hard to follow comic book movie but even though it is very long at almost three hours it manages to hold your attention there were only couple moments where said to myself can we get on with this now and yes it is very grim with not much to lighten the mood in spite of that it doesn come across as being heavyhanded if you like batman and are not wedded to prior depictions like the dark knight or the michael keaton series most of which sucked anyway you ll like this take on the caped crusader1.0\tbest cbm human ever made we could not be more thankful for matt reeves can believe what did we just saw the batman will forever be in cinema fans minds1.0\tjust got out of the cinema imax and was like god damn what did just watch this movie is so much better than expected robert pattinson and paul aka the riddler was fascinating and jeffrey wright zoë kravitz acting was great loved every second of the action liked the added mystery detective type of story compared to other batman films this makes more darker themed batman hours run time is totally worth it the dirty criminality and madness in gotham city you will feel it it so dark which batman character needs this damn beautiful movie is so comic accurate just fall in love with it know robert pattinson is in my personal opinion is the best batman the batman will go down as one of the best comic book films in long time the script performances set pieces visual storytelling was phenomenal robert pattinson shines as an emotional brooding batman next to paul dano terrifying riddler matt reeves modern masterpiece out 101.0\thave been beyond excited for this movie ever since it was announce and must admit this movie definitely does not disappoint hour epic with stellar cast and performances that has you gripped for the entire runtime with standout performances from colin farrell paul dano and of course robert pattinson who shines as the caped crusader in what in my opinion after multiple viewings is the most stellar batman performance on the big screen wont get into the story much since people should discover it for themselves but have to say it was gripping story that had us hooked for the entire almost hour runtime also finally we have standalone batman movie with epic action set pieces all around with gripping and interesting detective noir storyline which never includes dull moment overall must say this is must see movie for any batman fan out there and if you can go out to see it in the cinema you will be rewarded with stellar cinematic experience if you do so highly recommended movie which is most certainly worth buying on blu ray it is 10 10 movie which could go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time1.0\tthis was batman like we have never seen simply stunning performance from all it was truly cinematic masterpiece matt reeves and robert pattinson bring justice back to the character paul dano was born to play the riddler zoe kravitz was made for catwoman0.0\twas so hyped for this movie but turns out to be my biggest disappointment of this year if this is the new batman will happily have ben affleck back well am thankful that he is returning this december so maybe thats where my batman thirst can be quenched1.0\tthis is very unique take on batman that hasn been done on film before you can feel the influence films like se7en and real life true crime has had on the director vision overall this is very dark personal tale that makes the characters of the batman and bruce wayne the central focus versus secondary to the villains like past renditions it long film but the plot itself is very interesting and covers lot of territory thematically while ultimately having the skeleton of crime murder mystery every character was portrayed wonderfully including batman catwoman alfred gordon riddler and penguin all the actors came to play and it really shows that said the majority of the character development appropriately went to batman while other films have skimmed the surface of his duality and inner turmoil this one really elevates it to an interesting level and hat is off to pattinson who killed it here we have young batman who is still incredibly tormented by his parents deaths so he hurting and angry and still hasn really figured out what he stands for or what his goal is it so interesting to watch him start to figure that out the action is awesome this is another portrayal of more realistic batman and the villains and the realism means the violence and action really hit hard batman fight scenes and the car chase scene were super intense and fun to watch for pg 13 movie this definitely pushed the boundaries overall the filmmakers really stretched this film to be marketable enough for the masses while making if you can believe it darker but more personal portrayal of our hero it hard to say where this lines up in the roster of batman films but will say that never thought there be contender for the best film after the dark knight until now right now think they re too different to compare so think your favorite batman movie is personal decision that said this might be mine time will tell whether that holds up either way all in for more stories of this batman1.0\tas batman fan guess im hard to please how people loved nolans the dark knight movies still dont understand thought this movie looked bad casted bad sounded bad but its not its gritty and worthy its not trying to be justice league in scope its tale of gotham pleasantly surprised1.0\tthis is what batman movie should be dark and gritty this is the batman always wanted the one have been reading in the comics the one on the animated show movies this is the batman that portraits the greatest detective title love this want more1.0\tyoung brooding batman tracking down calculative menacing riddler in neo noir corrupted gotham with dark secrets intriguingly inspird by long halloween matt reeves delivered superb batman movie that was rooting for years even to some extent he went beyond than that ll love to see more of his take on bat verse in coming years1.0\tthrow all your other batman blurays in the trash when this comes out buy it it the best rendition of the character yet dark gritty bleak just how batman should be enough said1.0\tdon listen to the naysayers who can get over the glittery vampire playing batman robert pattinson has always been force to be reckoned with and he did this character justice in ways bale couldn fathom the entire cast was stellar but when you can spot an speck of colin farrell you realize the makeup crew deserve mad props too this is the batman ve been waiting for and can wait to see what else they bring to table1.0\tgod this movie is just what dc fans needed will be seeing it again many more times robert is batman and an amazing one at that matt is director of talent and perfection0.0\tthe batman by matt reeves is utter guano bringing nothing new to the comic movie table it both derrivitive and boring possessing nothing in the way of an interesting story characters or even villain would recommend you watch suicide squad again rather than this 45 101.0\tthe movie was decent if overly long my biggest gripe is batman always moving so damn slow he slow walks super slow from the shadows multiple times he slow walks through crime scenes dude even turns his head slow get it it for dramatic effect and to show how he an observant detective cool but we don need him to be like that every single minute coulda saved half an hour of run time if he just walked like normal human being also why don bad guys just shoot him in the face guys machine gunning batman in the chest when if they tipped their guns up smidge they take him out easy kinda dumb movie making oh well overall still fun watch though on the bottom tier of bat flicks1.0\twow that was great version of the batman world greatest detective dark enthralling and brutal see why it was given 15 age rating here in the uk well done matt reeves who directed in what think its the most comic accurate version of the batman made and robert pattison nailed it as young bruce wayne1.0\tlike so many other reviewers balked at the idea of glitter boy patterson being cast as the new batman especially after taking liking to afflecks go at the character but boy was wrong know keaton bale and affleck each bought different element to bats and they all were great but when seen patterson eyes in the mask it hit me that am seeing the closest thing to the comics on the big screen and was hooked loved every second of it the rest of the cast was great as well will definitely see it again and can wait for the sequel0.0\tomg worst batman film ever it should be pg all of the fight scenes bit of violence are cut out blurred too dark rp still sulky teenager felt like was watching very long boring game at fetish club every ones in some sort of outfit but nothings really happening characters lack charisma plot seems to be rip from the side plot of the playstation game at hours debated leaving but felt commited and sure something was going to happen then something did the credit roll at hours 56 this is just my opinion anyway1.0\tthese negative reviews are sad just enjoy the work that everyone put into this and you will enjoy this one of the best films ve seen if you like dark and gritty films expecting the past or comic book accurate version will just get in the way1.0\tlove this movie this is very grounded and intense just like the nolan trilogy matt reeves did and amazing job with this film and considering that covid was affecting everything and the fact that it still this good have huge praise for matt reeves the riddler was terrifying villain and his riddles were very fun and intriguing and the final act when it all comes to head what they did really surprised me and loved that the criminals are treated as terrorists again not comic book characters which was great and this is the best looking batman film ever everybody in the cast was amazing paul dano chews up the scenery every time he appears andy serkis collin farrell and john turturro were excellent to but jeffery wright zoe kravitz and robert pattinson stole the show they were all incredible in the film this film statisfied so much with how realistic it is with bruce trying to figure out what batman truly is how at odds the cops and batman were loved batmans partnership with gordon and selina the whole plot is great the film looks amazing the acting is on point and the action the best that have seen in any batman film and is my favourite batman film next to the dark knight it literally blew my mind and has mr clapping by the end can wait to see sequel and more from this bat universe go and watch it as soon as can it is 100 worth it1.0\tthe batman returns to the big screen darker than ever the shadow isn batmans greatest ally anymore he is the shadow batman isn the symbol of hope but the symbol of fear this film does not have to hide from nolans dark knight trilogy this is dark and epic batman detective story it captivates you from the first frame to the very last cinematography and visuals are peak cinema matt reeves along with the whole cast are amazing all in for robert pattinson batman trilogy1.0\tgenuine batman movie not superhero flick but true to self batman film that stays true to itself we are presented with much more grounded batman than what we saw in ben affleck portrayal and thus this batman is missing his more than human presence albeit pattinson batman does decent job at haunting the criminals of gotham as we expect batman to do the fight choreography whilst not being on the level of say the warehouse scene in batman super ultimate edition is still very good and without doubt worthy of praise the film is pg rating and the audience can definitely tell exactly how it achieved the low rating this isn damaging to the story however considering that this isn story that very young children are likely to enjoy more flexible rating may have benefited this movie overall the batman is an incredible crime thriller that sets in motion potentially incredible arc for the personification of vengeance the story and soundtrack are an absolute hit must watch for all batman and movie fans1.0\tthe batman was meticulously euphoric matt reeves not only lived up the hype but delivered one for the ages from the character arcs to the thrilling narrative and execution man run the show in fincher esque way shades of zodiac se7en and had enough fanboy moments robert pattinson did justice to that cape crusader he was wearing after early skeptics of his casting he did excellent all the way never doubted him paul dano the riddler was menacing act while collin ferrel as penguin steals the show every freaking time he showed up zoe kravitz the catwoman was superb perfect casting greig fraiser atmospheric visuals rich with dark themes and neon noir frames of gotham city was feast to watch giachino score was eccentric super pumped up for that batmobile chase scene this is probably the best dc movie ve seen since nolan the dark knight and will go down as one of the best comic book movies ever made hands down matt reeves1.0\tthis was beautiful movie experience that left me in awe the lighting and cinematography was gorgeous the tone was perfect which kept me engaged through this world greatest detective story the acting was superb paul dano was terrifying and is now one of the best comic book villains brought to the screen to me this is the best batman film as well as the best comic book movie of all time1.0\tit not very often when film impacts me the way this does this isn batman movie this is the batman movie the batman movie we ve been leading up to director after director have tried to make film as compelling as this one nolan got close but they felt like nolan films not batman films the batman is film will never forget experiencing in theaters for the first time even if think it little long it never feels like it dragging love this movie1.0\tfirst of all hats off to matt reeves this movie was fantastic rob absolutely knocked it out of the park as batman how much this version of the bat was hell bent on fixing seemingly unfixable gotham is so enticing this bruce takes getting used to but after the 3rd watch it growing on me and feel his character will evolve and we will get to see the phases of bruce that we haven before bruce wants to be batman it weird to even say bruce as 90 of the time it batman on screen and absolutely love that the action was great the entire movie was like cinematic edit start to end all of the side characters were brilliant the stand out sides for me were penguin and riddler they were genuinely all amazing but these two stuck out for me the only reason this isn 10 10 for me are my tiny tiny nit picks would have liked to have batmans cape allow him to fly that just something like more it didn feel too dragged and every scene felt right the cinematic shots were great think just few seconds too long some of them brilliant and if not my favourite portrayal of the bat bale has been my favourite but this batman is so different it hard to compare definitely the movie itself is up there with the dark knight the third watch has really made me lean to rob as my favourite portrayal of the batman he is the shadows was worried about rewatch ability but there is no worries will 100 see it fourth time times now and the movie holds up rob is my batman1.0\tthe gotham built for matt reeves the batman is breathtaking you ll simply want to pause and just take the cityscape in it brutal and violent in all the good ways so don expect the less is more approach to nolans daek knight trilogy oh this movie will definitely show you the music fits perfectly for this dark tale of the world greatest detective of whom that title is truly put to the test yes the runtime is tad too long yard some scenes drawn out the sheer beauty of the world will keep your eyes glued to the screen0.0\tjust because it is different from previous movies doesn mean that its great or genius the only pros can point out are cinematography of some shots taking advantage of the dark character and dc in general now to the cons catwoman role and casting seemed forced cringey and out of character won go into detail for this one the over streched runtime makes it feel like an unskippable cutscene from an arkham game people comparing this to se7en should rethink their take on crime genre this one lacks any purpose and is rather uninspiring predictable and delivers disappointment0.0\tif you like emo superheroes and hr long meandering plot line to mediocre story then you ll probably think it was pretty good start with pattinson plays edward cullen as the batman add some creepy weirdo vibes and severe depression makes for flat bruce wayne and one dimensional batman struggling fiercely to be real poured over the plot and story were okay but could ve been consolidated to two hours garnish don forget twist of critical race theory pros the moral of the story was awesome revenge destroys you as much as the other person forgiveness is the only way forward after suffering evil the bat mobile was awesome selena kyle was hot the action was decent paul dano performance was good but ve seen better work from him cons the villains none were believable the penguin could ve been great but under delivered falcone really yeah right the riddler get ready to facepalm is an incell give me break while role my eyes who wrote this the joker1.0\tmay have been one of the few who believed in robert pattinson since his announcement as the next one to wear the bat hood yet still felt certain fear but fortunately the result was much better than expected felt that all that sordid and dark atmosphere of gotham that liked so much in burton films was rescued the detective side of the character that is almost never explored so much in his adaptations became one of his biggest focuses even though at certain moments of the investigation process it didn hold me as much besides the action scenes and photography that are magnificent however one of its biggest problems is its third act that ends up being bit megalomaniacal and conclusion not so satisfactory although like the development of the protagonist throughout this plot and perhaps got little lost in the midst of so much darkness think it still early to establish robert as the best batman in cinema but yes he has everything to be1.0\tsome people say that it was boring and too long they do have lot of resons to say so like he isn perfect superhero he doesn have so much tech and also film is too long and some of the reasons are not considerable bcs they did use cam copies to review darkest universe movie but the very resons they do hate is my reason to give 10 stars to this movie bcs its make this movie perfect in dc darkest and the realistic way and also this movie depict that dont measure robot pattinsons acting talent toward the batman through the twilight saga1.0\tthis movie took so much from so many comics and different movies totally different than any other batman movie and in my opinion the best batman movie and quite possibly one of if not the best comic book movies and it just great movie0.0\talso like the detective batman but can you explain why does the batman defeat normal villain with gun and the super powerful engine cannot chase an energy saver car1.0\twow just wow the best batman movie ever mean like the fight scene and the mysteryall going on it just gave me goosebumbs dont want to say more to spoiler but just wow1.0\tthe movie is everything batman fan wants from movie reeves and pattinson create gotham full of darkness and mystery it is perfect thriller based out of gotham zoé and paul were also outstanding after the dark night we finally got new worthy batman film this movie deserves to be enjoyed on the big screen don wait too much go and watch it1.0\tmy opinion for what it worth the best batman movie ever and loved the ones by christopher nolan so that saying lot was skeptical about robert pattinson playing the caped crusader but this batman was so dark and brooding he didn have to show lot of emotion anyway zoe kravitz and colin ferrell did great jobs the plot however was stellar the worlds greatest detective actually did detective work and the creators didn have the villains in corny outfits like the 90 versions epic1.0\tthe batman was absolutely incredible only have few complaints but otherwise the movie was phenomenal robert pattinson fits bruce wayne so good his calm personality and cold face expressions matches how bruce deals with problems so calmly pros actors are chosen sooo perfectly to match each character like wow so believable also had really good soundtrack even if it means something in the way is stuck in my head now1.0\twell think by the title and rating you know how much enjoyed this movie it was honestly really good watch think like many was bit skeptical of robert pattison as batman but what do know about casting because it was such great performance one comment saw about this movie was that it was very dark one and agree on that one what dc do really well seems to be this dark noire type movies and if you re fan of those kind of films and if you re fan of the joker as well then would massively recommend this enjoyed the slightly different take on the characters as well for instance catwoman she was still this sexy thief but there was lot less stealing and being this only care about myself woman this film made you feel like she was an important part and just more likeable generally compared to previous films games that was view for all characters plot as well the focus on the wayne parents wasn too drastic like the previous movies and alfred wasn such pivotal character either could go on but it clear that they have tried to separate from the previous instalments and it all worked well for me batman was lot more dark as well which personally really enjoyed but can see why people would not enjoy the same way there was elements of emotion throughout but not lot and the plot would allude to his mental health occasionally which would explain the dark tone to his character you could potentially argue it was toned bit too much but me personally really enjoyed the route it took couple of things that want to mention was that really wanted to see alfred more as mentioned previously in the movie he seemed to be more of side cast and didn really appear all that much thought serkis did great job being him so would have liked to see that more the length of the film want to mention quickly as well it long one but thought the pacing of the plot was excellent never really felt like any scene didn belong and you tend to get long films adding pointless scenes for no reason but didn get that here do however always say that hour films are bit much regardless of how much it contains so it all subjective as people love long movie ll shut up now but yes recommend this massively if you re debating it 10 from me here1.0\tstory story and more story this is what cinema is all about tell captivating story with interesting characters that lead to an ending that makes sense love this movie plan to see it again for third time it is my favorite of 2022 so far1.0\tve been wanting to see this movie so bad for almost years now hell it could have even been more than now ive lost count with covid shutdowns and delays and this and that point is that it was worth the wait and then so much more this movie is masterpiece nothing less if you have doubts about don if you are putting it off don if you are waiting to see it tomorrow or the next day don see it before anything can be spoiled for you and just enjoy the ride the batman will not disappoint1.0\tacting cinematography background score and theme song story everything is perfect best thing have seen in recent times there is no need to compare it with the nolan trilogy ve enjoyed both both are amazing1.0\tgot goosebumps watching every scene casting was great and omg paul dano performance was more amazing not to mention rob worth the wait and hype an honest review here1.0\tsimply put this movie is masterpiece the cinematography is excellent and the acting is superb lastly finally batman is detective which has been missing in other film adaptation this film genuinely feels like the best parts of the comics and the animated series come to life1.0\tmany interpretations of batman have come and gone each with different spin on the character and world while nolan trilogy still remains definitive in my mind this film shows that there is more to be done with this character and if matt reeves continues this level of quality in sequels believe this will become the definitive batman before the performances the technical aspects and score have to be praised this film has the best atmosphere in batman film bar none gotham feels like character with gothic architecture mixed with the realism from the nolan trilogy gotham looks dark dirty and desperate without needing to tell the audience anything despite the darkness this film is gorgeous visually and the cinematography is fantastic the sound design is perfect and michael giachinno score is excellent heightening the already great tone performances are fantastic all around pattinson plays more vulnerable inexperienced batman who feels like his persona as bruce wayne has little to offer gotham he is intimidating without seeming unstoppable and struggles to balance the two halves of his life while others may dislike the lack of playboy bruce wayne we ve gotten in the past feel it is the point in this film that bruce wayne is cast to the side in favour of batman as the character learns that he needs to be more heroic rather than vengeful zoë kravitz is an excellent catwoman and one looking forward to seeing more of finally paul dano as the riddler is perfectly unsettling despite how little we properly see of him the only fault in the casting department is unfortunately andy serkis as alfred since he isn in the film that much and the scenes he does have don seem to carry alfred character as bruce moral centre father figure finally this film is three hours long and personally that didn bother me for this detective over action focus think the slower pace works really well there are some small plot elements that could likely be cut and the third act probably could ve benefitted from more proper set up overall the batman is fantastic adaptation of the character gotham city is the best its ever been and the psychological mystery type story works perfectly with the character combined with stellar visuals and sound great performances and some solid action this version of batman is one the best and can wait to see more of it1.0\tthis film has lot of things to love from the things you hear to the thing you see may give it hard time pulling its way up into my all time favorites but man the batman easily gave birth to my favorite film adaptations of penguin catwoman bruce wayne and batman1.0\toverall really well shot acted and written movie definitely worth your time would give it but it had its problems most of all would say that it was too long some parts felt unnecessary and could ve easily been cut out and replaced to make the movie feel more focused less messy and improved the pacing1.0\tthis movie was grast dark cast were great and the sound track was amazing there also hidden post credit scene where you have to open your browser and type rtaalada webpage will open and will ask you to solve three riddles after solving it you will download the post credit scene1.0\tit rare to say film is perfect we watched with friends and family all different ages and when it was over everyone said the same thing the best batman movie ever for those old enough to remember batman detective comics it true to form done in hybrid film noir style like the great detective films of the past the pacing and atmosphere is palpable brooding and the music keeps you on the razors edge the cinematography brings all these elements together and under matt reeves direction this new gotham pays tribute to other iterations while becoming it own world the actors all play thier parts with total commitment to this new vision1.0\tjusted wanted the film and it was amazing this film is master piece the story the cinema photography it all great really loved commissioner gordon the first time saw the bat suit felt that they took inspiration from batman arkham knight suit and it really fit batman1.0\tafter watching each and every character being held in such high regard that each actor lives and breathes the essence of their characters had nothing but faith in robert pattinson from the beginning and this shows just how underestimated he truly is as an actor1.0\tdetective batman check amazing villain check catwoman check one of the visually most stunning movies ever check incredible score check amazing movie its over there with the dark knight in my opinion and certaintly will watch it again also robert pattinson fits this role perfectly he truly was batman in this movie 95 1001.0\tthis is no longer superhero movie its dark and it shows more human bruce wayne and batman with more purpose you can enjoy this movie even if you are not fan of dc characters1.0\tthis movie is the next step for superheros movies the darkness and it connection to reality makes you believe this could happen in real life robert pattinson batman is the best portrait of the hero in the screens the whole cast should be recognized for it acting and matt reeves should be recognized for the wonderful screenplay he presented overall this movie breaks the tradional way of making superhero movie and can easily be one of the best we have yet1.0\twhat movie literally masterpiece in the first 20 mins it was kinda boring but then it became so damn good really loved every single thing about it and im 100 whoever didnt like this movie because they like superhero with super powers not mysterious and drama movie1.0\twhen it comes to superhero movies no other superhero movie can come near batman movie solo movie of batman has more craze than movie with lot of cameos no other superhero has more fan following than batman reason being he has no superpowers he is not relying on piece of technology one thing that enables him to fight against some of the most powerful creatures is his courage that makes him more than superhero he is phenomenon everyone can be batman if they are brave enough to fight against the evil normal people can have piece of technology to make them brave we have waited for this moment for long long time and finally its here1.0\tliked this more than no way home while everything was done nicely robert pattinson didn let loose guess he really didnt enjoy doing batman and he shows it had high hopes for him because in the lighthouse he was really great so im just upset robert phoned this thing in remember michael keaton lets get nuts well this batman bruce wayne is mute can recall much from him robert didn make his mark but everyone else did great they didn have big shoes to fill1.0\thonestly this is as good as nolan interpretation of batman the climax is incredible and is honestly one of the best have ever seen in movie dano shines as the riddler and everyone else has great performances aswell highly recommended1.0\tthis is the batman movie we were all waiting for matt reeves did it amazingly well robert pattinson zoe kravitz everyone did an fantastic job dc is growing so good am loving this movie soo much have watched this today but am going tomorrow again can enough of this movie1.0\tno matter whatever others say watched this movie in cinemas even marvel fan this is best dark movie marvel never make that type of movie1.0\tthe title tells us this is the batman of the big screen caped crusader that doesn share canon with joker the dceu the arrowverse the gotham tv show or titans let me know if ve missed one this is it this time we re getting it right this was implied by the fan hype as well but had some difficulty seeing what was so special we now had burton gothic take on batman the 60s inspired schumacher take the tactile and grounded nolan take the depressing joker take the edgy and 2deep4me snyder take and now bit of everything maybe the emo take robert pattinson resemblance to my chemical romance member in that one promo isn lost on me in spite of the gripes that as genuine childhood hermit have long had with the emos insistent on their loneliness and nonconformity despite having shared aesthetic and community as an earlier version of the penguin once said to another batman you re just jealous that genuine freak and you have to wear mask suppose there certain fincher feel to this one an apt choice just as nolan borrowed from mann and philips from scorsese and one critic voiced his appreciation at the lack of quick cuts letting us fully take in the fight choreography and its agonizing impact same as the superbly shot car chases which showed promise right from the trailers others joked about the wannabe edginess of things like paul dano riddler and likened him to jared leto cringe joker there is an effective and creepy villain there yes but it hard to ignore that they chose to turn character once played by jim carrey into this gloomy looking tarpaulin so yes don think the batman is wildly unique take on the mythos nor that it avoids the annoyances we ve seen in more recent adaptations having said that definitely wouldn call it bad and agree that it carries literal and figurative punches the best thing about it in terms of batman cinema may be the fact that it doesn show his backstory we know trust me on the cast my feelings are mixed pattinson while acting well isn all that mythical as batman many agree he should ve portrayed angsty newbie terry mcginnis instead of supposedly seasoned bruce wayne and selina catwoman kyle an excellent zoë kravitz feels more like the main character much of the time the highlights for me are the penguin colin farrell jim gordon jeffrey wright kingpin falcone john turturro and alfred the butler andy serkis and sure if you must do grittier and more serious take on the setting guess zodiac inspired riddler is logical follow up to joker that got cked by the mental health system the various corruption of the nolanverse and squeaky lex luthor who wished to behold clash of gods in okay no point is gotham city is sh thole in my mind this film and joker are the films that get the vibe down best even if the atmosphere of burton architecture and german expressionist angles is hard to beat in addition to the riddler zodiac parable there are some other apt fincherisms including the fight club like gangs of disenfranchised young men and the se7en like detective work of pattinson batman say what you will about his version of bruce wayne it about time the world greatest detective got to be precisely that in vast pulsating neo noir metropolis that as gotham ought functions as its own character last but not least is the score which is some of michael giacchino finest most haunting work bottom line for movie that letterboxd reviewer recently described as emo tumblr batman vs 4chan incel riddler this wasn all that bad the riddler is actually riff on antifa depending on who you ask and how you want to feel about him but let not be here too long1.0\tbest portrayal of batman in live action movie the sound screenplay story acting have been executed so well one of the best superhero movie of all time no doubts1.0\twhat can say about what saw in this movie this film gave me the whole feeling to be someone walking at gotham matt has prove him self by giving us what the batman is from the batman to the riddler from oz to falcon from the cat to bruce it all magnificent plan for movie like this robert pattinson played the batman in pretty way but zoë has all the thunder paul dano the oscar for best supporting actor must go to him definitely the batman is the best comic book movie ever made and don think doctor strange mom will have chance to be better then the batman1.0\tam fan of the character of batman from the previous batman movies including the 1989 batman with michael keaton and jack nicholson and the sequel batman returns with michelle pfeiffer and batman and robin with uma thurman and the dark knight trilogy directed by christopher nolan now we have new film called the batman with robert pattinson as bruce wayne and the batman the performances are mostly good and the film is very dark and gritty the best thing about the movie is the stylish cinematography by greig fraser who is nominated for an oscar this year for his work on dune the movie is too long at an almost three hour running time but it is never boring overall pretty good batman movie worth seeing on the big screen1.0\tthis one is way different than previous batman movies looking forward to the next part combination of both the villains is gonna lethal just felt it could have been shortened and trimmed by 20 30 mins1.0\twow was really sceptical of robert portraying the batman but omg how he changed my mind this take on the cape crusader was one that was never seen before robert shows weak and very human side of bruce wayne which is at the same time confusing and yet brilliant picture is dark as gotham should be and the villains are just next level genius and creepy absolutely loved it1.0\tpattison has proved himself as an actor so had know doubt when they cast him it would be good have to see this is possibly the best batman have seen the psychological aspect of it with bruce is what have always wanted to see never felt other batman really dealt with the darkness also thought the storyline of the riddler was relevant these white males that we see time and time again committing shootings our horrific crimes and feeling so justified then we debate the existence of psychological trauma or if they just wanna see the world burn loved zoe but definitely would have loved to see more of her story she proves time and time again her acting skills for me though it was collin that could not get over the transformation the indoor shooting scene with the lights out was the scene was waiting for as batman fan and it did not disappoint whoever did that bravo0.0\tsomeone forgot that batman is superhero slow boring and after three hours did not care for any of the characters easily could have have been 90 minutes bring back afleck please not sure where these positive reviews are coming from everyone left the theatre bored and in desperate need of caffeine hit1.0\trobert pattinson is the batman really like how they approached this movie they did it dark like it was intended to be the score was immaculate riddler catwoman and penguin were great the cinematography was also awesome they not only made batman exist the shadows but bruce wayne too which is something the other movies didn really do the opening 10 minutes is some of the best cinema ve ever seen this movie also has some of the best batman moments ever awesome addition1.0\tenjoyed the movie but not as much as the nolan dark knight series what liked well acted soundtrack what didn like too long because the editing is not as good as other near hr movies too dark and the you will struggle with some scenes think nolan got the cinematography right in his series of movies the action is mixed bunch and the lighting for the scenes are not done well the car chase scene after penguine is disappointing and is just mess and for movie with big budget it has to be one of the stand out sequences so score the movie out of 101.0\tbest cbm best batman the movie is dark batman is more detective than super hero the action scenes are just must watch it in theaters the movie is far better than the dark knight and bvs hope there will be prequel1.0\tlet me begin this by saying that this is the best looking batman movie out there and one of the best looking movies of this year so far matt reeves captures an aspect of bruce wayne that no other director even ventured to explore bruce wayne as traumatized man who still tries to heal his scars the movie is well crafted the central mystery is well built with riddler riddles guiding batman to the abyss of corruption and the dark past of gotham this movie takes it time to build gotham as city with its social hierarchy well established than the previous cinematic commitments matt reeves manages to hit that tone of doom and depression of the gothic kingdom by the dark colour palette and the magnificent cinematography of greg fraiser for me the movie was on its way of becoming masterpiece until the third act unfolded it was in nutshell unsatisfactory it didn do justice to all the enormous bulk of good things that reeves built in the magnificent first two acts of the movie overall the batman is fresh grounded psychological take on the caped vigilante and has done well enough to stand as one of the best comic book movies out there1.0\tawesome acting good fight sequences great story line and awesome music this movie is definitely worth the watch robert pattinson has certainly earned the title of the batman and want to say it out loud loved it more than batman trilogy because somehow it is very relatable and every characters actions are pretty reasonable none of the character had over the top depiction yes it is sort of detective movie but thats the beauty of it you will have to wait until you know the truth his parents reality and who the real culprit is1.0\tafter all those trailers boy does it pay off fresh new invent for cinema inspired by gritty comic with amazing acting intense acting and resounding soundtrack the gritty backdrop of gotham city and batman darkness persona make you feel immersed into the cesspool of the city with so much run time you actively follow along with batman as he investigates the riddler crimes who gives an amazing performance as psychotic villain with sinister actions love that the movie doesn focus on establishing characters more screen time is given for supporting characters that each deliver1.0\tit everything you want in batman movie it full of action mystery it dark and it has lot of batman characters in it have waited year and it was worth it it reminds me lot of the arkham games and seven and it was just perfect1.0\twhat love about this movie is that it draws you in you actually feel like you are in gotham city and involved with the characters in it it is so real and wonderful to be part of the experience this movie gives you the batman movie should be experienced in cinema to really appreciate it1.0\tthe journey of deeply scarred emo batsy from vengeance to hope cape crusader of the common man slow narration excellent shots less action felt like an oscar style drama flick riddler plays with the tragic but rich past of batsy stemmed from his own lonely neglected past lengthy watch could here my own breaths in the theatre as audience watched it in pin drop silence1.0\tfirst of all what cast secondly the film score was awesome not dull moment in the entire film was on the edge of my seat the whole time paul dano was the perfect villan and the entire film was gritty gotham city is what you would imagine dark tiresome crime throughout every corner and just intense the ending was perfect and leaves opportunity for matt reeves to continue to direct and bring in more villans could see great bane batman movie coming soon and would do well in this gotham setting hands down the best batman film1.0\tthis is truly the best looking batman film to date and it the perfect representation of the character robert pattinson and zoë kravitz gave remarkable performances and the score is outstanding but the story was unfortunately miss for me or rather not my favorite in the franchise matt reeves direction was solid0.0\tcould accept robert patterson as emo batman but this was boring as hell movie feel like need to watch christopher nolans and tom burtons batmans again just to recover thee were few stylish scenes scattered amongst the monotony of boring crime drama another director could ve made patterson emo batman brilliant but this was flat is the art of storytelling lost this makes me sad0.0\tbad acting implausible story got even more convoluted poor imitation of catwoman trying to look like angele jolie and start romance that never went anywhere lots of action beating up everyone in the county and loud effects did not make it rational like cheap video game to me could have been claude van dam epic1.0\tvillain 2nd to only joker its such different gotham than what we re used to every frame is filled with grim atmosphere of rain and flashing lights wouldn want second less from its runtime it perfectly edited it ties all the loose ends clearly well and also sets up for the sequel the narration of the batman at the background adds to an overall poetic vibe this is batman the detective batman whose rules are still not well established at its 2nd year batman whom the police force don trust fully yet the batman who still building confidence among the people of gotham many whistle worthy moments liked the entry of the batmobile more than the entry of batman himself and the car chase is better than batman begins even the suit is better than any batman suit out there it 10 10 but if you still force me to take down point then it would be for never giving us nail biting thrill like tdk at any point but as an elaborate gotham story it is above tdk and how it doesn convolute itself trying to touch so many characters is an achievement on its own batman is the brad pitt and gordan is the morgan freeman in this journey to unravel the mystery of se7en so many elements is fincher and also nicholsons chinatown kind of revelations as you keep going further in the story this is for fans of batman this is not for children though this is for adults who relish the darkness more than the cgi filled colorful entertaining fun ride of marvel the music by the oscar winner michael is refreshing from all the past takes one might wonder how can anyone better hans zimmer wouldn say this is better but this is different and possibly at the same level of zimmer if not above cinematography is oscar worthy and so is the acting the catwoman character is better etched out than michelle pfeifer in batman 89 though still prefer the matured cheekiness of michelle tad bit more want to polish my thoughts even more to get this overwhelming love for the movie out 2nd viewing is already planned and along with it would be many more whistles the action choreography is good and shot with stable camera rather than the poorly edited with visibility and terribly choreographed action scenes of tdk tribology however the warehouse batman action scene from bvs is still the best batman action scene ever captured on celluloid the batman voice is just bruce wayne speaking little more whispering than usual unlike tdk which has the worst batman voice ever where it seems wayne is playing pretend with other children also this is the first time you see the batman smeared in the sweaty black paint around his eyes which is realistic since they always do but have never been shown to have it when they remove the masks as bruce wayne still prefer bale or keaton may be because they play more mature wayne than the young hot blooded wayne played by pattinson but as batman robert beats anyone hands down also possibly because of the agile suit which doesn make him look too robotic with his movements the robotic movements were visible even with the modern tdk suit the batman never entered scene without an eventful score and camera angle in this film you can hear his approaching footsteps then the shoes and then dimly lit suit and finally the face it never straight forward1.0\twhile this film was mostly forgettable basically long version of tv episode plot appreciated how the riddles had two levels the type you expect on popsicle stick and then deeper mystery for which to put the pieces together batman always got the first level right away and for the second level appreciated how human he seemed sometimes making admittedly reasonable mistakes so if you re looking for world best detective batman this ain it and neither is it the playboy billionaire philanthropist bruce wayne you might be looking for basically it relatable human plus exceptional tech lot of time on his hands an uncanny ability to be at the right place at the right time and body that heals way too fast best part to me was how had no idea the penguin was played by colin farrell that guy has some serious talent and know not proving that point by saying this but still got kick out of the fact that he had to waddle like penguin at one part it the little things second favorite aspect of the movie was the usage of out of focus foregrounds and backgrounds finally don mind long movies in fact love when movie takes its time unfolding the mood story and characters but the ending and the car chase both dragged on way too long unnecessarily really took me out of it so yeah decent movie but if you skip it you re not missing much1.0\tenjoyed it more than the dark knight maybe just little bit more maybe because this is still very fresh need to watch it again cinematography soundtrack the riddler batmobile the bikes the action uffffffff1.0\tliked the movie it had good acting and cinematography had one issue with the movie didn like the white privileged line brought my rating down don understand why it necessary to put in batman movie1.0\tdon think that ve watched the best batman movie but they create an excellent fondation for something big if they decide to launch batman which think it will happen especially with such an end great acting and atmosphere loved the approach just lack some intensity sometimes but overall it good movie1.0\tthe batman was fun adaptation of the classic superhero batman rather than having the joker as the main antagonist like in many other forms of batman media this movie features frightening revamped version of the riddler that leaves mysteries for batman to solve the riddler in the batman is mentally unstable and more along the lines of jigsaw using traps and puzzles on his victims because of the riddlers nature and persona the batman is detective type movie where batman will find clues ultimately playing the riddlers game even so the movie is more than detective movie and won shy away from action the movie has dark themes and compelling story the batman feels like it was an rated movie based on themes despite being only pg 13 bruce wayne and batman are not disconnected in this movie meaning bruce wayne is just as dark and brooding with the suit on or not some people may see this as negative but see it as positive because it shows what bruce is doing is affecting him as person more than just him physically this version of batman is not graceful and he makes mistakes he is more reckless and in one scene goes on chase endangering people lives but think this is good way of showing how new bruce is to being the batman the movie also had very fitting soundtrack and great ambience the cast did an outstanding job and fit their roles surprisingly well from robert pattinson as batman to jeffrey wright as james gordon overall seeing this movie was very enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone whether they are fan of superhero movies or not concept performance plot writing logic pacing visuals sound fx enjoyment overall 46 50 or 92 positive1.0\twas really enjoyed each and every moment of watching this masterpiece the colors the acting and of course the puzzle of the crime not so much actions or fancy tech kit but the whole asmotphere brought some old fashioned noir detective crime film absolutely worth every pennies spent1.0\tthe batman one of the best comic book films simply put this film was absolutely incredible hour epic that feels like genuinely feels like graphic novel come to life performances were great across the board hard to pick stand out jeffrey wright as gordon took me by surprise and was one of my favourite parts of the film john turturro as falcone was nice surprise and colin farrell as the penguin was brilliant paul dano as the riddler was also terrific and creepy fantastic villain for this film zoë kravitz as selina kyle was superb kravitz is easily the best catwoman in live action film as for robert pattinson as bruce wayne batman he has shown time and again that he one of the best actors of his generation and here he shows it again he doesn really have lot of lines but his expressions tell you everything you need to know about how his character feeling or what he thinking think pattinson is my favourite live action batman although no one will ever top kevin conroy from the animated series and the arkham games and can wait to see more from him unlike most comic book films this very much felt like someone vision matt reeves did brilliant job directing and greig fraser as cinematographer made this film look truly beautiful as he did with dune last year the soundtrack from michael giacchino was really good as his music always is really don have any legitimate complaints with this one other than that feel it was too tame think it should have been more graphic film no idea why it was rated 15 here in the uk though yeah some very brief moments of cgi in wing suit scene and the third act weren great but they were so brief it doesn matter and yeah there was no real standout fight scene but that not what this film was about the film was focusing on showing batman detective skills and in that regard it succeeded where all other live action batman films had failed this is one of the best comic book films of all time definitely the best since logan 2017 go and see this really hope this trilogy gets completed1.0\tive always wanted to be girl in the late 2000s going to see robert pattinson movie on opening day today the batman allowed me to live that dream1.0\tthis movie brought back batman returning him to greatness and reminding everyone who the caped crusader is loved the pretrials of these characters and feel like jim gordon is super underrated and the riddler had some truly talented acting moments this is an all around great movie and definitely recommend1.0\texcellent detective story with bit of thriller romance action and everything paul dano scenes were chilling everybody performance was top notch0.0\tpeople say it the darkest batman movie yet the one thing this movie did well was to portray dark atmosphere in the form of gotham the rest is just garbage infused with woke themes batman is just some weak emo boy who fuels half ass fights with his prepubescent rage his arc can be summed up as going from deranged tortured soyboy to weak man who cares about children catwoman is just some random lowlife who into guys and chicks gordon is just part of the scenery the villain is caricature of himself and pales compared to scarecrow or the joker in previous movies no character has shred of charisma or any quality that builds empathy admiration or fear in the viewer on top of that the producers clearly tried to lace this movie loosely with woke themes having to pay for your ancestors actions reparations bisexuality black people are the good guys etc just weak really off to cleanse my palate with nolan batman movies they got it right1.0\tthis was amazing movie and the cinematography was absolutely beautiful for batman movie it was perfect we saw batman in like every scene they did the this movie so we ll and the riddler was amazing villain1.0\thonest to god great batman film it dark gritty suspenseful the tone is definitely closer to the nolan films and yet this still feels like very different batman it still remains fresh robert pattinson was great but lot more subtle than his counterparts but also felt more brutal while dont think we need the whole backstory shown because we all know his tragic backstory at this point do think we needed tad more to understand where he is in this point of his life paul dano as the riddler was truly unsettling his first appearance truly sent shivers down my spine however as edward nashton did find bit goofy zoe kravitz was good but dont think she was my favourite catwoman we don have to go campy like michelle pfeiffer dont think that would fit in this world but just needed bit more of sultry slinky purr in your ear type of vibe storywise loved getting to see the detective side of batman and think the unfolding of the mystery was well done the movie does feel fincher esque at times hints of zodiac and seven and although the film is long it doesnt feel it and honestly cant think of moment to cut and even though the film has pg 13 rating similar to other superhero films this is not very light film would caution bringing young kids to this film unless you know the can handle the subject matter overall great film and great looking film too have to applaud the cinematographer1.0\tthe new batman is here and from the trailers already had high expectations and can say with smile on my face that this movie lived up to them robert pattinson did raise few concerns in me but thankfully unnecessarily admit that christian bale remains the best batman for me but this one was also great and had something going for it but what the film did best in my opinion was the atmosphere it was absolutely fabulous it immediately drew me in and didn let go until the end even over hours in not everyone will like it the pacing is slower and most importantly this is bit of different batman it much more detectivey and rarely gets any action personally welcome this news warmly and really liked this detective style and enjoyed watching the various pieces of information being uncovered until the very end as mentioned before there isn much action but it all the better when it does occur now and then it really great and it felt quite realistic which made it even more immersive in short this is not some superhero action movie with full load of action and an immortal main character on the contrary batman isn as strong here and at times he takes beating from his enemies which adds to the aforementioned realism what added to the quality was the music which at times perfectly highlighted the moment and more than once got goosebumps or simply the feeling that was watching something spectacular would also like to mention the excellent chemistry between batman and catwoman because we have perhaps never seen such chemistry in any batman movie so the question is kind of whether this is the best batman movie how about it hard to compare because this one was vastly different from the previous ones and it goes its own way and it doing just fine by the way personally prefer christopher nolan batman but that matter of taste back to matt reeves batman though believe that some will love it for its change to the detective genre and others will find it long slow and mostly boring affair among those who welcomed this new release and for me it is wonderful film that recommend1.0\twas not the best movie that have ever seen but it for sure was an enjoyable watch and is the best batman movie that have seen if you are even just little bit of batman superhero fan this is must watch it is darker than the others in my opinion1.0\tthe batman brings lots of awesome moments and some terrifying moments that will make you feel like you re in gotham city with batman in the film the movie was raw gritty violent intense and far beyond terrifying when it comes to any batman movie series robert pattinson did such an amazing job as batman zoe kravitz was so talented as catwoman and glad she brought her best performance and has brought the best female superhero characters to life on the big screen batman and catwoman teaming up was fantastic totally recommend this movie so much and it deserves to be seen on the big screen in the cinemas one of the best batman movies ever made since christopher nolan batman movies1.0\tthe acting of the main character is very very good visual auditory effects and special effects are very powerful the pace of the whole movie does not drag and the soundtrack is very appropriate it has been great viewing experience1.0\thave gone to the movie because of robert pattinson but seems like came home with more than just that movie is awesome enjoyed each and every character and also loved the sizzling chemistry between the bat the cat wink wink loved how zoë kravtiz potrayed her character omg and her walk was damn good loved this movie1.0\tthis movie was great and what people are writing about this movie is just silly this movie is great from start to finish rob is great acting is good riddler is great 10 10 people saying batman to skinny what dummy and its to dark like have you ever read comic like stfu best film of the year1.0\tfirst half of the story may seem slow but that just the build up of the story second half comes as thrilling stunning experience robert did great job matt reaves did splendid job it filled with actions it dark exactly man movie not for weak people people who gave bad reviews saying it too dark it their problem not the movie1.0\tthe batman felt like it was made by people who cared about the mythology it was nice to see noir detective story and also younger inexperienced batman who was still finding his way catwoman penguin riddler were all respectably handled all on all good batman story it is little too long and didn care for the lighting of the film but it def worth seeing on the big screen1.0\tthere was so much loved about this movie it was incredibly filmed should definitely win an academy award next year for cinematography and set design every scene was crafted like painting truly amazing to watch on the big screen also the villain penguin and riddle were excellent the kind of criminals that are gritty and despicable human beings thought this version of batman did great job with the origin story without having to reenact something we ve seen dozen times hours is long time to sit and watch anything but this movie kept me entertained and engaged the entire time it was excellent right up to the last minute also don wait for scene after the credits like we did there isn one however the last minute of the actual movie totally set up the next film hopefully they ll keep going excellent job rebooting franchise that has been rebooted times or more1.0\tthis is the definitive and most accurate comic book batman experience we ve ever had and the best onscreen batman to have ever come out visually beautiful and impressive with the cinematography and the characteristics of the batman villains promise bright future for upcoming iterations of the rogue gallery with little improvement and deep dive into pattinsons bruce wayne in future installments he may become the full package of both bruce and batman we ve looked for for long time1.0\tdc may finally have found its mojo in the new batman simply fantastic dark classic and classy am huge fan of christopher nolan and it safe to say matt reeves has notched this close to the dark knight robert pattinson is subdued and on point to stake rightful place in the batman world post christian bale this one surely deserves dekho at the theatre1.0\twent into this with mixed expectations matt reeves is one of my favorite directors and was psyched when heard he was directing this robert pattinson however seemed like poor choice for batman but figured would at least give it chance pattinson knocked this out of the park his batman is the best version ve ever seen this bruce wayne is very different than any other version but he does it extremely well the plot itself is thrilling and keeps you interested the entire time all of the main actors did phenomenal job and the cinematography was exceptional would give this more than 10 starts if possible this is the batman we all deserve and based on the ending it looks like hopefully we will be getting more1.0\tno spoilers here at last we have been given the batman story it deserved true detective story batman bruce wayne learning by his mistakes there are so many star reviews from people that expected more action and less batman forget those fools if you re true batman fan this is definitely up your street1.0\tthey ve done batman in so many ways wondered how it could be different again without being bad and think they nailed it this is early batman year they wisely skip what we don need to see and get straight into it the casting is incredible ll be honest had some doubts but my doubts were shattered by the performances the idea is made clear that batman hasn figured out who bruce wayne is yet he too consumed with the batman project avoided reviews until watched it and predicted the negative ones woke and boring yes if you like your movies to be full of white good guys saving weak women from nasty foreigners you might get yourself all angry at any suggestion the world isn like that this film focuses much more on the detective side of batman which means more scenes of figuring stuff out rather than constant barrage of fights and explosions but there are plenty of fights and explosions along the way if you don engage your brain you may get bored from time to time it movie it subjective but really liked this one lot more than thought would can wait for more as they set so many things up so well1.0\tthe headline says it all yes to me this one is right after the dark knight this iteration of bruce wayne is like he is tired of fighting non stop and he is little introvert the film has also shown the sherlock holmes side of batman pretty well too which don think has ever happened many action scenes were very well done and the story itself too is very good must watch1.0\tnot batman fan but hell this movie made me one the story the meanings the suspense the movie is long but it worth it because every inch of this movie had information that would be nesscary as you watch it the fight scenes brought chills the batman theme came at the perfect moments the monologues made me want to repeat them myself1.0\tthebatman review longpostalert anytime new batman movie comes out there are few people who would always say it not comic book accurate know few who even didn like the dark knight because it wasn comic book accurate but guess what there is more to batman than the comics the best part liked about the batman movie was that it picks up its inspiration from everywhere the comic books the arkham games the animation series hush batman year one and the biggest one batman telltale games am huge fan of all of these so totally loved all the nods that the movie gave to different batman outings robert pattinson shines in his role he isn bulky as the comics but lean like the telltale or the animated series batman 80 of the movie he is behind mask and does perfect justice zoe cravitz looks the best version of catwoman and paul dano and jeffery wright kill it as the riddler and jim gordon the biggest hero of the movie is matt reeves the director he has successfully been able to bring all the major elements of the batman into the story and made it very interesting and captivating slight things didn like like the penguin been wasted and no role at all for alfred but perhaps that wasn needed at all the movie also finds its inspirations from iconic movies like se7en and zodiac both in terms of storytelling and the overall dark mood of the movie this one is both great fan service for the batman fans and also highly captivating suspense thriller how batman solves each riddle and cipher of the riddler is fascinating and indeed very iconic would give it perfect rating of0.0\tthe first impression was good very dark batman and pattinson was ok but it became worse and worse in the second hour nearly felt asleep and in the third hour just wanted it to end the good ratings have to be bought or some liberals wrote them because of the woke everything is the fault of white privilege elements1.0\tthe batman is brilliant superhero thriller it perhaps my favorite batman film in terms of structure sure it difficult to resist the eye catching style of tim burton batman let alone forget heath ledger petrifying portrayal of the joker from the dark knight but this new film taps primarily into the hero detective element which ve always considered to be the most interesting side of the character it something that been sorely lacking in prior cinematic outings this is refreshing take on batman grounded in convincing reality without straying too far from the eccentricities that give the batman mythos such rich identity the batman is fierce and grim mystery set in the early years of bruce wayne vigilantism where he unsure if he making difference let alone the one he intended and the police and citizens are skeptical of his actions and cause love that the batman doesn talk down to the viewer and avoids retreading the abundantly established canon of the character you can easily fill in the blanks regarding his past and present motives the visual style is beautifully gritty boasting what think is the best looking gotham city and the soundtrack by michael giacchino is intense brooding and tonally consistent overall robert pattinson performance as wayne is superbly nuanced after the lighthouse believed he completely shed the twilight skin and his crisp portrayal of the dark knight preserves that as for paul dano riddler all ll say is that enjoy villain that always miles ahead of the protagonist and makes interesting points not that his crazed actions are justified it fairly frightening take that probably won stick like ledger or jack nicholson per say but it chilling in its own right admittedly be lying if said didn feel the runtime of this film ve stated before that don mind long movies on the condition that constantly engaged and for the most part the batman kept me involved but some scenes could ve gotten to the point lot quicker that aside though in the years leading up to this film was very skeptical given the casting choices and overall decision to reboot the superhero again though to my surprise the batman exceeded my expectations new generation of the dark knight has dawned and the promise is subtle yet strong1.0\treally enjoyed pattinson as batman really enjoyed the story and villains would of rated higher but just feel like cat woman ruined it for me the story of her wasn needed in this film rather them point out oooh that cat woman and then her story leave there1.0\tsay it is very good batman movie however there are some glaring flaws that just cannot close my eyes for very weak bruce wyane the character hardly has any lines and is portrayed as more of an emo bruce wayne should be charismatic figure who perfectly gives out the rich and am proud of it vibe in order to eliminate any suspicion that he might be the batman that is heavily not the case in this film too dark and don mean the tone of the film mean the actual film needs some lighting in some places if fits perfectly master piece but in onthers it just hides most of the action some scenes would definitely benefit from an additional light bulb are ing you kidding me with that wing suit stopping here to avoid spoilers you won be disappointing if you go see it but doesn live up to the hype1.0\tloved the soundtrack the way they presented the batman at the beginning his speech everything was sooo good and well thought hope if they make sequel they will include joaquin phoenix joker1.0\tbringing us all back to where it begins the batman movie so different from any other batman movies is gritty detective film without god like opponents and fancy gimmicks instead as what matt reeves promises before camera starts rolling it delves into the essence of the batman comic series riddle solving and investigation1.0\twhat an incredible experience tdk still stands the number one spot but damn this one got very close the batman movie all comic book fans were waiting for completely unexpected result it is beyond superhero movie this is dark thriller that changes everything dc should keep this path waiting for the second one already matt reeves is amazing pattinson prove everyone wrong and paul dano one of the most underrated actors of our generation giving stellar performance1.0\tfirst off robert pattinson you did it you mad stard you actually did it after 10 years here we are with our first batman standalone film the beginning of new trilogy new era an even greater take on the batman as character where he shaken to his core still discovering who is he and how to manifest in being the beacon of fear to gotham most rotten pattinson does great in blending both bruce batman throughout riddler oz selina gordon also deliver on major scale nothing mean nothing feels out of place smart tease going into the sequel fully behind it this is batman1.0\tthe batman showed outstanding development with young bruce wayne the way that the movie was executed shows room for many more movies and characters to come the performance from pattinson and zoe was astonishing with the performance that pattinson delivered he is probably my new favorite batman1.0\tthis is the best movie of all the batman just watch dont want to spoil hfhrhrhrfkv5 fkfuhtnvufcrnu7frn7uc3i9njf4nj89f339f8nurinjf3cr9fnj98fn9j48vrcfjjcrrcr4m8icfm8jfrc9jimi9fmrc9fem9jifr4jim9frm9jifrijvr9jrvrfimj99ijf4n4v4nfj99n4jivfrn9ij4vfr9nijvrfr9n8jfvr4n9fvr4j8n9v4gtnj9jg t4g54v8in9vnig8591.0\tit been 14 years since christopher nolan the dark knight hit the theaters and became benchmark for batman movies with the return of the caped crusader once again on the big screen matt reeves had grave responsibility to reboot the batman franchise which the warner bros are trying to achieve from last so many years ever since its announcement expectations of the fans were sky touching high without further ado let analyze matt reeves the batman cinematic analysis the film starts with batman narrating the significance of his bat signal in the sky fear is tool says batman won spoil your experience here by stating the rest of the lines undoubtedly this is the best batman intro have ever seen in any live action film it not only sets the tone of the film in our minds but also helps in connecting with this version of batman can describe how much want to relieve those initial moments again and again matt reeves gives us vulnerable superhero roaming in shadows and hiding his pain and grief of loss beneath his suit batman now from two years is seeking revenge and haunting down the criminals in the dark nights of gotham city he calls himself the vengeance one of the strong aspects of this film is its portrayal of gotham city is driven by crime and corruption and the hopelessness roaming around every corner city where it nearly impossible to tell whose better cops or criminals michael giacchino level ups this representation by his fear inducing soundtrack the batman tells gripping investigation story with all its ends tied well batman goes full detective mode this time solving the riddles plotted by the infamous gotham villain the riddler those who are familiar with comics and animated films are definitely going to recognize the source material from where this film draws the inspiration acting is top notch and when say this it for every actor both in lead and supporting roles robert pattinson is terrific in his role as batman and so is paul dano playing the riddler to whom we see without mask for very little time but he didn miss that opportunity to impress the film is brilliant in every technical aspect from cgi to cinematography from action sequences to dialogue writing now it time to talk about some of the weak aspects of the film the major issue observed in this film is the transition between the scenes the film is almost hours long and still we don get to see how the riddler operates and how his behaviour is when he alone and planning things andy serkis as alfred pennyworth is the least effective portrayal of the character but hopefully he will be given something to act upon in the next instalment of the film won go into the discussion and comparison of this film with nolan the dark knight let us leave this discussion for some other time conclusion in finality matt reeves masterfully crafted reboot stretches the limits of pg 13 and gives us dark gritty and haunting gotham and strong yet vulnerable protector the batman proves that it price worth paying and sets strong foundation for the upcoming instalments follow on instagram m_movie_reviews 101.0\tcharacters 10 10 detective battinsn 10 10 plot and action 10 10 villain 10 10 cinematography 10 10 ending 10 10 overall its masterpiece and want to say dont compare year batman with year 20 batfleck we know that batfleck is another level but think battinson will do great job in future restorethesynderverse batfleckmovie1.0\tprobably little overhyped but still great this version of batman is really good and feels more unique from the other versions of batman the action is visceral and heart pounding the detective stuff is great the acting is incredible and the true cesspool of gotham is shown very well but have couple issues that take it down for me length is never an issue for me if it is used to it fullest but this movie is little too long for what it offers think some of the character relationships are left in the dust bit like alfred and there are many themes introduced but not fully explored the riddler felt little silly to me although in hindsight like him more he feels realistic but it hard to get past the silliness for me think the sequel will be able to do wonders with this version of batman and gotham0.0\tsaw all batman movies read the comic read more and listened and watched too much to be honest about this character so know the batman and what saw in the movie was slow dark depressing unimpressive version of it spend almost hours in gloomy movie waiting for something to happen someone who surprise me unexpected surprise extraordinary villain but nothing happened patterson is good actor but not batman one zoe was good selena with high potential for promising career most actors were good but the script and the plot simply boring monotone and lakes character development some good action scenes and that it seriosly0.0\tif your at the cinema and contemplating watching this film don do something more entertaining like licking the carpet for hours this film would bore anyone to the point of walking out0.0\tno chemistry between characters very little action more of murder mystery than superhero movie the entire tone of the movie and soundtrack followed the nirvana song something in the way throughout the entire movie except for the couple of times they played ave maria absolutely did not like ben affleck as batman but he did much better job at playing both bruce wayne and batman than pattinson could have ever wished he could have reached as long time fan of batman truly blown away by the number of good reviews as this was nowhere near to batman movie yes it was dark and yes it was gotham but it was not superhero action movie1.0\tthis film is probably just as good as tdk the acting is incredible music is amazing and even though the film is long the story keeps invested the whole time the opening 15 minutes are the coolest opening to any batman film ever the action scenes are great not to mention that the cinematography was perfect saw it in an early access screening on the tuesday before it came out and when it ended everyone was on their feet cheering absolutely amazing huge congratulations to those who worked so hard on it those who are holding on so tightly to tdk yes that movie is incredible however it was iconic for its time the batman has arrived1.0\tthe best comic accurate movie ever its worth watching after being hyped for years in this movie we can see different type of batman while the film runtime leads to some bloat reeves noir influence the batman stands out as the darkest and most visually inventive film starring the caped crusader its kinda horror movie new type of cinematography like the tdk real detective true vigilante and the perfect villain riddler robert pattinson did his 100 the perfect year one batman movie will give 10 10 recommended watching0.0\tvery bad almost stupid movie my kid watch this movie and it is boring for him too 12 years old just ignore and watch something else maybe dot on white wall1.0\teverything about this movie was flawless the acting the shots the story the development the villain absolutely amazing go and watch it asap1.0\tawesome movie casting is great acting is awesome and characters is incredible would highly recommemd the movie its well made with lot of action1.0\tpeople should watch this movie but without any baggage people need to understand this is not continuation of the nolan trilogy or the batman in the snyderverse this is fresh take on the batman the cast is amazing acting is good and the riddler is just wow do not let the near three hour run time come in the way just go and watch it you won be disappointed vengeance is awesome0.0\thollywood has jumped the shark on this take catwoman bringing real life topics in this fictional world the entertainment industry is supposed to be just that not political arena1.0\thad extremely non realistic high hopes for this movie and it absolutely crushed right through and was even better than had anticipated saw this movie couple of weeks ago very early screening and since than there was not day that went by where didn watch interview trailer totally obsessed just go watch it hours that felt like or less1.0\tits hard not to like and apreciate this movie unless you are hater the batman is different noir detective style driven superhero movie it completely different than what the majority population accustomed too with this genre and all for it and want it more everyones acting in their respective roles is an game and gonna cemented them as this generation batman catwoman penguin riddler falcone gordon alfred etc etc matt reeves promise us detective noir movie and hes deliver every bit of it greig freiser with the cinematography blew any major blockbusters that came before it through the water giacchino with simple yet already iconic rendition of the batman gonna ring on mayn people ears for decades to come if you are batman fans and get what this character is all about will love this movie last but not least pattinson is born for this role1.0\tthis is the one who should be in the dceu it exactly what it missed good mystery thriller action and suspense seems like this is the door to different dc universe1.0\tthe cast are amazing the action is amazing the drama is amazing all can say is the movie is really really good it like amazing since tdk the dark knight thank you matt reeves for directing this masterpiece and this movie is like chief kiss1.0\tthe batman is remarkable film very well crafted with an exciting script and beautiful visuals the score is outstanding and stands out as one of michael giacchino best to date matt reeves direction is phenomenal and the film is both perfect detective mystery noir action romance and drama but also an exciting introduction to this new interpretation of the batman mythos1.0\tthere is so much to say about why this movie is the best batman movie not counting the animated movies ever made so far but it way better if just do really quick rundown on all the previous attempts which fail at all the things this one succeeds in tim burton great gotham great bruce wayne batman nicholson is pretty decent joker in my opinion all the rest is really bad and it really didn age well joel schumacher oh god no batman directed by adam sandler zack snyder good god please no at least schumacher batman movies are funny christopher nolan this one is wild great cast but they don really do anything remotely close to their respective characters his movies don feel like batman movies but more like nolan movies somewhat inspired by what christopher nolan has heard about batman not even so sure they hold up as just movies let alone batman movies the worst type of mediocre is the one that really tries to convince you it actually good and as for this one respect for source material respect for the characters respect for the story respect for the setting that is the city of gotham respect for the psychological depth of the dark knight narrative good dialogue 90 good acting fan of colin farrell but first bullseye and now this sorry he sticks out like sore thumb among all the other wonderful performances not even sure it his fault but no oswald cobblepot deserves better actually pretty well made movie overall camerawork pacing acting script the plot itself good stuff the music could ve been better lot of the atmosphere of batman just doesn click if you don do the dramatic orchestral thing that has been otherwise done in all the previous movies and the animations and the video games so yeah this one is worth it0.0\tthis was soooo slow took me back to the stone age of batman movies please for the love of god donot make part previous batman were wayyy better would really appreciate come back from them rather than continuation of this snooze fest1.0\tpattinson was good they made this batman more humanlike liked that don wanna give spoilers about that you will feel it when you watch but but but it was not supposed to be 2h 55m no after some point thought was watching the movie in slow motion1.0\tthe plot is rinse and repeat batman style but more similar to the comics than the other cinematic versions absolutely zero twists in this movie the pace suffers from too much explaining and not enough showing don mind pattinson as batman the romance is very unbelievable from the get go this is forgettable movie all in all at no point was cheering for any of the characters to complete their motives1.0\tthere was so much noise and distraction about this movie leading up to its release in theaters at the top of that list was the criticism dc comics and warner bros for casting robert patterson as batman bruce wayne but like said that is noise and distraction one crucial expectation to make clear about this movie is to differentiate between those viewers who love the comic books and the anime versus everyone else this expectation was made clear to me after watching the movie opening day the movie involves depth about both the heroes and villains it is dark calculated and is true dark knight on the other hand there is everyone else who is used to the marvel disney mold for movies it is all the same story but with different characters the movies are bright gloomy and they all give you the same feeling walking out of the theater except for avengers infinity war when they finally took risk but then quickly snapped it out of existence with endgame year later this crowd will probably not enjoy the batman this movie involved an incredible amount of depth in each of its characters what most enjoyed was the history of thomas and martha wayne to the arkhams and carmine falcone another aspect of the movie that really liked was its offering of gotham here it showed more of the city itself and how the corruption vined its way through the city batman bruce wayne this batman was intense he was truly the dark knight was shocked at the minimal screen time that bruce wayne had it was about 75 batman and 25 bruce wayne but will say one characteristic he lacked was his ninja shadow ability there were many points throughout where crime was in progress and you could hear his slow methodical footsteps nearing you understand it was there to add weight to the fear of batman that the criminals had however believe it takes away from batman skillset also was not fan of the collar leading from his cape to his mask it was just strange and did not blend well with his suit selina kyle catwoman when comparing to previous actresses who played catwoman zoë kravitz blows the rest out of the water she was catwoman at her truest form she was nimble unlike any of the others enjoyed the selina kyle origin here and how she fit into the bigger picture of the puzzle riddler this riddler was more of hush from the 2019 batman hush movie he was much more cynical had nothing to lose and had batman right where he wanted him traditionally speaking riddler will be step ahead of batman then batman will quickly catch on and stop riddler hush would take things step further and even threw batman off when it was revealed who he truly was that is how paul dano riddler felt to me when he was suited up saw him more as hush than riddler but then when he was out of the riddler suit saw him more as the riddler penguin could not believe that was colin farrell as penguin he really changed his image to fit into this role however do not think it was worth the cast at least for me did not get that full penguin vibe when comparing to the anime penguin highly recommend watching the batman it will please the comic book and anime lovers for everyone else try not to compare it to marvel movie and appreciate it for its true worth1.0\tgive big props for the studio for doing different type of batman film there have been countless films and this film seemed so fresh it more noire detective then the other batman films and it worked the first 30 min was little shaky for me but it picked up and got really good tho the run time was long the cast was surprisingly good didn know how would feel but all the actors did great job and shout out to zoe as catwomen she was perfect it one of the better batman films and enjoyed the fresh take on it1.0\tthis is fresh take on batman which think we all needed after the recent editions this is very much detective noir film we finally get to see detective batman on the big screen there isn whole lot of action but when it is there it very well done was fully invested in the story the characters are great all these actors did such an amazing job bringing them to life the score of the film fits perfectly with the scenes don listen to anyone that says it too long or too boring they added later upon later and developed this story well it did not feel like hours to me just go see it for yourself1.0\tloved and enjoyed all of it it was shot beautifully sound was wonderful and all the actors involved were all fantastic hope it does well as it really deserves sequel it was one of the best batman movies and deserves huge praise robert pattison surprised me in the best way possible cat woman riddler and penguin love cannot say enough good things about the movie but to sum it up dark beautiful and twisted as batman should be0.0\tthis movie got nothing but visuals yet fighting action scenes are very poor characters are not developed at all most of the villains are more boring than scaring batman got the same face expression for the whole movie even without the mask plot is flat how many times we ve seen this kind of story thousands times but with better dialogues1.0\tyeah heard good things went in hoping for it to be great its mix of grunge noir emo and comic style it kinda reminded me of sin city at times they way it was narrated and how the darkness was used to affect rp is decent batman different in way much better than expected catwomans character is done well but would have liked to have seen more from her the riddler is great very good performance and penguin is hardly in it you wouldn think for minute it was colin farrell they didn go too gimmicky with the characters which liked however they didn put enough time into bruce and alfred relationship so you didn really care about it the story hmm it different take on corrupted gotham predictable and slow at times some bits loved some thought were bit tv movie but dragged out for hours1.0\tthe batman 2022 is one of my favorite batman movies next to the dark knight 2008 robert pattinson is absolutely fantastic as batman bruce wayne the character was really intimidating and awesome seeing in action scenes especially love how they show batman solving the riddles and him walking around the crime scenes alongside jim gordon jeffrey wright was great as jim gordon and loved the partnership between batman and jim gordon on the crime scenes they are at odds but they work really well together zoe kravitz as catwoman selina kyle was great and liked how much she would struggle with batman robert pattinson and zoe kravitz worked well together paul dano as the riddler was fantastic he was creepy disturbing insane brutal and would be funny in how he would act against batman really liked andy serkis as alfred you can tell how long he has been there for bruce but wish alfred was in more of the movie because of his great performance colin farrell was great as the penguin and he had funny almost sophisticated personality the performance of john turturro as carmine falcone was surprise on how well he did the action scenes were excellent and really well shot the action scenes had long takes and moved really fluid like batman looked awesome in the action scenes and was entertaining the movie stays true to the comics and stays true to some of the comic storylines as batman fan loved how they brought it to the big screen definitely no spoilers matt reeves made fantastic batman movie with great mystery dark tone and is comic accurate definitely recommend watching this batman fans will love this movie1.0\twhile am an enjoyer of the stories that past movies would dive deep into about the life of bruce wayne definitely like this change of style where majority of the movie is just batman stopping bad guy it cool seeing him be detective and it also got awesome action0.0\tdisappointed understand the joker movie did really well and was very dark and not for kids but they tried to do the same with the batman and for me it didn work out the same they should have kept this one for the kids and not have gone so serious with it plus didn like this version of batman for the first time my young son fell asleep during batman movie that says it all for me1.0\tafter watching the trailer was little disappointed by still thought that should give this movie shot and omg was amazed by the acting direction story music and what not wish robert pattinson stayes the batman forever now1.0\tit dark it complex it gorgeous almost saw esque thriller with every actor bringing their game paired with musical score that leaves you riddled with tension and anxiety in all the best ways this is the best batman film to date repeat this is the best batman film to date1.0\tnot my favorite batman film but great one nonetheless fantastic addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for cinema lovers especially on the big screen1.0\tlove robert pattinson he was good in harry potter great in twilight but as the batman he is superb this movie digs bit deeper into batman character than in some of the previous versions it is gritty and dark we meet the penguin catwoman and very disturbed riddler there is just sense of current affairs with few references to white privilege etc if you are fan of dc comics you will love this film have never read even one comic book and love the film am ready to go see it again1.0\trobert pattinson proved doubters wrong and also proved that vampires do in fact turn into bats the batman 2022 is work of art true comic book movie oscar nominations to all and few best supporting actor awards to kravitz and ferrell for there wonderful performance when watch this movie finally see the batman that believe the world deserves0.0\tstop it is hugely uninteresting film it is dark dull and badly acted save your money and leave the vampire to his twilight trilogy could not watch it past 20 minutes why do they think we need yet another remake it was an insult to previous batman actors0.0\twatch movies to be entertained to go out of my normal environment to see something different fabulous and fantastic am not into masculine women with short hair so lazy and repulsive sorry so who would love this it is recommended to hardcore batman completists hollywood franchise fanatics fans of catwoman the new star trek like discovery ds9 and even for the new call me kat series rest of us should look elsewhere1.0\tmatt reves batman is more detective themed movie yet there are action sequences time to time as well being detective movie the story feels like there is puzzle and batman is solving the puzzle through out the movie and at same time batman realizes that he is part of the same puzzle overall the movie is good feel the end could have been better in terms of plot and not necessarily the story this is the reason when you feel that the movie is long the background score was great throughout the movie cast performance was like they did what they had to do some are saying that the movie is equivalent to dark knight to which totally disagree but yes it worth watching and spend your money on this one1.0\tthe batman is no doubt one of my favourite superheroes after the slightly disappointing utilization of batman in the dceu we get another interpretation of batman from director matt reeves the premise is when the riddler sadistic serial killer begins murdering key political figures in gotham batman is forced to investigate the city hidden corruption and question his family involvement so does the film deliver an excellent take on batman or is it another disappointing utilization the biggest thing appreciate about this film is that it is fresh and new take on batman one of the iconic titles of batman is that he is the world greatest detective but we never see that get explored in any of the previous batman movies matt reeves focuses on this aspect of batman throughout with him using his smarts to solve the mystery instead of this being the generic superhero movie it instead feels more like detective noir thriller and love that the story itself is very engaging and love watching batman try to unravel the mystery it is also very grounded and more realistic take on the character it never feels like batman is superhuman or using gadgets that are too futuristic for example the batmobile is not super over the top military tank like in the dark knight trilogy or the dceu it just muscle car with giant engine and it is still awesome nonetheless it helps bring you into the world and also really makes the audience feel like batman could get hurt in these fights the cinematography in the batman is gorgeous there are so many shots in this film that make the city of gotham feel alive it is the best looking batman movie so far on that note love the interpretation of gotham in this film it is dark and grim which illustrates how much of hell hole gotham is despite that the city still feels alive at times and there are moments where gotham can still look beautiful which shows worth in batman protecting gotham the music is scored by michael giacchino and it is phenomenal the music score he made elevates every scene and fits the story being told he also made new theme for batman and it might become one of the most iconic batman theme songs because it is that good there isn lot of action sequences in this film but when there are it is pretty good they re not going to blow you away like the batman superman 2016 warehouse sequence but they are still fun nonetheless although there is very awesome car chase sequence and it might be one of the best ve seen in batman film ever robert pattinson is awesome as the titular character batman the way robert moves and the way he talks as batman is just sight to behold he actually makes me believe that criminals would be scared of him also love that his batman is flawed and makes mistakes also appreciate that he does go through character development with him learning massive lesson by the end colin farrell is also great as the penguin props to the makeup artist as he looks unrecognizable as the character praise must also be given to colin himself as the way he speaks just works for the character and it doesn sound like how he does in any previous movies additionally paul dano as riddler is exceptional casting the riddler as character is incredibly goofy but paul dano manages to make him feel genuinely creepy and smart the riddler feels like worthy adversary to batman in this film the rest of the cast also do great job andy serkis isn in the film much as alfred but love this more fatherly take on him jeffrey wright gives more buddy cop take as gordon with his friendship with batman being highlight in the film zoë kravitz gives more emotional take as selina john turturro makes carmine falcone feel dangerous however was little disappointed by how bruce wayne was in the film what makes batman great is that bruce wayne is different persona from batman bruce wayne acts like playboy and party goer while batman is the broody vigilante unfortunately there is no difference between bruce and batman in this film batman is broody and so is bruce wayne which is shame as think this is great aspect of the character get why they went in this direction as in the film bruce only wants to be batman still would ve liked to see robert give two different performances for these personas instead of just one broody performance also have an issue with the relationship between the two characters which feels very unearned and sudden not going to spoil it but you can probably guess who overall this is the best batman movie since the dark knight 2008 matt reeves delivers terrific batman movie it is gripping detective thriller that is no doubt one of the most gorgeous superhero movies to date furthermore stellar cast that all give remarkable performances an amazing music score by michael giacchino and enjoyable action sequences the batman is still one of the best to be done in live action and am glad to see that there are directors who can still give us something new with batman can wait for the future of this batman franchise0.0\thaven fixed off this many times in movie since was forced to endure little kid films with my boys speaking of at 14 years old they didn like this movie either this film lacked soul there was no substance the only thing liked was they did not rehash an origin story1.0\tthe movie is amazing the actors without exception are perfect especially robert patinsson who is great in the role of batman in my opinion he made the best batman in cinemas giving heavy and sad charge to the character1.0\tso have just watched the movie and am still thinking about it so decided to write down how feel please disregard the rating as honestly don have one clearly in mind at the point of writing this review first want to say that batman is by far my favorite fictional character have watched all the movies read the graphic novels and in my mind the best and truest represantation of the character was in rocksteady arkham trilogy as feel that they most intricately understand what makes the character so compelling before the batman came out must have watched the trailers hundreds of times this is genuinely the first time that was so hyped for movie honestly think that the second trailer is the greatest movie trailer of all time literally became tired from the excitement when the time finally came for me to experience the movie as was counting the seconds up to release and now after watching the movie really don know how to feel the overall vibe that you get from the footage shown is nothing like the actual movie have watched lot of great movies in my life and don stray away from heavy ones that deal with deeper subjects that being said this movie definitely takes itself way too seriously there is no dynamic to it it literally hours of basically nothing at all it just sad and miserable all throughout and thought might actually appreciate this after reading the reviews but honestly it lacks any sort of excitement at all the overall pacing of the movie is all over the place just when you think that something epic or badass is about to happen it pulls the brakes immediately and you are left in silence and an overstretched non engaging discussion it almost comes off as pretentious because the writing is just so basic and even though there is some brutality in the movie it just plays it way too safe there is pretty much nothing thought provoking that was said or any quotes that stand out to be remembered feel like this is one of the weirdest movies have ever seen or at least the strangest direction they could have went with batman but that also kind of commendable in way at least it almost like theather play and sort of shakespearean like some reviewers have mentioned guess you could compare it to something like se7en but without much excitement or payoff it sounds like being all negative but honestly at least appreciate the movie for being authentic without obvious agendas and true to its vision it honestly impressive that this movie kind of works or even exists in this state but due to the cast being extremely commited to their roles they somehow manage to pull it off one of my biggest disappointments is that due to the film being the way it is michael giacchino soundtrack never gets it moment in the spotlight all in all even though the movie is far from the masterpiece that thought it would be it still builds world interesting enough for potential continuation and sets it up with really interesting scene that don want to talk about here due to spoilers really don want this post to sound like hating on the movie really appreciate the wonderful cast and the love and passion matt reeves has poured into it just don think that it worked out as well as he might have hoped1.0\tloved it robert pattinson batman is already top tier looking forward to hoping for more of his bruce wayne in the future films zoë kravitz is the catwoman riddler incel manifesto was legit chilling grounded in reality batman and his villains can easily be lame but this definitely works not sure how feel about that tease at the end but we ll see1.0\tthe batman is vigilantee film not superhero film there isn eye gouginh cgi or the prototype good vs evil plotline matt reeves breaks all the traditional stereotypes and presents us story where masked vigilantee is involved in an ongoing murder investigation much of the movie is like 1940s noir rather than an action film robert pattinson zoe kravitz and jeffrey wright are brilliant casting choices colin farrell john turturro and paul dano have done justice for their characters but they don have the true antagonist feel unlike the tdk trilogy unlike nolan reeves touches on the political aspect of gotham to give perspective of crime and justice from the lend of batman the ever present bond between bruce and alfred has very little substance in this film batman stands out unique unlike it predecessor due to its noir style story telling but like the tdk trilogy it has an incredible instrumental score cinematography and mild octane action scenes the 2nd installment will be tough challenge but reeves has laid out the easter eggs already1.0\twow this was my ideal batman movie for one love batman so was already hooked when this started filming years ago and secondly am obsessed with good mystery thriller movies find they are very hard to come by more recently this is batman movie like no other the genre and tone are closer to se7en and very very very dark even has some jigsaw elements in the mix and definitely giving some neo noir vibes matt reeves takes batman away from the super cool fancy gadgets and over the top action sequences and instead brings the detective aspect front and center aligning the bat to the comic book versions the voice overs remind me of sin city and had me ecstatic in the first few minutes of watching robert pattinson definitely surprised me as bruce wayne no twilight sparkle here he was dark and brooding little bit like an emo teenager with the hair at times but was very stellar zoë kravitz was also great as selina kyle she embodies the sleek smart and sexy demeanour we have expected from this role the bat and the cat have great chemistry together which in part sells you on everything in the film paul dano as the riddler just makes whole lot of sense have you seen him in prisoners this role is perfect for him especially loved the attire the riddler rocks in this film gives some crazy realistic imagery colin farrell is almost in recognizable as the penguin and john turturro is solid carmine falcone rounding off the good guys we have jeffrey wright as lt james gordon and andy serkis as alfred both are solid in their respective roles truly hope there is at least one and hopefully more sequels to follow the batman staring the above cast0.0\tthe film was very boring the plot made no sense since you could not tell the characters motivation very few action scenes and the ones that exist arent anything special0.0\tboring trying so hard to be nolan bale batman but fails miserably the riddler is the only bright spot and if being honest he just rip off of heath ledger joker pattinson batman voice is excruciating penguin is just an italian american mobster like tony soprano rather watch clooney batman everyday for the rest of my life than watch this again1.0\tthe batman was nice break from all the mainstream superhero movies that show the overly chaotic and the sunny side of superheroes and their world the batman sets whole different mood with the dark and noir setting of the movie the amazing cinematography the bright lights to contrast with gotham darkness and the phenomenal background score that always kept the audience on the edge of their seats the movie showed the real and gritty side of gotham city and its dark past shedding light on the crimes committed by the corrupt city officials and riddler mission to bring them to justice or his idea of justice the batman had some stellar performances from the cast and the onscreen chemistry of the bat and the cat was really great the action scenes were realistic showing the human side of batman the batman also showed bruce wayne making peace with his past and his thirst for vengeance as he is seen leading the people of gotham into new light an improved city where people have faith in their government and that there is hope for the city to change the movie did great job in reviving the batman movie series and made an lasting impression the batman will surely go down as one of the greatest superhero classics1.0\tthe strange world of batman and film has always been just that strange what started out as something awesome with the classic burton duology started to lose some steam with batman forever not bad movie but bit of mess only to then lose all integrity with the infamous batman and robin one of the worst superhero films of all time so much so that any and all future plans of the series were canned and the caped crusader wouldn see himself on the big screen for another whole years and while that wait was 100 worth it thanks to the nolan trilogy being one of the best of all time there has seemingly yet to be batman film as good since then while ben affleck is excellent as batman and one of the most underrated of the bunch the films themselves ranged from bad to just pretty good and no more not counting zack snyders justice league because that has them all though will say that film was excellent and huge improvement over the 2017 original at this point you re probably thinking okay what your point my point is that was not expecting this film to somehow take the caped crusader to heights never before seen mainly because of how all over the place the batman films seem to be over the years of all of them however this does the most superb job at replicating the comics as it keeps the fun action and characters while also keeping that dark tone batman is famous for speaking of which the direction is absolutely wonderful as stated it dark but it also incredibly gritty heart pumping and perfectly put together as it all wonderfully paced it very noir kind of film and it works very very well speaking of working very very well the performances are all phenomenal robert pattinson has proven time and time again that judging one bad performance from series of bad movies is bad idea because he actually really good actor and this film helps cement that even more in this movie batman bruce wayne is bit more laid back than some may expect what with him being very broody but it actually works better that way in this film because of how seamlessly the film tells the audience how bad gotham is and how it could bring anyone as busy as him secretly as the caped crusader would be pattinson was consistently believable and gives the character focus that makes the character all the more badass zoe kravitz as catwoman was awesome as well as she really honed it in as possibly the best version of the character since michelle pfeiffer collin farrell as the penguin is not only worthy of the label of an excellent performance but also the best damn makeup and costume design in movie in long time it was so believable that would have never have known that was farrell until seeing the credits great job from him and the makeup artist paul dano as the riddler was also incredible as he really takes the fact that he crazy and takes it even further sure jim carrey did great job with that in forever by acting wacky and silly but here the riddler was crazy in the sense that he was actually kind of terrifying and incredibly dangerous and dano performance was excellent everyone else did phenomenally as well jeffrey wright as the famous commissioner gordon andy serkis as alfred john turtorro as the evil falcone and everyone else in short everyone was great speaking of great the writing pacing and action are all top notch for hour film it didn feel that long that because there just so much to it and it really does go into the fact that batman is detective and does it well there never dull moment in the film as there always something happening and the way the film does it is not only mature but also riveting the action is great as well mix the excellent choreography with some high stakes and some explosions won say what from to avoid spoilers and it all fun the movie score is great too and one of my favorites of any modern film it simple but so effective and helps the movie flow that much better overall there really nothing about this movie dislike to me it the perfect batman movie dark fun violent smart riveting well directed and well performed throughout know some may point to films like the dark knight and say that the best batman film definitely think it one of the most ambitious legendary and gleefully fun ones out there plus who doesn love heath ledger legendary version of the joker rip heath but this film hits so many right notes that can really choose which one love more this really is my kind of movie and one that has ignited my hope for more batman films to come if you re fan of the caped crusader this is an absolute must watch as it for what it is is as great of batman film can get even if you re not and this is your first batman film this will be one hell of an introduction sure it can seem bit overwhelming at hours long but trust me when say that it so good that it ll feel like1.0\tthe batman is unlike any previous live action superhero films or even batman film you have seen it the only live action film of batman to truly showcase one of his many strengths in the form of his detective skills it detective film which uses tension strong cinematography as well as great set design to create what is the best iteration of gotham and its inhabitants that we have ever seen in live action setting robert pattinson paul dano zoe kravitz and other actors stand out and help create realistic flawed characters with so much room to grow over possible sequels for this new reeves universe this film has great direction and never feels like it drags on over its near hour run time it has great bad ass moments as well that fans of the character will love it not just popcorn flick it it vengeance personified and to me 10 101.0\tdifferent perspective on the history of batman the film has good story and thought the photography in the film was the best ve seen in long time every shot was thought out to perfection was very surprised 10 101.0\tif you were expecting the dark knight walking into this movie then you will for sure be dissapointed but if you are expecting just absolute beautiful cinema then this is the batman for you mathew reeves is genius genius for following the comics portrayal of the batman for the first 10 min of the movie got little nervous because it wasn the batman that was used to but after little bit of seeing the most accurate bruce wayne and most accurate batman combo was surely surely satisfied overall the writing in this movie and cinematography is just perfect perfect perfect perfect and huge thanks to michael giachino for being the best composer of all time next to james newton howard and hans zimmer as for the acting there could not and repeat could not have been better cast paul dani made the movie alone with his preference on the ridler just genius and if didn know before the movie that colin ferral was the penguin would have never guessed it as for robert pattinson bravo my friend you played the absolute best version of the batman that anyone could ask for where as with the other batman they were seen as two characters batman and bruce wayne your version matched the comics of the right balance of billionaire playboy and the right balance of dark rich vigilante and zoe acting can go without saying as the perfect cat woman too hot sexy straight to the chase hurt broken and flexible movie deserves an rating rating it to boost the score1.0\tthe quintessential batman film almost everything about this film is perfect in my eyes robert pattinson is now my favorite batman he brings new layer to the character and we see how batman has essentially pushed bruce wayne away we get to see that obsession with batman that people only ever talk about this batman is an inexperienced batman he is only in his 2nd year of fighting crime so he makes mistakes and learns from them he goes through very compelling arc that fighting for vengeance isn the goal fighting to protect others and bring hope to those who have none is the goal there scene at the end that does this and it probably my favorite scene in batman movie paul dano riddler is amazing dano gives performance that can rival ledger joker although ledger is still better he terrifying in scary and funny way colin farrell penguin is highlight as well he completely unrecognizable here and brings plenty of comic relief to his performance zoe kravitz catwoman jeffrey wright jim gordon and andy serkis alfred are also absolutely phenomenal the story revolving around batman learning the truth about his parents and the city of gotham is very compelling and engaging story for an almost hour long movie wasn ever bored sure you could definitely cut small handful of scenes out but the film is very well paced in that regard michael giacchino has one of his finest scores on full display here it will get stuck in your head almost instantly and really does great job at showing how characters feel and adding tension to scenes the action here is phenomenal the highway chase is incredibly well edited and shot and batman fighting criminals feels brutal prefer the action scenes in the dark knight but it still great here the cinematography and directing are all fantastic the film looks beautiful in almost every shot and you can see matt reeves on full display here definitely excited to check out more of his work unsure if the dark knight or this film is my favorite batman movie would highly recommend checking this out when you get the chance1.0\thave never had more excitement for film in my life was lucky enough to be able to see it at the premiere tonight along with second viewing for tomorrow afternoon courtesy of amc investor connect and another viewing thursday at 12 am courtesy of amc crew and tickets for opening night received bought all of these prior to the review embargo lift date even being announced that how hyped was for this movie with that being said this has quickly become my favorite film of all time now that just personal opinion but critically do believe this is the best comic book movie ever not going to sit here and compare this to the dark knight they are very similar in approach but vastly different in execution christopher nolan created realistic batman in realistic world matt reeves created realistic world with grounded batman to occupy it keyword grounded view the difference between grounded and realistic in simple way batman is comic character end of the day things cannot always be realistic with him that where christan bale batman fails in my book they were trying too hard robert pattinson take on the batman has the aspects of the comic book movie characters but grounded the world around the batman is highly realistic and true to life but the batman himself is not entirely realistic he grounded highly recommend seeing this film in imax the most immersive you will ever be with gotham edit forgot to mention the brilliant performances in this movie massive shoutout to all the main cast from rob and paul to collin and john the most outstanding of all performances was jeffrey as lt gordon originally had my doubts but this is the most alive we ve seen gordon ever absolutely livid and genius1.0\treeves goes out of what is usually super hero movie and brings us very entertaining thriller with great villain we couldn expect less from dano through intrigue and with the necessary action touch to carry us through the hours and presents new more human and vulnerable batman is it better than nolan don know but don compare them just enjoy it1.0\tfilm was perfect robert pattinson killed the role loved it he looks perfect in the mask not fan of him without mask but loved him in it zoe killed it too0.0\tcannot emphasize enough how abysmal that movie was it constantly questioned the intelligence of the fans the plot holes were borderline endless and the entire movie lacked any sense of excitement besides random explosions cannot imagine worse bruce wayne than we got along side mediocre batman this is not the dark knight this was random and aimless film with mediocre villain being chased by the worst buddy cop duo in cinema1.0\tit nearly perfect batman movie literally everything about this movie is virtually perfect decision there is one thing missing from this movie it needed scene with falcone penguin and mob sit down to just further the development of those characters other than that it great firstly the whole backdrop of gotham felt so alive gordon was ridiculously good robert pattinsons batman is better than bales batman his whole feel and the way he is as batman was brilliant when he bruce wayne the mentally broken bruce wayne was great take and excellent to see catwoman was fantastic sexy deadly and an overall great performance from zoe kravitz the penguin falcone and the riddler were all very good like guys seriously everyone delivered exceptionally well in this movie the noir feel of the movie was amazing it so immersive the club scenes were so good the fight choreography was brilliant 10 the storyline produced for me complete immersion into this movie 11 there are scenes in this movie that were astonishing to me 1st scene is when around 15 officers are all pointing their guns at riddler 2nd scene is when falcone walks outside handcuffed and around 50 cops are all standing there looking at him 3rd scene was when around 30 officers and gordon are in cell yelling at batman that scene was quite something the movie is artistry0.0\tdidnt like the act of robert pattinson he must play in romance movies not the batman this movie is always action no love no romance didnt like the movie at all1.0\twhen heard that robert pattinson was batman was extremely hesitant to see the film but was pleasantly surprised with movie would put in my top 10 the soundtrack the acting and the cinematography made everything come together harmoniously1.0\tthis was in my mind the best batman movie ever made wasn overly impressed with any of the actors but the movie was phenomenal great story and well made1.0\thonestly didn have much faith in him when he was first announced in the role but wow were my expectations way too low he really knocked it out of the park1.0\tdon know where to start robert pattinson has done great job in the movie especially the the voice and love how batman becomes this dective and superhero at the same time this has amazing action 10 10 recommended1.0\tthis is the best thing to have happened to dc wb since the dark knight trilogy hope zack synder took notes this isn your typical superhero movie it mystery drama gangster drama as much about gotham as it is about tb very different origins take that could have gone totally wrong but didn the opposite of that in fact around the 2hr mark the movie met my expectations and have walked out satisfied but there was more and was glad great cinematography the movie dark literally and figuratively with bunch of colors here and there used intentionally and used very well red especially you may not have have seen this much red in batman movie before sound design and action so much better than expected great writing and editing shoutout to whomever wrote the humor part of this movie that is how you do humor in dc movie instead of trying to do it the marvel way this is one of those movies you ll appreciate more with each viewing so glad it not part of the dceu but that shows how much of bummer it been against the mcu all of that said the dark knight continues to be the best batman movie in my books maaaaybe this would topple tdkr on my list too early to tell this year so far imo the batman spiderman no way home yeah said it fight me1.0\tsaw this movie an hour ago it is pretty dark probaply the darkest approach to batman in dc movie and even though it is rated pg 13 the movie kind of did push that age rating to its limits actors were great it was well shot and it manages to keep your interest throughout the whole film the opening was very strong also definitely one of my favourite in comic book movie the fight scenes were pretty entertaining and thats coming from someone who can be easily bored and critical about action sequences in movies also it was very atmospheric like was there in this dark rainy and very dirty city thats some of the things liked it still isn as good as the dark knight but it still is pretty solid comicbook movie detective thriller0.0\tgood attempt however hours too long my god if you re watching this in the theatre go easy on the drinks robert patterson portrayal of batman was as moody teenager which became little annoying after while andy serkis was too young in my opinion to play alfred on the plus side story line was very good and colin farrells penguin was excellent time was wasted on falcones character when penguins could have been developed more oh and more lightbulbs please know it dark but come on1.0\tthis film is probably my favourite batman film the cinematography was beautiful the red and orange colour palette was perfect with the dark colours and love how lot of the time the background was blurred out it creates really nice effect and really makes you focus on the characters0.0\tfound this movie was the only batman movie ve seen to date that disliked terrible choice in actors terrible plot terrible movie truly disappointed1.0\tas someone who has loved both dc and batman thought this film is an excellent adaption of the original story line from the comic books if you re batman fan you will absolutely love this version if this is your first exposure to the character highly recommend the batmas as an introduction1.0\tthe plot of the movie was really interesting the storyline was well written and the characters were well developed bruce wayne aka batman robert pattinson was amazing robert acting was oscar worthy good job selina kyle aka catwoman zoe kravitz was astonishing and badass was rooting for her through the whole movie zoe acting was great as always the riddler was nice villain the action scenes were so intense and breathtaking was shocked of how well edited they were also it was very dark movie not scary the effects were very well and most of them were very realistic even though not fan of the batman movies this one made me love these movies in my opinion that movie was nice introduction of the franchise to the new fans really hope they re gonna make sequel we need it moreover robert and zoe were an unexpectedly good duo that would never imagine by the way didn get bored at all last but not least the ending scene was nice and gladly there was happy ending1.0\tliked it really built the world up great characters very beautiful there are some problems the story was little to long to much talking could have sped it up it had ok action great detective excited for me1.0\tall these negative reviews are just marvel fans because there now another dc film that ahead of all there films only second to the dark knight the entire movie is masterpiece with elements such as seven and zoodiac makes this an even better watch the acting cinematography score characters are all superb and perfect in their own right1.0\tnot typical formula of superhero movie but interesting point of view of the world greatest detective wish they portrayed bruce wayne as playboy billionaire instead of broken man can tell you this batman is the best batman1.0\tmasterpiece in storytelling performance cinematography and music it not your regular superhero film the pacing and acts are totally different from other films like dark knight or burton batman it more like the long halloween and that exactly why it amazing it hrs long but the film doesn waste second of it the film respects the audience by not holding their hand and explain everything to them instead it shows enough clues that by the end the viewer gets the whole picture1.0\tdespite my feeling that batman and alfred were miscast and the awful voiceover at the start and end of the film actually really enjoyed this dark and gritty adaptation of the gotham knight1.0\tso watched it in imax not quite sure what expected but it was different than any other batman film or any other film ve seen in my life really it almost as if they took comic book and brought it into noir realistic reality would have to say it the second best noir film ve ever seen second only to double indemnity it has nice way of guiding you through the detective adventure it is quite low key and drastically different than the fast paced hard hitting nolan films my mom is really into mysteries think she ll love this my dad will love this because of the profound positive message it has perfect use and execution of voice overs acting was superb literally everyone held they re own onscreen so much so that you just want to see more and more of them really hope they release an extended director cut there was one or two parts you could definitely tell they edited to reduce run time which is really my only complaint the sound was gorgeous but not over stylized and could hear everything even in imax unlike nolan batman was skeptical about the batmobile when they first came out with the production photos but now man do love that car awesome chase scene ahhh the cinematography so beautiful in dark and sinister way loved the close up and extreme close up shots and use of focal length spectacular stunts and special fx they really need some awards or major credit for this great car chase and fight choreography scenes epic but subtle mostly score that works well with this film great song choice downside to the film is the limited interaction between characters because they re so interesting you just want more and more this could have easily been hours and wouldn have been bored of it seriously hope they release an extended version and continue on with at least trilogy this is the kind of film the world has been longing for so when can we get rated batman film if they pushed the envelope more this could have been one it is kinda nice to make it pg 13 so it more accessible though it not like it hurt it with it being slower film it may not appeal to general audiences as much as hardcore fans thought maybe they were going to end it couple different times but was so glad they didn but it not like they had false endings that dragged on or anything like that will probably definitely be seeing this multiple times in the theater man this is tough to rate due to it being so different than regular films rating 10 yes think it better than dune even though you really can compare them1.0\tdark gritty surprisingly amazing ve never been so hooked so early on in movie and stayed hooked until the last minute 3hrs felt like when it was over was left wanting more already waiting for one thing ve always enjoyed about batman was his detective skills and he the greatest detective alright and he makes us believe it ever so effortlessly last but not least the music holy moly ve been listening to it for the past week now and after living it during the movie still not done1.0\tfelt like very complete movie had sense of realism to itself and the raw fight scenes were very well directed would prefer watching this batman any day over the excessive cgi and mary sue style scenes you see in the mcu the casting was apt and they all performed very well the movie soundtrack and general portrayal of gotham was excellent1.0\tso the first 20min in was like wow crazy thing is hours in was still wowed that hasn happend since the last batman movie that mattered the dark knight rises mean ben did nice job but who was he kidding right what did not expect is that robert would ace the part didn had high hopes for the movie because lot that wb and dc touches ends up totally unworthy of the great comic book names they carry however having seen tennet and the lighthouse had still little hope for robert paterson fast forward in cinema today and got totally blown away by robert michael keaton meets christian bale robert paterson man did he deliver brilliant batman not to give to much away of the story this movie goes back to the comics of the dark knight with touch of the 90s batman cartoon it is dark and griddle in an gotham as we know it from the video games trilogy wb and dc finally got there heads out of the sand and got to really look into the character development this is batman the world greatest detective hunting for clues in an insanely dark world limited gadgets and pure batman that was enough for me to stay interested for hours mis kravitz also deliverd aaa performance being the cat woman we deserved since ann hathaway who did decent job in the dark knight rises all in all do yourself favor get rid of your preconceptions and go see the batman0.0\tboring and very very slow is this batman movie the movie drags on and on without purpose it is like reading 800 page novel to the director this is not some epic psychological masterpiece this is the batman stick to simplicity action humor and visuals no need to stretch 15 second scene into minute dialog and when the action finally arrived it was amateur night understand the charm in going back to classic batman but neither the production set nor the music score match the classiqueness this was failure in my opinion1.0\tpattinson batman takes break from the eccentric playboy millionaire bruce wayne to take on more serious and damaged bruce still fighting to escape his past and let go of his anger this noir detective batman is welcome is welcome rework and explores darker tone for an iconic hero this new probable trilogy is one with the potential to rival that of christian bale batman1.0\tas huge batman fan owning all the movies and the entire seasons of the classic animated series this is simply one of the best interpretations of the caped crusaders robert pattison plays young reclusive and broken batman bruce wayne in his second year as the dark knight robert performance is spectacular and really brings character to life you can feel his emotion through his eyes and actions and reminds that the batman is still human can make mistakes like everyone else paul dano as the riddler is brilliant and haunting coming off as one of the best villains in comic book movie zoe kravits brings brilliant and fresh interpretation to the catwoman character and colin farrell is unrecognisable in his looks and performance as the penguin loved the film from start to finish and would highly recommend it to any true comic book batman fan its se7en meets batman and boy does it deliver0.0\tfrom the neck up he has absolutely no physical presence probably dripping wet he may get up to 85kgs but how does scrawny skinny guy no shoulders beat up 10 heavy set men with batons weapons he missed leg day arm day back day chest day mon we are supposed to believe someone his build can beat up other men please stop it1.0\tnice piece of cinema and wonderfull experience but the creativity where is the creativity reeves took zodiac se7en and reaplaced detective for the batman and vuala dc already made trubute to the king of comedy with joker now wonder what is the next film to copy1.0\tits simply story to understand but at the same time its amazing and it makes you exciting the movie is hours long but didn felt the hours only felt like hour and half that how good it is the ending is good too wee need more like this1.0\tpeople will break down the movie in million ways no that is not the way to watch this masterpiece simply sit back and let it whisk you away it is true joy to be alive in this movie era batman is 2022 reminder of what cinematic experience can truly be thank you to the entire cast1.0\tthe movie was hands down amazing in my opinion it beats the dark knight if you love mystery spooky feeling and just good spent hours definitely go check it out my favourite batman so far1.0\twhere do start the narrative flows so seamlessly especially in the first half of the movie and every shot of gotham could be hung from wall music is grungy and dripping with atmosphere haven been so immersed in movie since seeing blade runner back in 1984 and it really combines the realistic detective aspect of crime whilst interspersing enough action to bring out the inner child in me every now and then could watch hours upon hours of conversations between gordon and batman at crime scenes so interesting for me the thing admire most about this movie though is the fact that it hardly had any comedic moments it was dark and serious from start to finish and that what kept me so immersed the only problem was that alfred should have had scene in the end and think riddler should have not given up to the police so easily he smarter than that but overall 10 10 you be hard pressed to find more atmospheric movie than this1.0\tthis could have been film about any vigilante trying to save city from terrorists set in the gotham batman world it works well but the clever focus on the mob corruption and terrorism makes the film work at many levels highly recommended and at almost hours gripping from start to finish1.0\tdark moody and absolutely riveting this is how the batman should be in my view it has overtaken the dark knight as my favourite film of the bat having seen the film twice to confirm my suspicion that it tops the magnificent nolan trilogy tough call know the batman is dark moody and utterly compelling throughout it runtime the bat is played as someone you would not like to meet at all if you were on the wrong side of the law other characters are played equally well the riddler is an unhinged maniac and believably so looking forward to the sequel already1.0\tthe batman 2022 is slow paced investigation thriller where the movie is packed with intense action scenes which is so perfectly executed the depth and intensity of each characters is covered by matt reeves the cinematography and direction is in its peak the music by michael giachhino is eery and flows according to storyline of the movie speaking overall the movie is not usual superhero action stuff but the action scenes in the movie is top notch and to specially mention the casting for batman is something to be really appreciated at the time of movies announcement had doubts on robert pattinson but he proved it all wrong he is definitely one of the or the best batman we have seen in live action next to mention is the riddlers performance he have done it in its purest form never expect this to be usual superhero movie it is investigation thriller movie where it also satisfies mass action audience in which batman plays his detective role as said it is the perfect movie in every aspect1.0\tthought it was great this is batman in his early stages still learning the ropes in gotham city pattison did nice job as well and we saw the dark side of bruce wayne the penguin was my favorite villain in this and colin farrell was unrecognizable wasn too crazy about the riddler paul dano nailed the character but ve always been fan of the original 1966 series jeffrey wright did great job as james gordon might be one of the best to date did like how they made the dark and gloomy because it set the mood in gotham city this is worth the watch and it will keep you on your toes for good hours haha1.0\tloved the cinematography style and acting in this film imo the gritty dirty disturbed tone was appropriate for gotham and for batman to me this film had the stylistic weight of the more darker batman comics dark lines and stylised shots you could imagine comic illustrator creating found this batman to be the most believable he was disturbed isolated his wealth was realistic and his sensitive mortality was acknowledged it made the idea of vigilanti dressed as bat more believable to our modern senses the only draw back that took me out of the story was that the gore did not match the weight of this film not gore thirsty person but some blood splatter would have made the physical scenes more convincing but also think this would have been distracting and understand they needed to keep it pg my sister did not like it at all in her opinion it was boring and she didn appreciate the acting and she walked out mid movie imo if you go in with the expectation of marvel by the numbers entertainment you may be disappointed and if you really prefer entertainment over style and substance this move might not be your jam1.0\thaven had an experience like this in the theater in long time amazing sound acting cinematography strong sunset blvd chinatown and se7en vibes batman is big part of my life from the rebirth detective comics to epics like the long halloween knightfall and court of owls there are many different takes on bruce wayne and the batman it impossible to please everyone absolutely loved this take on bats and the crew every second of it0.0\tthe action was the only redeeming quality the movie dragged on the villain was cringe and thought the plot was mediocre the writing wasn very good won discuss further so as to prevent spoilers but the action made this movie bearable otherwise we would have walked out1.0\tbest movie have seen in ages such fan loved it so much ahhhh was freaking out about how it such good moive of batman it was this was the best batman movie have seen out of all the other ones 100 to go see you ll enjoy it gives you everything1.0\tthis movie is jam packed and have lots of different elements and was better than no way home in my opinion think that being long one is an upside in the theater was immersed by the amazing sound design and the fights were beautifully choreographed1.0\tso have heard very mixed reviews about the batman am going to say this it was great film and understand the mixed reviews it is very film nior and am big fan of that genre it is an acquired taste must admit sat in the movie theater watching it like was watching old detective films when was kid it is gritty dark and action packed to boot it is not as off the wall as most super hero movies it has many plausible aspects especially with today technology it was very grounded in the mystery and growth of the batman the music was woven throughout overpowering the senses whenever certain character was on the screen the powerful bass keys pounding on the piano ensured that you understood that the batman was there to conduct business for batman fans the writers paid great homage to the cannon weaving several story arcs throughout the batman universe from the catwoman story in year one and two the fight scenes looked like something out of the arkham video games his cowle looked like the adam west batman his toys appeared to be plucked right out of the comics it has been years since watched movie in theater it was special to share the movie going experience with other batman fans the theater goers were quiet and did not move from their seats it appeared that the movie was so entertaining that it kept their attention throughout the duration as for the question of robert pattison play bruce wayne the batman haven made up my mind knowing that this was based on the very beginnings of the batman career it is hard to peg if his performance was based on that zoey kravitz was great salina kyle catwoman my only gripe is that there was line that the wokeswole couldn help themselves with this was the only line they were able to sneak in colin ferrel was unrecognizable as the penguin and was phenomenal hope they keep his story line going if you are on the fence about this dcu film it is well worth it take the leap and go see it hope didn spoil it to much for you1.0\tjust saw the movie the batman it pretty good movie with that being said was very hesitant in the beginning in seeing the movie to think that the kid from twilight lol was going to be batman lol anyhow saw it was mesmerized by pattinson acting he was pretty good as was watching him was seeing bruce wayne batman however have to be honest enjoyed much more the christopher nolan trilogy better thought it was much more entertaining than the batman would have to agree with others saying this movie is is similar feel to seven joker 2019 which was good but really depressing it was not bad enjoyed it zie kravitz was awesome was like whaaaaat she awesome loved colin farrell very unrecognizable as the penguin andy serkis was great may also say paul dano was chilling with all being said couldn help liking christopher nolan trilogy better thought there was more chemistry btw christian bale and anne hathaway characters in the dark night rises either way everyone has their own opinion it was good movie but will not be seeing it again also prepare for slow pace type of movie1.0\tthe story action music and acting were all absolutely phenomenal and already make this solid movie but matt reeves goes above and beyond in this adaptation handling the character of batman with immense care and respect pattinson is absolutely one of the best bat men across all of the adaptations right up there with christian bale and possibly even better depending on what side of batman you are most interested in to me the movie doesn hold anything back if you want batman you re getting batman for 95 of the film and that good thing paul dano was fantastic as the riddler his character is truly disturbing and his motivations and actions felt very believable finally don buy the star reviews of this movie it not deserving of anything less than green screen movies like no way home are much more flawed than the batman but they get pass because they re not supposed to be taken too seriously or you are supposed to turn your brain off this movie treats the audience with respect and offers fresh take on the icon that is batman the batman strives to be so much more than the average super hero movie and it absolutely succeeds 10 101.0\treally like this movie am not one of those people some may be dissapointed because they expected something that was sort of copy of this movie which would not make much sense in my book to be honest1.0\tnever ever witnessed batman movie like this way matt reves brings the real batman pattinson nailed it don compare batman movies with one another every movie is unique in their own way and universe soundtrack is amazing especially in climax took me to the edge of the seat1.0\tironically in the aim of trying to keep this short the batman is quite good movie with genuinely funny moments riddles and one liners especially in the first act in all that grittiness under lit spectacle and persistent darkness however this movie hate it or love it is an undeniable replica and rehash of what christopher nolan has already given us with splashes of gotham yes the batman centers its batman theme primarily around him being detective but nolan already gave us batman being detective and truthfully he did it better even though he didn center his theme around that characteristic just simply even looking at batman begins vs the batman head to head comparison batman begins easily wins the better batman christian bale batman begins the better bruce wayne christian bale batman begins the better alfred michael caine batman begins the better gordon gary oldman batman begins the better story batman begins the better batmobile batman begins the better length and pace batman begins and the dark knight rises vs the batman as far as selina kyle goes zoe kravitz was good but anne hathaway stole the show yes the batman is set in the early stages of batman mantle but in the context of artistry that unfortunately is no excuse as this is chosen vision by matt reeves not one forced on him when it comes to gotham the batman set design felt almost exactly like that of gotham and though it was really good suspect gotham set design was still better as for the riddler and penguin gotham and the batman comparison this is the only aspect believe the batman may have done better and that only may have which says whole lot because the riddler and penguin on gotham are amazing but paul dano and colin farrell truly played their parts with some spectacular poise from there the batman replicates the relationship between batman and catwoman so closely that towards the end their interaction and even script looks and almost sounds exactly the same the ending of the batman essentially replicates the ending of batman begins with the same villain the score of the batman is extremely reminiscent of batman begins that even certain triads sound almost the same and then switch to different notes and melodies the flood in the batman mirrors the water vaporization in batman begins and the hostility bruce tends to show alfred was done pretty much the same way in the batman as was in batman begins but as the pattern of this review reveals the latter did that better too again the batman is good movie but honestly it is simply just an enjoyable and competent knockoff of christopher nolan iteration christopher nolan did it right and it sadly somehow makes this movie feel somewhat unneeded though it was fun to have gotten it and though realize that most people will definitely disagree clearly personally feel that matt reeves failed in delivering anything different or different enough to warrant new and fresh perspective and essentially doubled down on an approach we ve already seen before and seen better pun intended but ll repeat the batman is good movie nonetheless 101.0\ttrue piece of art the start of film shows the true meaning to batman how others see batman and how he sees himself the movie is exactly how the batman should be potrayed the movie is litteral piece of art recommend anyone who haven watched the movie to watch it0.0\tthis movie was the most boring movie ve ever seen robert pattinson acting hasn progressed much from twilight this is the first movie ve walked out of in years1.0\tsaw it with my brothers on an imax showing my first time in an imax theatre it was great highly recommended this is batman unlike other iterations this is pure batman the worlds greatest detective solving crimes you can get more batman than this batman matt reeves really hit it out of the park ve read enough batman comics to know that this is more like the comics than any other movie that came before robert pattinson makes great batman in this style this is batman heavy movie not 50 50 bruce wayne batman where you see bruce wayne attending dozens of galas it is more batman than wayne so refreshing when the mask comes off pattinson his performance slips bit with his broody ness and awkward performance but it sort of fits for his portrayal of batman andy serkis plays alfred pennyworth in thankless role wasted talent love serkis very small role paul dano is favorite of mine and he does not disappoint here although you don see his face until the third act colin farrell shines under the heavy makeup as oswald the penguin cobblepot the car chase between batman and oz was out of this world beautifully filmed hat tip to greig fraser dop the score and music is amazing score is reminiscent of imperial march from star wars at times great story from start to finish true detective story true batman with probably the best batman mask ever on screen no tight fit around the lips that makes lips protrude like ducklips my writing sucks high school dropout just wanted to get checklist off my imdb account write review1.0\toutstanding after waiting for months we finally got it and the movie was outstanding lived up to all of my expectations like how the movie plot wasn revealed in the trailer and was gripped the entire film although the third act of the movie wasn as gripping as the first two it was still incredible and have to give it ten pattinson does an amazing job as both batman and bruce wayne and will be rewatching this as many times as possible1.0\tthe set pieces were great the music was brilliant the atmosphere was completely immersive and yet didn care for the characters as did when christian bale was playing the character still good movie that was worth watching on the big screen0.0\treally hard to watch lots of criminals to keep track of bring scorecard way too long too dark as in lighting even the sound was too low in parts sit next to speaker ridiculous scenes of cops doing nothing during shootouts car chases fights murders characters were not properly introduced or fleshed out can say that thought anyone role was well acted credit the director was thinking about walking out after couple of hours but stayed until the stupifying end0.0\twas hoping to be pleasantly surprised but this movie was so weak all of it no one performances were convincing very poorly casted way too much hype over nothing1.0\tand this movie left me speechless was so happy felt like didn blink or move an inch for the entirety of the film it was perfect the cast was perfect this was year batman story and watching the character grow throughout the movie and realize he needs to be more than just vengeance was incredible can put into words how mesmerizing zoe kravitz is as selina kyle catwoman sexy beautiful smart independent etc she now my favorite non batman character paul dano riddler felt like he was taken out of movie like seven could go on and on about this movie but don like to spoil things all wanted to get across to people is see this movie asap0.0\tnot sure how people on here thought this was good movie it was another white man bad woke lesson too much talking only gave it stars because of some of the action1.0\tdid not know what to expect with this film the batman was different and dark film enjoyed seeing him become detective who tried to solve puzzle they let go off the playboy billionaire and focused more on life as the batman am grateful they didn show how he became batman and the death of his parents almost everyone on the planet knows this origin story pattinson is great batman and brings this dark broken and complicated batman to life this batman seems like more realistic vigilante for the adults who has his own issues it reminded me of some of the darker batman comics that loved reading cat woman penguin and gordon were great support to this film amazing make up for collin farrell great direction that really set somber setting the only thing would say is there was so much going on in this film that certain elements could have their own storylines liked how they showed the radicalisation of people that occurred online something sadly happening lot these days great intriguing universe has spawned from this batman so many great characters backstories and enigmas wasn blown away by the film but pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it this was win to stick to one main story and plot look forward to anything that could develop further in this space0.0\tthis movie was similar to nolan third installment but far inferior the action sequences sucked the music sucked except the nirvana song was well placed the plot twists sucked and so did the depiction of bruce wayne just horrible bruce wayne selena kyle was competent but what was up with her mask penguin was great though for that give it one star but the worst of all was batman he wore heavy tread boots that rattled when he walked seriously heavy boots that made noise when he walked he was afraid to jump off building and made dumb decisions when he finally did his fighting style was weak and unskilled he never even kicked anybody not one single time that saw he was just boxer and not even good one if it wasn for his body armor he would have been dead 100 times over but worst of all he had no idea how to look for clues his only bit of detective work was solving riddles mean mon where did the riddler cards come from the paper the ink the artwork no clues to be found in any of that piss poor detective work such terrible batman get that he was supposed to be just starting out in the gig but this batman was just not intelligent and could never grow up to the be the batman of legend he die first because he is so weak and stupid just like this movie weak insipid and just plain boring except penguin he was good or did say that already1.0\tthe batman was the most accurate batman film ever created focusing on the detective elements that batman is known for with phenomenal cinematography each and every shot is cinematic and precise the chemistry between batman and his allies and his relationships with the characters he interacts with is shown excellently paired with an amazing score and thrilling story non stop edge of your seat action topped off with pattison performance and being the best and most accurate batman to date the opening scene was the best opening scene from any comic book or batman film from start to finish this movie is an exciting action packed thriller and strong 10 100.0\tthink batman movies get automatic praise for being batman movies sometimes this one isn worthy of what it received so far there was no good acting pattinson was likely the best actor in the film but it wasn exactly ground breaking performance kravitz was horrible but very pretty perhaps her parents can buy her some acting lessons to go along with the career they bought her lack luster effects and story line that was just series of things happening one after another that were loosely linked difficult to watch to the finish1.0\tfirst and foremost reeves frasier giacchino and co have crafted gorgeous comic book film but the story lacks heart soul and features structure and pacing issues robert pattinson plays miserable dark and brooding batman with very little bruce wayne kravitz dano farrel wright all bring solid performances the film lacks heart and often feels soulless understand that this is dark gritty take on batman but the film doesn spend much time wanting us to understand the characters within gotham now my main issue with matt reeves batman is the pacing and structure of the film the film starts incredibly well but goes off the rails during the 2nd act and fails to regain the attention of the audience trim some of the fat cut few small subplots and focus on characterisation over aesthetics and the batman would have been near perfect take on dark brooding batman and gotham city0.0\tsoooo where do begin sad boy bruce wayne matt missed the point of batman by mile dark story that lasts too long with so many movie ending parts that somehow never end similar to lotr3 ending story is weak fighting scenes were pretty good pattison as batman is terrible 10 in one moment thought was watching twilight zoe is excellent cat she is beautiful and charismatic and perfect casting 10 10 penguin is unrecognizable great mask good work in bringing the character 10 gordon is 10 wont even say it alfred is 10 please ban mat reeves of making movies and one more batman movie ruined great job1.0\trobert batman just captures the unrotten daddy issues essence and the conflict between discovering himself and saving the city or like recongnizing himself and doing for the greater good just like his dad he wanted the truth this time its given as of selina just wanna praise how amazing her story is unraveled both of their acting just carried the whole film especially for those who might not have watched the previous ones to compare the score just makes me tremble also im so glad saw it in 4d cinema where the whole experienced was enhanced the only flaw is that the whole story involves so much of his dad that the thought of not able to make new stories strangled me just as daddy issues strangles this generation besides rob and zoe has this chemistry no one can pass she is the gay awakening they are the moment1.0\twouldn mind to say would like to see robert pattinson in future batman installments he does justice to the character and obviously brings out the best of the batman there is not much of bruce wayne in the movie which would have been plus point but yes matt wanted detective batman and there nothing missing out of it the music and sound notes are at perfect sync not unnecessarily played at every moment and just when it seems right may have liked better videography photography while recording action scenes good cast selection1.0\tthings liked about the movie dark settings and atmosphere soundtrack the penguin catwoman and how they made it more realistic things didn like the riddler casting not enough action and scenes they could of shorten bit but glad they re trying something different and not making it cheesy like other batman films in the past0.0\twish had fast forward button it was everything but exciting robert patterson did good job but whoever wrote his role needs to rethink their career he spent 5h being dramatic and serious with very few words seems like they did remake off one of the older batmans with more modern scenes it had potential but it was more like kids movie also just don understand how batman is going around just punching people while he has infinite access to gadgets also his car was quite disappointing0.0\tthis movie is dark and gloomy it makes you feel really bad it grimy and unnerving and loud as hell the speaking parts are so low can hear whisper the riddles are so easy young teen sidekick could solve them also there is no batman in this movie just white man dressed in black costume with pointy ears1.0\tcan say enough good things about how the movie portrays batman as character he just like always wanted him to be from the comics specifically those by jeph loeb and frank miller gotham city the crime bosses and the whole atmosphere were perfect fit for super gritty take on batman as an anti hero the movie is not perfect the length is looong and there were some character directing choices didn like but when it comes to mood and cinematography spot on can say rank it higher than 1989 or the dark knight because as story this movie is much less re watchable imo once you know how the mystery is solved don think you get as much enjoyment re watching it whereas 1989 and dark knight are very re watchable still when it comes to the environment the atmosphere the character himself so satisfying highly recommended for batman fans1.0\thours rob pattinson no famous actors playing villain no great expectations yet somehow the trailers left mark the movies lives upto the hype although it long it is incredibly paced it keeps you engaged and guessing only at the climax you feel bit tired but that okay the movie has been narrated from bruce wayne the music gives you feel of darth vader theme the car chase between batman and penguin is amazing truly appreciable content1.0\tdon get me wrong the dark knight is one of the greatest movies of all time but reeves and co have succeeding in telling grounded thrilling detective noir story that honours many of the caped crusaders comic and on screen outings whilst also delivering something new and fresh pattinson kravitz dano wright and farrell provide stellar performance each owning their respective roles and bringing that new look and feel to these well known characters many complaints are about it being too dark and gritty or that pattinson is too broody which perfectly describes what gotham city and batman are all about reeves and co really capture the key elements of batman comic throughout this film and do it with complete justice at times the pacing does feel like it tapers off every now and then however quickly goes back on track once the action kicks in again this is must see for all but multiple sessions kind of movie for those die hard batman and comic fans alike1.0\tvery dark and foreboding sinister even loved every long minute of it was little unsure about the casting of robert pattinson but he was excellent had the quiet brooding persona spot on soundtrack was perfect and added to the errie feeling overall can wait to rewatch1.0\tyou know who batman is matt reeves takes us right into gotham city and doesn take mercy this movie is an experience from beginning to end and not minute of screen time is wasted within the first minutes you know what to expect this is not just quick and easy batman ripoff matt reeves and robert pattinson both know how to play in the shadows and to be lost at sea the soundtrack perfectly encompasses the mood of every scene and the foley team take you inside the bat cave on those dark rainy nights you can hear the flap of every wing and the drip of every raindrop alfred is as dignified as ever keeping bruce tied to reality commissioner gordon can stand his ground and doesn falter under pressure this may not beat spider man at the box office but it definitely tough competition for the awards circuits this is movie you want to see in the highest quality you can1.0\trobert pattinson killed it movie very relevant to our times his portrayal of bruce wayne batman is perfect same goes for zoe kravitz selina kyle1.0\tdid not think after christopher nolan dark knight trilogy that could be blown away by batman movie but this has he is the world greatest detective and for the first time it shows this aspect in great detail as if you were there with him the action was expertly done and the psychological aspect of it brilliant the acting from everyone was spot on the stand out performances were robert pattinson of course who was amazing and colin farrell forgot it was him as the penguin paula dano was perfect as riddler and heir take on him was just perfect0.0\tit was so boring it had like action scenes and most of them were mediocre at best don get why people are so hyped about this bore fest the villain whole plan was stupid no point why is he mad its not clear its just bore fest from beginning to end the acting was really good only bright side of the movie1.0\tthis is the real batman movie proper dark thriller detective action batman movie the best batman movie ever matt reeves outshined christopher nolan in making batman the cast the music the story the screenplay the direction everything was absolutely terrific must watch for all batman fans out there0.0\tgreat expectations ended up in total disaster hours of waiting for the movie to end cannot recommend this movie to anyone lot of the actors need to go back to acting school who can actually allow this to come out on the theaters money seams to rule over good taste1.0\tthe batman is psychological thriller and horror that takes you through the means of what it means to be batman and the problems that come alone with it matt reeves did pretty well with the film giving us excellent look into batman detective skills and showing off some excellent action there isn really moment in this film that won have you invested having just left the theater can assure you most certainly want more the cast played their roles pretty well and the twist and turns in this movie will have everyone second guessing did they really know lot from those amazing trailers am very happy with this film and definitely want more1.0\tthis is great movie ignore the negative reviews from rotten tomatoes as they re either biased or completely ignorant of the fact that this is cinema beautiful art piece and fine detective noir thriller1.0\tgrim dark gloomy and moody with some powerful iconic imagery and dramatic story in an overly gothic setting the story good with plenty of drama and action but without the grand scale of explosive action or tongue in cheek of other superhero movies it is bit hard going at times still the acting performances were great with some good character development and the grittier down to earth style suited the run down and corrupt setting apart from the final act which kept bringing in additional scenes it didn feel long at all1.0\tas fan of the batman this movie was faithful to the comics mostly to year one and was 200 fulfilled matt reeves did an incredible work and all the actors were breathtaking pattinson kravitz farell dano still can believe this film exists1.0\tfor me this was the best batman movie and can say with most certainty that this is the most comic accurate live action batman the dark knight trilogy was amazing and this is masterpiece as well this has to be one of my favourite movies now the action story fighting visuals casting everything is spot on1.0\tsaw the batman last night opening night it had much the same feel as todd phillips joker extremely gritty and depressingly dark and although it masterpiece of movie there no fun runtime of almost hours with some very drawn out scenes especially the two identical footsteps scenes where all you heard was batman heavy boots coming up the hallway for full minute each the costumes all looked homemade no molded rubber nonsense and loved the hand stitched masks for both batman and riddler plus how realistic the wear and tear of his outfit continued to get throughout the film but where is batman gear all of those wonderful toys all he has are grappling hooks some cia spy stuff and souped up dodge challenger in this rendition the acting is all fantastic the mobsters especially farrell the cops everyone robert pattinson plays very dark bruce wayne but his hair is sometimes parted on the left then parted on the right just like the plot of the film definitely worth watching however recommend doing this from the comfort of your home hours without pause button is daunting1.0\tintense dark grim gritty matt reeves and robert pattinson have really made an unique masterpiece scene shoots were so visually aesthetics and well delivered it felt like was watching batman comic on screen and there wasn single moment where was bored or uninterested love it and am so excited for the rest of the trilogy1.0\tthe new batman is phenomenal it gave me goosebumps and the directors and film crew and the legendary actors and actresses robert pattinson and zoe kravits took me on ride into my childhood the memories of my childhood sitting and watching the animated series batman were amazing and so for that just want to thank the director matt reeves and the film crew and the legendary team of phenomenal actors and actresses robert pattinson and zoe kravits and jeffrey wright and paul dano all got the job done and performed phenomenal and absolutely fantastic movie thank you and hope to see sequel in the near future also want to point out that the composer michael giacchino helped with making it great movie with the phenomenal composition hope to see him in the sequel1.0\tboy oh boy was enthralled from the first second to the last it felt like time flying the realism was excellent pattinson hits it out of the park completely reletable brutal and an excellent bruce wayne turturro farrell kravitz wright everyone marvellous dano batman for the ages1.0\tman just glad that watched three hours of robert and not christian bale was so fed up with all these versions of batman portraying him as super pretentious badass immortal smartass guy really don need this much more prefer his humane humble vulnerable just quirky weird side actually think they could have displayed it even more so he is not god after all just good guy with cause and completely understand this type is not for everybody but you have to understand that it not always about the action funny smart lines and cool modern gadgets and usually the one who saves the day and turns out to be hero is actually just weird introverted kid with proper values and emotional depth1.0\thours totally worth it it has great storyline great costume great actors omg love the way catwomen show us catwomen without saying it this is the best batman version ever1.0\tno spoilers here the movie is about how batman tracks vengeful ruthless killer vigilante in himself who targets the corrupt of gotham would certainly place this along with nolan dark knight if not little higher simply because there is heavy substance in this movie heavy thick substance that stares at you that you have see it through to savour the movie what is dark enough for you when you dig deep into your soul and it throws up the mud and dirt that piles up to your neck and then you realize that what you dug out was actually fresh breath of pure life sustaining air that makes you go on and on at vigilanting your city gotham so much they throw at you and you still fend it off and wipe off the muck that has fallen on your face and just simply go ahead with the job my job is gotham city and not wayne legacy have been reading batman comics from my school days in 70s he is my favourite superhero type of superhero who is not in essence super as in other superheros have cherished batman and kept him close to me am not marvel hater am definitely big dc fan this movie brings it out very elegantly we see that in scene in the movie when he has to jump off from great height you can sense the fear in him and the self doubt in him he jumps and lands off clumsily hurting himself gotham is shown in the movie in its true colour the city has soul of it own and which is dark till deep down the city is what it is dank rainy corrupt to the core crime at every corner poverty hopelessness despair crime lords call the shots in the city criminals work part time as the police mental health care is abysmal every government building is failed civic institution it endless supply of sleazy mobsters the dangerous neighbourhood sub alleys this is the first time have seen batman movie showing gotham in its entirety the city screams at you am vengeance am the night yes it is the city screaming at and batman takes it all up and drinks it down to become the vengeance the night and the batman the movie clearly shows that batman has no superpowers he takes up the city on himself in his own volition our crusader is shown to have wee bit of self doubt as he takes it on himself to save the city he has to drain the swirling squalor he has to clean off its sordid grime he has to burn the deadly decay he has to build the city anew shining and new the movie clearly keeps up with this lore daringly made by matt reeves it takes you right back to the time when you were reading the comics robert pattinson does wonderful job not to say the least of the catwoman zoe kravitz and all the others in the movie are living up to exactly what there are portrayed as in the narrative robert pattinson is spectacular in the movie his face his gait his action his dialogue delivery is superb he effuses the vengeance it flows out so subtly from the pall of distraught dissolution that his face expresses they think hiding in the shadows he utters but am the shadows the movie shows him coming out of his own shadow of doubt releasing himself from his self imprisoned room of the past scars and memories1.0\twatched it at the cinema and loved it now purchased it and rewatched it still love it am not going to compare this movie to other dc or marvel movies because think this movie feels different it is more of crime story than superhero story the story unfolds logically which is refreshing to watch considering the length of the movie was not bored for minute which is great achievement liked all the characters they were well casted the chemistry between selina and batman was believable something about this movie is very satisfying to watch it may not be groundbreaking but it sure is entertaining and very rewatchable0.0\tsave your money but most of all time no one can give you back your time fake star for new generation batman is real vampire now critics say wow seem their sentence is cut and full is wow same gibberish again1.0\tloved ever second on it it so moody and dark but the vibe is perfect pattinson is the best batman loved his voiceover at the beginning and end the ending was phenomenal literally some of the best cinematography ve ever seen the way they brought gotham to life with the blood soaked and rain drenched city streets is remarkable marvel needs to catch up1.0\tunique take on the character of batman as thoroughly exhilerating noe noir with great performances amazing action sequences and stunning visuals1.0\tthe batman 2022 dir matt reeves fear is tool the new cinematographic installment of the legendary bat is breath of fresh air and white glove slap at the detractors of the genre more than superhero movie it is film noir with sordid and decadent atmosphere that gives its characters great psychological depth showing the light and shadow that lies within visual aesthetics is not mere artifice here adheres and helps to bring out the tone of the film in gotham city shaken to its foundations by the prevailing corruption in the political and police high command within the narrative there is constant the orphanhood and the damage and indelible consequences that it leaves in the adult stage think all of us who have lost our father in childhood understand and share bruce wayne fear of losing loved one that reality check at an early age makes us understand from young age that nothing is forever the orphanhood links the main characters and it is attractive to see how each one has channeled their respective losses the construction of characters to show us the traumas and fears that lie in their inner world is more relevant here than the use of green screens and action scenes which raises this movie step above mere entertainment pattinson much questioned choice to play the legendary dark knight vanishes when we see the superb performance he gives us minimalist and laconic style that shows us the strengths and vulnerabilities of bruce and his alter ego batman the riddler is villain on par with his nemesis great work by paul dano villain who generates fear and compassion at the same time here the villains are not one dimensional remarkable the bond that forms between batman and catwoman between desire mutual attraction and the gradual discovery that they share the same emotional scars film that even those who do not feel identified with the genre will enjoy1.0\twell the batman is not ten but will give it nine because it excels in so many ways pattinson makes good batman and good bruce wayne zoe kravitz is the best catwoman yet she gorgeous she independent she tough she smart and she has good heart the new penguin is excellent we never get really good look at it but the batmobile is super tough batman rides the bat bike lot which is in keeping with his character even bruce wayne car is really cool guess batman movies now must always be set in dark gothic dystopias it is bit hard to see but the mix between retro gloom and modern technology works very well like that batman carries the batarang on his chest the climax is bit confused and poorly edited other than that am very satisfied and hope we will be seeing more of all of the cast1.0\tin my opinion this is the best batman movie ever seen after the heath ledger dark knight movie if it not on the same level loved the movie it very mysterious all the way and focuses on detective batman which is very different from the other batman movies recommend it to everyone to watch it worth the money1.0\tlove this movie and if being perfectly honest don think any other movie coming out this year will top it it is mature realistic take on batman and it works so well and robert pattinson was phenomenal and was worried that he would ruin the movie but he didn the riddler was an incredible villain and some of the things he does in this movie genuinely made me feel anxious for the characters so overall this movie was incredible and might watch it in the cinema again loved this movie to death so if you re batman fan highly recommend you watch this movie in the cinema or if you cannot get the 4k blu ray when it releases0.0\tthis is movie that delves into batmans past and features conflict between batman and the riddler enjoyed many parts of this movie it has awesome action scenes and plot development the movie is let down by long scenes with boring dialogue an hour of this movie could have been cut simply by removing some of these scenes would recommend it to anyone who likes comic books and marvel films however in my opinion none will ever be as good as the dark knight1.0\tmatt reeves and robert pattinson bring one of the best portrayal of batman on screen with pattinson stunningly shines in his portrayal of the dark knight must watch movie1.0\tfear bruce wayne tells us in gloomy voiceover early in the batman is tool he talking about how the presence of the batman can be used to intimidate bad guys but it also possible writer director matt reeves took this to heart for his approach to rebooting the famous superhero this is the scariest batman yet right from the violent opening scene the message is clear this is not your mother caped crusader this is creeping angry white knuckle inducing psychological thriller with heavy dose of crime noir and believe it or not reeves absolutely pulls it off achieving grimly beautiful masterpiece1.0\tfantastic movie great acting great pacing and an outstanding performance by colin farrell this movie is dark and gritty without being depressive and gives you good look into gotham city the riddler is creepier and more in depth that previous versions having an actual purpose in the movie this movie plays into classic criminal psycho stereotype in great way with enough twists to keep you interested can bring up colin farrells performance enough almost impossible to know it was him full character was formed with penguin that the actor disappeared entirely finally robert pattinson plays more shy and eager to grow version of batman with so much to look forward to couldn recommend it enough1.0\tve never been into comics nor that interested in the marvel or dc universe but thought give the batman movie try after seeing the previews and there wasn much else on and loved it was so impressed with this movie it quite dark and gritty this is not movie for kids and even though it has long run time was never bored for moment and the story really drew me in it actually really beautiful movie may even be converted1.0\tthe batman holds due to its claim of originality hosting an enjoyable experience through truely unique and grounded film while relying heavily on utilising the noir genre to its advantage it does so in splendid fashion1.0\tbasically you have christopher nolan level of reality of batman but telling comic book story you get to see the mind of the detective and not just the bat say this is somewhat of buddy cop movie meets action thriller the only reason you could throw in the category of superhero movie is because he wears cape my only real issue comes from this film bruce wayne pattinson is playing him like he still working on the set of twilight0.0\twould happily sue wb for the hours of my life back this includes the time queued for popcorn some excellent performances from several members of the cast however could have quite happily fallen asleep during several scenes from this film and still missed nothing there are many wasted opportunities for plot advancement and several places where the laws of physics were blithely ignored for an opportunity to advance the cinematics that were quite frankly waste of time effort and money that wb were happily shovelling into firepit there have been lessons learned from batman vs superman however not nearly enough in this film that was very clearly hour far too long the plot raced like tortoise on valium notable performances from mr patterson and mr farrell who managed to salvage some credibility from script that was filled with unnecessary length even after being cut by an hour ms kravitz unfortunately gave performance where her only understanding of life growing up in brothel was via an online dictionary supporting cast gave excellent performances given the extremely lacklustre script that somehow was greenlit while several executives of warner were drunk at downtown strip club wb should sit down and be forced to watch the entire mcu with eyes held open with steel braces and eye drops applied the mcu has pace very much perfected the drivel that wb have produced in the last 10 years has done nothing for cinema other than to gently massage the fact that they negotiated great deal with dc many years ago and have been producing absolute drivel as contractual agreement otherwise the license would revert back to dc to put out to much better pasture my 10 is generous the film was only saved by performances from several professional actors who understood their art verdict may call the fire brigade however would definitely not urinate in the general vicinity of this film if the blaze was in danger of setting off wmd 101.0\tit is probably the best batman movie of this decade and the previous the writing and direction is sublime and all the actors play coherent role in this movie great background score and visual effects truly great movie0.0\tthis isn batman the starts is for an interesting concept but the film is too long and way too overhyped and overrated just don get it the films weak as is the fighting there no flow to it makes me wonder do the writers even read the comics how hard is it to just throw him in the middle of story and make it good detective movie with decent amount of good fights batflek0.0\tcorny antifa reject villians they coin madeup communist terms like white privledge to decribe white people this was very long deceptive poltical piece deguised as batman movie batman was wayyy to weak and full of teenager angst1.0\tthe batman is nothing short of incredible matt reeves had such an ambitious vision for it and truly delivered the perfect batman movie am genuinely overwhelmed by how good this was it was everything wanted it to be and more literally cannot put it into words what this movie was its so different than anything we have gotten from comic book movie before and makes so many bold decisions that really pay off it wonderfully dark and grim embracing somber noir tone and it worked so well for the story the film is also super comics accurate many scenes jump right off the pages of the comics and show new perspective of batman that we haven seen on screen before it even felt reminiscent of the arkham knight games it staggering achievement and am so happy that wb allowed matt reeves to fully realize his vision was blown away by what reeves was able to do matt reeves is the true star of this film say what you will but he may be one of the best directors to ever get his hands on the batman ip and saying this as someone who loves christopher nolan and the dark knight trilogy and to clear up the question of is it better than the dark knight have to say feel that both these movies are on the same level for me they re both very different and have merits in their own ways but yes really did love this one you can very much tell that reeves poured his heart and soul into this and had such strong sense of what he wanted to creatively achieve with this film not only does it have very impressive script that really understands and unpacks many elements of the batman character and world but reeves brings it to life in such an interesting and stylish way it essentially flawless film masterpiece by reeves he was firing on all cylinders so brilliantly subverts the expectations of an origin story with brooding and bleak noir film that completely reinvigorates the batman story also loved that he seemed to embrace some of david fincher styles and techniques the film is grim gritty and gripping loved the mystery and thriller focus and the fact we finally got to see the detective side of batman in movie was so exciting and satisfying it something we ve never seen before and worked so well the film is very reminiscent of films like se7en and chinatown the dark noir like tone is perfect wouldn even call it an action movie but when we do get the action scenes holy do they ever pack punch they are guttural visceral and violent you can feel the intensity of every punch even the car chase scene between penguin and batman was insanely cool its one of the most thrilling car chases ve ever seen and can just say the reveal and design of the batmobile in the film was so exciting and cool and the sound design sold it so well the atmosphere of the film was excellently established and loved the darkness of it huge part of this was the stunning cinematography by greig fraser who is quickly becoming one of my favourite cinematographers every single shot in this film seems to tell story its such visually interesting and stylistic piece of cinema there is such strong visual aesthetic from the colours used to the excellent use of lighting or lack thereof and shadows there were so many shots where stared at the screen in awe of what was watching especially love the one in the dark tunnel only lit by the gun fire and other flashing lights as we see batman swiftly destroy team of guards or the shots on the rooftop of the gcpd with the perfect orange lighting the visual effects were also spectacular to the point honestly didn even notice if there were any or not which is the goal one of the other elements that absolutely loved was michael giacchino score the theme alone is incredible and one that think will go down in history as an iconic film theme but when you see it paired with the visuals and the story it works insanely well couldn believe how breathtaking the entire score was and how it electrified the film it easily one of my favourites from giacchino its unlike anything he done before its dark brooding yet beautiful and filled with intensity he truly is one of modern film best composers sound was just used spectacularly in this film not just with the score but with the overall mix too from the sounds of the suit and batman footsteps really making you feel the weight of the suit to the excellent sound design of the batmobile this movie cast was stunningly perfect had my doubts about few going in but my god every single performance in this movie blew me away the acting was superlative robert pattinson is awesome as batman and have to say he is probably my favourite actor to ever play this iconic character he killed it he exudes power and intensity and feels somewhat unhinged liked the take on younger batman and especially when it comes to his bruce wayne persona you could really see how truly broken he is this is damaged character and pattinson sold that so well he felt somewhat untethered from humanity someone who is watching from the sidelines and so desperately wants to rejoin but can seem to keep his own life together loved this fresh take on the character and how much pattinson committed to the role seeing him in the suit he seemed so ferocious and imposing and he handled both the action and emotion so well it was truly first rate performance zoë kravitz was someone who also really surprised me didn have high hopes for her going in but after seeing it she truly became the best iteration of catwoman to ever be on the big screen especially loved her dynamics with pattinson and the chemistry they had they really sold the tension between their characters so well another dynamic loved was the one between jeffrey wright gordon and batman they truly felt like partners here and loved that because the other movies always say they are but this was the first time we got to see them truly working together loved that they had their own lingo and seemed to be quite close it worked so well and was one of my favourite parts of the film and while all these actors did an incredible job it was paul dano that truly stole the show for me he is terrifying and compelling as riddler genuinely couldn take my eyes off him when he was onscreen loved the fresh take on riddler swapping out the goofy persona for more serious threatening serial killer type he quickly became my second favourite batman villain after heath ledger joker and can even put into words how unbelievable dano was he is electric love how deranged and unsettling he can be absolutely highlight for me colin farrell was pretty good as oz penguin too but the true focus of his performance was how unrecognizable he was because of the excellent makeup and accent he does andy serkis even surprised me as alfred love this new version this was some bold storytelling too love that it took risks and went in more unique interesting direction loved how it established this version of batman and gotham really rooting them in realistic setting and really made gotham itself feel like character in the movie it was brilliantly written had some awesome mystery elements and so many complex pieces to the plot loved the more vicious batman we see as well as the more damaged bruce wayne my only problem is we didn really get enough of the bruce wayne persona but trust me the batman stuff is done so perfectly it makes up for it the 1st and 2nd acts were masterful but felt the 3rd act was slightly weaker in some of its more softer reveals that being said still loved so many things about the 3rd act especially lot of bold choices that were made the movie as whole is just flat out incredible the hours truly fly by its excellently paced and has so much going on the batman is easily one of the best comic book movies ever made and is perfect batman movie it felt like eating full meal it was incredibly satisfying to watch and loved the fresh dark take on the material it has high rewatchability factor after seeing it for the second time it only got better this was exactly what it needed to be and love what this sets up for the future the batman is in good hands with reeves and pattinson if this film was masterpiece which it was can wait to see what they have in store for the future recognize this film may not be for everyone but for one absolutely and wholeheartedly loved it it perhaps one of my new favourite films1.0\tone of the best movie of all time fantastic perfect dark deep brilliant mysterious great didn expect it to be that good like it very very much became to be moody when choose anything1.0\tto start with the casting director lucy bevan nailed it it been while since ve seen box office movie hit so sweet in it core side and background characters colin farrell steals the screen as the penguin paul dano as the riddler is creepy and new tot eh game and catwoman gets back to her caring comic roots and to the bewilderment of some and understandable talent to others robert pattinson expertly pulls off complex array of characters that clearly show his prowess as actor and also his vabrato as the caped crusader himself another beautifully shot film from dp greig frasier who also shot dune this time things get dark in psychological thriller truly engaging it uncanny how literally every scene plays into the next my adhd was very happy with this one shot after shot was blown away however the special treat and it must be mentioned is the score from michael giacchino personally not super fan of his music think he has difficulty with character themes instead opting for unique interplay with individual scenes he does great job but this film is my favorite from him since incredibles in 2008 catwoman batman and riddler themes are vastly different and some of his best motifs ever his score makes the scenes what they are dark gritty surreal city landscapes this film is definitely on par with the dark knight for sure and will be remembered as fantastic edition to character that only gets better the more he is expanded upon well1.0\tits not your typical superhero film days are not gloomy and there is no cliche heroic scenes where everything turns out exactly how the hero wants its dark horror and broken take on hero that is still discovering how he needs to make an impact acting direction storytelling cinematography were all topnotch music score could ve been done better its not bad but it could ve been better overall its must watch film0.0\tzero charisma dialogues bordering on nothingness ridiculous puns only catwoman comes out of the game little rate that more than it cheating1.0\tan astonishing film of all sizes showing gotham city as it should appear and moving the world into an infinitely dark universe along with the batman detective character in its early days it based on the spirit of the long halloween and batman detective comics1.0\tit started out very good the first half set up the movie for an excellent climax but it just didn come and didn like the bit of politics that was involved too but other than that it was nice experience didn feel like it was hours long moody soundtrack with some dark visuals was just what the movie needed pattinson was good but felt like he could have been given some more scenes or some more action cause felt like he didn make much of an impact but hey he young batman so it understandable not sure what the fuss about with the cat women she didn feel very convincing but it was alright loved commissioner gordon he owned that character also paul dano was good too whole movie was nostalgic experience brought me back to my childhood watching batman the animation series good times1.0\tstill can get over with this masterpiece vengeance robert pattinson as batman is so cool and the dark theme and bgm 10 10 yes it little bit slow burn but as true batman fan can adjust with that0.0\tdc should ve just allowed ben affleck to use his script the actor they had playing batman looked more like he would ve been better suited to play night wing alongside ben affleck as batman1.0\tmatt reeves when this film maker came on board to make the batman following affleck leaving the project no one would have expected that he could make film that would be so good that no one would even question the film maker it not flawless because that title still remains with the dark knight but it the batman film you have wanted to see all your life and surely when the sequel comes believe the dark knight will have competitor which can beat it easily reeves casting was great and that can be seen in the film but the cinematography was flawless it one of the reasons this film should be included in the oscars1.0\twent in thinking that this batman would not beat christopher nolan trilogy and was right but this comes as close second with this film taking different angle as more detective esque feel to it coupled with the couple more nuggets of details that helps to enrich one who only watches the films and not read the comics watch the cartoons knowledge in this universe it definitely brings fresh take of batman unlike any other definitely worth watch0.0\tso bizarre and dumb to go back in time nobody wants to see old boring tech ben affleck ruined every potential dc sequel because he an alcoholic and all around unreliable douche they should ve stuck with christian bale who was clearly the best batman of all1.0\tthis movie couldn bind me to go with its flow it was long boring stretchy story was like old school not effectiveness batman was really made poor by attaching afterburner to chevy model lol about the lights it was really dark forgot to bring my torch it was more of like detective rather to watch sherlock holmes overall it was ok1.0\tbatman fight ribbler super scary woooo also do not like batman so if say that this movie is good even with batman in it that means it really really super good1.0\trobert pattinson does wonderful job portraying bruce wayne and his identity love the mystery aspect and unexpected psychological thrills the movie was bit long but the directing was unreal1.0\tit felt amazing to watch the batman in packed theater opening night especially after being hyped up for it for months it truly met my expectations which is so refreshing for big movies coming out these days so many incredibly composed shots matt reeves is easily becoming favorite director of mine his attention to detail is so palpable and exquisite the video game quality to the story beats and fight choreography obviously felt earned and made this hours long epic the absolute most fun it could possibly be special commendation needs to be given to the score of this film so beyond exceptional the batman theme sticks with you and by the third time it played in the movie feel like can hop in the conductors chair myself but know can because michael giacchino is legend clearly he loves either the batman character or this script which do too because there was no need to go this hard but so glad he did second special shoutout goes to the cinematography matt reeves let me in 2017 was definitely good movie to watch prior to this to get feel for his visual storytelling style because it is so rich and colorful and visionary simply so much of the movie is defined by the colors or the atmosphere created by how spectacularly acted this film is robert pattinson and zoe kravitz and jeffery wright and colin firth and john tutero and every single other cast member deserve sag award at the minimum for how well this ensemble operates to sum the screenplay cinematography editing score visual effects and costume design are absolutely oscar worthy and it manages to be satisfying popcorn flick while its at it the cinematography and score of the batman steal the show in an already incredible movie would rewatch in millisecond1.0\tloved gotham city loved the cinematography loved every single minutes of watching this movie actors such as colin farrell zoe kravitz stole the show the villain was amazing and it probably paul danos best work also jeffrey wrights was great jim gordon the sadness in andy serkis eyes andy serkis was great alfred 10 10 if you like batman you ll love this movie1.0\teverything about this movie was absolutely fantastic to the storyline acting cinematography and more it surpassed my exportations the soundtracks were amazing can easily say that this is the best batman movie ive seen good job dc you re back1.0\tthis is not only the best batman film ever made it is landmark in amazing comic book movies masterwork of cinematography and writing the batman is brilliant mix of action and mystery that keeps audiences engaged for every minute of its runtime all brought together by stunning visuals and amazing costume work that is sure to give you breath of fresh air from the over cgi fights dominating the box office robert pattison plays the best bruce wayne ever shown on screen he is perfect example of batman as character his detective skills are on full display as he shows us batman who more than slab of meat to punch the colorful villains if there is one complaint to be levied against this film it is the riddler while is plot is intelligent and cunning his onscreen performance falls victim to the over the top insane villain trope that plauges many comic book villains his bouts of yelling and extending every syllable of word when angry undercuts his genuine show of intelligence this is outdone however by the rest of the casts perfect performances james gordon is potrayed as intelligent and kind true partner to batman in every way the penguin is delightfully hammy and threatening joy for every second of screentime and zoe kravitz plays the best catwoman thats ever been on the big screen though her competition wasnt great to begin with the plot is beautiful mystery that perfectly balances its way through showing the audience enough and not overplaying its hand and its understanding of bruce wayne as character cannot be overstated every shot and scene is carefully crafted with the perfect lighting and sound this movie can truly be described as visual masterpiece it is not only inevitable that there will be sequel it would be crime to not let this cast continue their amazing work1.0\twho thought really another batman movie how many ways can the same story be told and how can anyone ask an audience to sit for hrs still have to say it was all worthwhile know there are lot of reviews and don expect to add anything in way of information so just here to say thanks to the makers of this unbelievably good movie wow just went through lot of reviews and felt it necessary to come back to write this addendum it would seem that anything under rating was written by frustrated no life pack red bull drinkers questioning whether the reviewers who thought this film is excellent are real and it would also seem like they wrote multiple reviews with original titles like why or why just why or bored over and over having hard time figuring out what these kids want it was long agree with that but what would you rather have one long movie or part one and part two think these kids live to criticize makes them feel like they have something to say in their otherwise empty lives maybe some of you will get life someday1.0\tit was very refreshing to see batman movie go all the way with mystery thriller to showcase batman detective skills also very refreshing to see the comic storyline of batman hush style come to big screen as gathered from the trailers before going in also loved how they incorporated the use of random bat tech and gadgets to give us insight of random things his utility belt has does really good at painting batman in his early days1.0\tjust going to get straight to the point loved it but nearly fell asleep as 42yr old that is passionate about film have seen hundreds of films in the cinema many of which that have been far worse than this movie but until now have never once nearly fell asleep found that the style of voice acting along with the red orange black colour palette and the soundtrack so extremely relaxing to the point of it being almost hypnotic so much so that found myself very nearly falling asleep on numerous occasions if was at home watching the batman led on my sofa have no doubt that would have dozed off multiple times an experience ve never had especially with such quality production1.0\tthe only thing the riddler looks like nerd kid good acting just didn look the same age as bruce which guess they were going for otherwise really good1.0\tso brutal and amazing had to go see it twice and don even like superhero movies but this one was done exactly how batman should have been portrayed dark and depressive it was all so beautiful from the villains doing an astronomical job to robert pattinson completely destroying every single batman before him this is definitely must watch even if you don like superhero type of movies the only complaint have is taking away footage so it wouldn maintain the rating want the most raw batman movie out there can wait for the sequel from matt reeves honestly super impressed how he made hour movie of pure chaos and destruction and make it look so cinematically beautiful 10 101.0\tits hard to be original when there has been so many different variations of character already but this movie nails it its dark gritty hard hitting and will keep you intensely guessing throughout every character is fresh and different take on the characters that you are already familiar with all have character tweaks from previous iterations and all of them just work pattinsons batman is more reclusive and gothic but harder hitting than others before him he swings to the extreme side of comfort behind the mask and looks uncomfortable as his playboy persona in the real world the new dynamic is fascinating batman needed to move on from afflecks batman fast and succeed feel for affleck the scripts handed to him were woeful cant wait for the next movies1.0\tprobably the best cinema of this decade this is what real cinema is cinematography and story line was amazing robbert pattinson gonna be one of my favourite batsy0.0\tthe casting is great all actors did great job and looked great that said this looked like videogame storyline where the guy goes from checkpoint to checkpoint gathering clues the romantic scenes looked like perfume ad so that tells you how direction was really on the nose when it comes to tone no meaningful character development just plot exposition and in batman universe everything has been done before so this story really felt like it was told before million times and this version did not have any meaningful twist that could carry movie think this is the first batman film that does this so this is just boring mediocre film about weird rich dude that is learning to use his weird gadgets while getting in the way of public servants like the police or the fire department for batman fans think there is better fan fiction or videogames out there rank this way down the list of batman movies before batman and robin after batman forever jim carrey fun not hours long1.0\tyes it is what batman movie needs to be dark gritty sometimes scary suspenseful top notch acting thrilling action beautiful cinematography and that breathtaking score it all awesome1.0\tll keep this short and sweet this is great detective noir movie that harkens back to the 70s films of that genre more than traditional comic book film both more grounded and real but also more fantastical then the dark knight trilogy heads up this movie is not for everyone this is slow burn movie and unless you pay attention you may get lost there is some humor but it is mostly dark humor so if it is not your thing this is your heads up1.0\tthis batman movie shows side of batman we ve never seen before the detective side of batman is very well portrayed in this movie the cinematography and combat were also amazing felt like was playing batman arkham game only con was the length of the movie as it did feel bit long overall one of the best comic book movies of all time and look forward to more matt reeves batman films amazing1.0\twell this review is going to be an unpopular opinion but in all honesty really wasn blown away by this the 1260th version of batman lolz first off when saw robert pattinson was cast in the lead was already sceptical after broody and better forgotten turn in twilight was hoping he would fare better sadly found he was still broody hollow maybe it just personal thing as for the plot found it intriguing yet often confusing and would definitely shave off at least half an hour off the running time that said it was still trilling in places particularly towards the end for me the best part of this film is the score with although maybe too repeated but still some very dark booming tones reminiscent of the imperial march from star wars lastly the rest of the cast were good but still not spectacular and the penguin didn like at all where was his limp so overall although did like this movie it is far from the worst batman for me the dark knight trilogy is still leaps bounds ahead of this and imo the gotham tv show still has the best character portrayals of any batman interpretation to date1.0\tfirst of all bravo matt reeves he directed wonderful good looking movie there were so many beautiful shots in this the acting in this movie was chef kiss not one character felt bad this bruce wayne is different than we re used to but really liked it it not an action movie it mystery drama good slow burn and it didn get boring at all this movie reminded me lot of david fincher se7en of course there are little nitpicks nothing is perfect wish we saw paul dano little bit more in this don expect big final fight in the end but giving it for now this is not perfect comic book movie it perfect batman movie0.0\tcan believe have waisted three hours watching this film boring poor acting no connection no excitement no action no jokes if you are batman fan don watch this one1.0\tnow this is batman without having to do another tired flashback scene to bruce hero or villain origin story we get to see the early days of the bat as he struggles with his identity as vigilante and millionaire this film had many feels sometimes horror sometimes buddy cop film but it didn feel disjointed it had three complete sections the way story should the acting was incredible from the cast and most importantly they depicted the psychology of bruce wayne as batman in an original entertaining way the three hour run time worried me at first but they maintained the pace and the movie flew by loved this movie and rob makes one of the swaggiest heroes yet1.0\tthe batman movie is giving us new experience we have lots of dictetive and dark type batman comics and animations but we have not this type in live action now the dark dictetive type batman came in to the live action movie called the batman so don miss the new experience1.0\teverything about the movie was just perfect the cinematography had me drooling the camera angles were consistently astonishing through the movie the fight scenes were one of kind the story helped us experience broken ruthless batman in city that might just be beyond saving definitely recommend this to anyone what film genuinely can wait for the next one0.0\tyes it that bad and if you re going to leave demand ticket refund that the only way an audience can fight back against whollyweird this excremental exhibition of bad writing acting and effects has nothing in common with the comic book batman batmanuel is better batman than this drecklich peacemaker is better batman camina drummer is better batman1.0\tpeople who hate this movie are either snyder shills or don know nothing about quality cinema got me confused if its better than the dark knight tho its extremely unique and psychological its masterpiece0.0\twho the angst ridden posing floppy haired sap in the cape because it sure isn batman what were they trying to do here the whole film almost hours of it is mushy childlike over simplified nonsense the only recognizable character is gordon and he looked embarrassed to be there more emphasis is placed on batman being rogue detective as opposed to the superhero of the dark knight series but he is spoon fed the easiest questions since adam had to pick what he likes in woman it all art house show and no substance gotham just felt fake and empty as if some hollywood lovies had taken it over to shoot film0.0\tgood pattinson was good as batman batmobile roar was cool but that about it bad super slow movie another one of those sad gloomy dark movies from dc at least people in my row fell asleep including me lol it worked for joker but not here overall fun less movie wanted to get out mid way to complete it later on streaming service but my friend wanted to sit through this painful saga0.0\thave seen bad movies but this one just passed all worst benchmarks this movie is like all over the place and you don even get anything out of it after spending all your time and you are forced to leave the theatre before the move even finishes1.0\tseen yesterday very well done different batman than usual very dark very dark really liked this dress which in my opinion creates new and never seen face of this character pattinson passed with flying colors impeccable scenography image and soundtrack at the height of nolan trilogy excellent texture although long lasting yarn then on the sofa at home won weigh it like that anymore overall 10 must see1.0\twhat film this was isn your ordinary batman or superhero film it unique the story the actors the way the film is shot it was great and pattison is very class batman honestly can wait to see what they have planned next and oh yeah riddler wow what very disturbing bad guy1.0\tfully comics based all characters are well explained yu can feel the vibes of the dark knight storyline mostly from batman year one and comics robert pattinson just in top best batman of all time1.0\tif you like basic superhero movie plots and dislike long intricate story then this movie isn for you the good there were lot of good things about this movie the cinematography was great the camera angles were very very varied and the production value was very good in general concerning costumes and effects robert patterson did great job as dark brooding batman ve always envisioned bruce wayne to be more dark and broody than he has been portrayed he witnessed his parents get murdered and he just kind of shrugs it off like nothing happened in most of the batman movies also so glad they didn show the waynes being killed again all the other characters were well casted and fit their roles perfectly robert patterson and zoe kravitz had great chemistry the story itself was very long but it was intricate and it wasn just your basic superhero story there were surprises and it seemed more like detective movie than batman movie they did good job of spacing out the boring parts into very small segments the bad at times it could drag little bit but not enough to make me doze off it is more of detective story like said so there will be instances in which they are literally just following up on leads and trying to figure it out the run time is bit much and they could have definitely ended the film 15 minutes before they did the ugly the penguin ugly mug lol1.0\tmasterpiece of cinema not just superhero movie great detective movie with elements of horror great acting and amazing score would get 10 if it wasn for one predictible phrase by catwoman go watch it everyone deserves to be seen on the big screen1.0\tquite honestly one of the best movies ve seen for years love the noir settings the opening scene the batmobile reveal all of it robert pattinson did himself proud such great film from everyone involved1.0\tmayor don mitchell jr is killed in his own home by an intruder at the crime scene the killer has riddle specifically for batman with clue about his murder the world greatest detective must solve the riddles and find clues to the identity of the killer as he uncovers photo which has picture of mitchell and woman he was with at the iceberg lounge he comes across selina kyle who he gets to go in to have her find clues about the case and about some potential corruption the best way to describe the batman is that it is crime drama about detective searching for clues and solving riddles to catch crazy serial killer disguised as comic book movie despite this film being about batman the script treats him like great detective and not just superhero the other batman films do this as well to varying degrees but this film goes the hardest on the grimy bleak atmosphere of gotham not only are the criminals scumbags but the politicians and figures of authority have some dirty secrets as well this movie presents gotham city at its absolute worst and loved nearly every minute of it for me this is the kind of batman film that would love to see more often the film is so tense and it always feels like there is rush to find the riddler because you never know when he will strike next and who he will kill the film shows more humane side the wayne family which makes bruce past much more prominent to the story the opening sequence with batman narration alone had me hooked because it establishes the kind of character he is just from that opening scene knew was in for something special matt reeves is director who knows how to make film serious and dark without being too outright bleak even though this is pretty bleak film it is not outright hopeless there are moments of hope and humor to show that gotham can be rebuild for movie that packed in as much as possible the script nails nearly every aspect from batman story about vengeance to catwoman rage and independence to the riddler systematic targeting of the people in power at gotham what made this batman truly work for me is the cast this is without doubt one of the best casts of any comic book film have ever seen both on paper and in practice robert pattinson is unrecognizable as bruce wayne he gives perspective of the millionaire that is lot more vulnerable and broken as batman he is brutal in combat and brilliant with his detective skills the movie allows pattinson to show how batman operates at crime scenes and how he progresses in cases like this this movie shows why batman is considered the world greatest detective also this is minor but his voice is perfect he is the most terrifying batman to date because he gives the most frightening looks and this take on batman is bit more vengeful and violent it is early but pattinson may just be my favorite live action version of batman cannot say anything wrong about his performance as the caped crusader then there is paul dano as the riddler going into this film was worried that the riddler could end up acting like the joker after this movie have to say that this version of the riddler is one of the best villains in batman film he is such creep with how he taunts batman and how he writes to him yet he always manages to stay one step ahead of him his presence and actions feel like something out of horror film at times can see how the riddler characterization was inspired by the zodiac killer with his taunting both from the letters and the calls paul dano is creepy yet calm which keeps him from acting like the joker any time he is on screen or if he even has any presence he steals the show this is the batman villain that absolutely terrifies me especially by the climax for the rest of the cast their amazing too zoë kravitz is fantastic as an anti heroic catwoman she has all of the right movements for the character and she shares great romantic chemistry with pattinson she is also very sympathetic in this movie as you will feel bad for her during the film jeffrey wright makes for great and supportive commissioner gordon his friendship with batman is surprisingly heartwarming colin farrell plays as the penguin and he is also unrecognizable he even provides some much needed comic relief in one really dark film farrell delivers an amazing performance andy serkis is really good alfred and john turturro is menacing as falcone could go on for hours about how amazing this cast is because there is not bad performance in this movie as for the production values they are superb as well this movie has such an ambitious visual style while the other batman films present gotham as dark and brooding city this movie goes the extra mile it has very dim lighting in lot of areas with gunfire being the only source of light in one action scene there is also lot of red indicating that gotham is dangerous for anyone not just normal citizens it visual style feels like movie from new hollywood but with modern visuals and cameras the cinematography has some amazing shots like batman scaling down building with the camera switching the angle that was breathtaking shot the costumes and makeup are fantastic as both pattinson and farrell are barely recognizable in their roles the sets look like something from the batman arkham video game series and love it the movie looks stunning not every shot works as there few moments where the lighting is bit too dark but when it works it freaking works the movie has some great batman action scenes as well here batman is destroying goons both physically and mentally the fights are beautifully shot and edited and they are absolutely brutal they also utilize batman strengths and gadgets the best scene however is the batman and penguin chase scene that is how chase scene is done it is intense and it gets more intense every moment the action in this film show batman at his most violent and unforgiving of course the soundtrack is amazing michael giacchino gives the batman an amazing theme and there is song here that fits the tone of the movie perfectly while the batman is very long film there is not whole lot would take out if anything at all it shows why good movie is never too long the batman is fantastic crime thriller that is masked as superhero film this movie has my favorite version of batman to date and it has some of the best storytelling and atmosphere building for the caped crusader after the dark knight trilogy the old batman films in the 80s and 90s and the dceu films from snyder did not know if new live action batman film could offer something fresh for the character was wrong dead wrong really hope we see pattinson again maybe have him face mr freeze and deal with humanitarian ferris boyle would love to see something like that highly recommend this movie especially if you are batman fan just prepare yourself if you go see this in theaters it is very long movie1.0\treally amazing movie lots of action and detailed characters no boring scenes that feel they take forever and very interesting villains definitely recommend1.0\tafter all the waiting and the hype and after having an awesome christopher nolan trilogy was preparing myself to be disappointed by this movie my expectations were so high and right now going to see this movie for second time this is labour of love for the character and cinematography there are great scenes and the introduction scenes of the batman were great focusing on those dark alleyways or door openings could feel my own tension rising in anticipation and when he finally comes well oomph it hits all the right markers lot of attention has been given to scenes without speech sound effects are terrific like when he starts up the batmobile genuinely love the fact they focused lot on the detective part of dc detective comics this batman is not superhero he guy wanting to do difference by using everything he can his deductive mind and iq first it does give us very different bruce wayne but then again more true to some of the comics out there this worked really well this is labour of love and loved it for being that thank you for making this one1.0\tin my opinion this movie is not only the best film adaptation of batman but it is also one of if not the best superhero movie ever made if you re batman fan recommend you watch and enjoy this masterpiece0.0\tcan believe set three hours watching this movie this movie could ve easily been two hours long if batman walked little bit faster instead of doing the creeper walk this is not the batman we want or need the whole movie just doesn make sense in my opinion1.0\tif you are into old photography adult stuff movies that you deliver more realistic and raw atmosphere this movie is for you this is definitely the best batman1.0\twent to see this without any expectations and very sceptic regarding the choice of robert pattinson as the caped crusader just glad went to see this last night with my kid finally comeback to batman true dark origins can honestly say this is on par with tim burton batman but in more serious tone the start of the movie was brilliant batman first appearance was epic to say the least robert pattinson is batman one of the best performances of the caped crusader together with zoë kravitz sensual and perfect catwoman colin farrel is irrecognizable as oz and torturo and serkis roles were great to say the least this movie is dark as good old batman comic should be batman is tall scary agile resourceful and strong the fear factor worked perfectly since the beginning the sountrack opening with nirvana epic something in the way was perfect setting the dark tone overall with very well built music and strong sound effects the car chase scene was the weakest point with far too many close ups and left me struggling to understand what was going on and how the batmobile looked like there something very deep in this movie something far beyond the action something very intimate deadly and dangerous touching the edges of lunacy and how people with issues can differ on life choices for the good and bad it left me wanting more but at the same time pleasantly satisfied what masterpiece dc did everything right with this one or almost and makes me wonder how marvel disney cant learn from this school of cinema because they are being teached lesson how proper hero movie should be1.0\tthis movie was so dark and grimy it was the best interpretation of living in gotham of all the batman movies each major character played their role to perfection with the standout role of colin farrell as penguin my only comparison is the video games of the arkham series and the movie the joker if this is the direction dc is going all in0.0\treboot of remake of spin off when you want to be bigger nolan than nolan himself hollywood is falling apart movie is too naive woke long boring bla bla1.0\tas have watched batman got reminded of the all time blockbuster dark knight trilogy of christopher nolan how it created impact on the superhero fan base of dc marvel but in the pop culture of the world as well after this franchise many were wondering how the batman and joker will be re introduced by the new actors and directors in the cinema as the legacy left by christopher nolan christian bale heath ledger and others was hard to forget joker character played by actor jared leto was subject of mockery in suicide squad but it finally got justice by actor joaquin phoenix playing the clown prince of gotham in the movie joker which became blockbuster then batman got reintroduced as actor ben affleck played the character in bvs and justice league it was good but not enough to be compared with the previous ones now twilight actor robert pattinson has stepped into the shoes and director matt reeves trying to try out his hand in superhero movie people were making fun of him but can say he has proved all of them wrong director reeves have also proved his metal just like his previous dawn of the ape franchise movies all others have done there job good as well apart from acting the two other elements which think made this movie interesting were firstly different take on the batman they have tried to explore more of batman detective side and introduction of new villian riddler played superbly by actor paul dano made this movie good and the second one is micheal giachhino bgm and piano score which really adds weight to the scenes overall great movie0.0\tslow and predictable wait to see it at home tech was sub par even for even val kilmer batman over blown week action scenes don get me wrong the cast was quality just poor writing and directing quality your better off watching the gotham series hour of my life can please get refund1.0\tit was far more better than expected everything went perfect and robert pattinson did very good job not only him the others too the casting was really fantastic we can see very different outlook of both bruce wayne and batman in here the real detective side of batman is used in the plot and it is more like crime thriller genre the plot was kinda dark and scary and some of the scenes really gave goosebumps especially the one with batmobile in which batman chases the penguin the background music was top notch and it was perfectly blended with the movie the only sad part us that they removed the jocker scene from the movie it is must watch if you are batman fan or super hero movie fan or crime thriller fanatic don think again go and watch it0.0\twas quite disappointed in this work it was not as expected the acting is acceptable the batman image is terrible don mean to compare it to nolan movie but there something wrong with it1.0\thave watched batman movies since christian bale started starting in me honestly this was the best batman movie this was dark like cartoons and comic books and just the way batman is1.0\tthe batman is compelling spin on the iconic character this story has been done so frequently that it hard to make it unique yet the batman distinguishes the character by focusing on his detective side the riddler serves that angle well presenting puzzles for wayne to crack and solidifying the movie noir tone meanwhile this is the most damaged film version of wayne there is his character is slightly monotonous more dramatic outbursts would ve been nice but pattinson elevates that material with wounded postures and troubled looks plus dano kravitz farrell and wright all deliver fascinating performances keeping the emotional spectrum dynamic furthermore the batman has assured craft the production is realistically grimy serving the corruption plotline the music is imposing and melancholy melding the sorrowful mood with its glimmer of hope the cinematography uses attached camerawork overheads focus changes and distinct colors to heighten intensity intrigue and atmosphere lastly the batman unexpected highlight is its sound because of rich combat ominous introductions and abstract climaxes often batman intimidating footsteps are heard before he emerges and silence signifies overwhelmed characters ultimately the batman isn the best in its illustrious franchise but it still an exceptional experience writing 10 direction 10 cinematography 10 acting 10 editing 10 sound 10 10 score soundtrack 10 production design 10 casting 10 effects 10 overall score 100.0\tpattinson as batman is very average keaton bale clearly are above the rest this is maybe equal to val kilmers batman which was equally forgettable whereas this doesnt stoop as low as clooney best part of the movie was clearly oz played by colin farrel and was thinking watching this movie that if they decide to carry on with this cast they should show us the movie from the point of view of the penguin who was the most interesting character and then batman would be more menacing threat as he is not shown all the time anyway as you can figure out this movie wasnt that great when was already thinking about the next one and how it could be improved to break the boring mold they insist on doing these movies over and over again you can also tell when the director isnt that good at his job for example the driving scene they are driving in pouring rain yet the tires of cars are screeching like at race track thats just dumb and as this was meant to be more realistic batman it showed they totally failed at that aswell1.0\tthis batman film is by far one of the darkest movies ve ever seen the acting of robert pattison as batman is very strong and his suit is awesome and wow zoë kravitz as catwoman is amazing riddler the villain his actions from beginning to end are so vicious when he wears his masks he talks like very creepy man that menaces riddler is certainly in the film the horror icon just an awesome and excellent film1.0\tthe movie is way too long an could ve been shorter about forty minutes if to cut off half of the unnecessary dialogues the interesting part came only in the middle end overall it an enjoyable movie with good actors and amazing visual effects1.0\tthe batman is comparable to previous versions as is the german netflix series dark is to twin peaks brilliant cinematic experience with an engaging storyline but at the same time humourless epic lacking in personality don get me wrong there is plenty to recommend the batman zoe kravitz cat woman is captivating robert pattinson bruce wayne batman gets the job done as usual colin farrell is unrecognisable as the penguin and there paul damo as suitably unhinged misfit aka the riddler the mid movie car chase takes some topping and the unwavering commitment to styling atmosphere and plot is commendable and there several memorable scenes and lines the door was just never left ajar enough to let sufficient light in for hour long blockbuster to warrant more than stars1.0\tthe batman is unlike any other batman film before it the plot is grounded in reality even more so than nolan dark knight trilogy 10 10 masterpiece1.0\tthe batman is true masterpiece the acting action writing and cinematography is truly superb paul dano riddler is terrifying villian that isn scary because of his powers but because of his intentions and realistic style doubted rob patterson at first but he turned out great and played the character to perfection the musical score was also great which helped develope the well crafted atmosphere that matt reeves brought forth1.0\tafter lot of turmoil in snyderverse batman once again rises as the apex hero of cinematic masterpieces courtesy of the genius of matt reeves neo noir detective thriller set in the murky streets of gotham riddler emerges to expose the lies corruption of gotham sends the entire city into disarray so many phenomenal performances paul dano as riddler turns the famous comedic sociopath into sinister genius who uses powerful men of gotham as puppets to unveil his grand design colin farrell totally unrecognizable as the penguin zoe kravitz as catwoman trying to survive fight against the dirty underbelly of gotham and of course robert pattinson as the young batman brimming with rage vengeance trying his damned best to change gotham doomed fate so many meticulously built scenes with solid dialogues with such satisfying payoffs some incredibly well choreographed action sequences top notch cinematography with some iconic shots some parts can feel bit slow but rest assured we have another legendary trilogy in making0.0\trobert pattinson not good fit waaaaaay too long and unjustifiably so miscasting for most supporting cast storyline warped inconsistent with the villain narrative bale legacy in tatters grand finale was unnecessary did mention it was way too long1.0\tit dark noir driven movie which is pretty predictable found the fighting scenes to be really good they didn cut on the punches so the choreagraphy look really good think jackie chan style the actor playing riddler is perfect for the role but other than that found the movie to be pretty flat and linear no tension and lot of unesecary moments fillers scenes the last 30 40 was probably the most dreadful but overall the movie isn bad but not good either but not so bad that didn enjoy watching it0.0\tno action no emotions no psychology no script no bruce wayne no story no epic no visual after bvs thought batman could not possibly get any worse as batman fan what really scares me is how many people actually enjoy the film1.0\tthis movie is fabulous violent well paced and just simply masterpiece you feel like you re apart of this movie you feel like you re in gotham city this is detective movie and you feel that this movie is immersive it takes you along and it keeps you engrossed the batman is unhinged and you can understand why every character plays their role fabulously and contributes to the story amazingly this movie deserves an oscar1.0\tthe batman is grounded in realism like the nolan films yet drenched with neo noir pulp that captures the comic book vibe of batman better than anything since the animated series like batman mask of the phantasm matt reeves for sure understands the character finally we got to see detective drama punctuated by moments of incredibly visceral action reeves direction is dark deep intense flooded with instantly iconic imagery live action batman movie unlike any we ve seen beautiful and also badass the script performances set pieces visual storytelling is phenomenal robert pattinson shines as an emotional brooding batman next to paul dano terrifying riddler zoe kravitz and colin ferrell are so goud in their respective roles there are scenes that will forever remain attached in your mind also some of the dialogues in particular those with the riddler will leave you speechless tremendous music from michael giacchino once again this guy knows the assignment most likely this is the universe that must continue to develop at full speed not the other one1.0\tthe only reason giving it an was wish there was more cat woman scenes of just her but overall loved it zoe kravitz and robert pattinson were1.0\tam life long batman fan and this definitely hits all of the right notes for me grizzled angry bruce in his second year as the batman is refreshing take on the tried origin methods in past movies was sceptical about patz but he plays his role really well and suits the moody tone the rest of the cast all excel loved jim gordon and selina kyle wow the chemistry between kravitz and pattison is electric the riddler plays an appropriately unhinged villain and special mention to colin farrel as the penguin who excels in every scene he is unrecognisably in the car chase is one of the best ve seen and matt reeves direction does not miss point now please start working on the sequel with all of the same people coming back as well as that one character we meet before the credits roll1.0\tthis movie is probably the best depiction of very young batman so far he is young but not brazen he is not wise but he is astute this movie did wonderful job of depicting down to earth batman who starts as someone who is unsure of his role and impact in the world but grows in character and belief as the story progresses the villain character was well built the story was clear and was meaningful in character development of not just batman but its world and also its villains plus really liked the fact that the movie was not afraid in leaning relatively strongly on the love life of batman more than other recent batman movies overall very well made and meaningful adaption of young batman and bruce wayne shown on screen all in very dark gritty classic dc fashion1.0\tnothing short of masterpiece the direction acting and storyline were on point if you re looking for movie that combines batman with dark gritty mystery then this is the one for you0.0\tafter snyder and nolan this version of batman is dramatic failure placing this batman in the same world as the flash superman wonder woman and even shazam would make him into joke this film may be reflection of the times this batman is motivated by his emotions and lashes out he doesn even refer to himself as the batman but rather as the vengeance the story may work best as an alternate universe character colin farrel penguin is definite highlight of this film the actor virtually disappears into the role1.0\texcellent take and story about the batman while it does not necessarily rise to the level of the dark knight trilogy it presents completely fresh and new dimension to the classic hero viewers beware it is as dark gritty and haunting as advertised not for everyone however it presents mystery in gotham city in way its cinematic predecessors never could1.0\tthis the best batman after dark knight mean the best can just watch it again and again each and every scene in sculpted as dc fan we have been waiting for this movie thank you the greatest movie1.0\tmust say that after chris nolan matt reeves explored different shade for batman no one ever can match the dark knight but this attempt is undeniably amazing and stand strong in front of the dark knight version we saw various versions of batman various shades but this shade is truely perfect cause everyone know batman is the greatest detective in dc universe right action scenes choreographed well compared to nolan trilogy mystery element give you vibe of some of the best mystery films like saw seven and zodiac all characters are brilliantly executed and acted direction is on the point and without looding interest it become an enjoyable and thrilling ride of 3hrs1.0\twhat many people would say the best movies of all time are usually the dark knight the godfather the shawshank redemption or citizen cane well believe this movie not just redefined batman as character but as changed what it means to be mystery movie now if this doesn get nominated for the oscars in 2023 give up because everything in this movie from the cinematography to the sound design is just steps above any movie besides dune have seen personally wish dune and this movie released in the same yea just to see who wins what oscar paul dano ridder is the best would have to go as far to say his ridder while not on scream much is more of scary threat than heath ledgers joker this movie also wins me over on how far they pushed the pg 13 rating there were points in the movie were forgot it was not rated if this is what we will be getting from matt revives am blessed1.0\tas fan of the original batman series was not really looking for this to do much for me but all can say was wow it was brilliant from beginning to end enjoyed everyone performance can wait for the sequel do yourself favor and experience the batman1.0\tthe darkest live action batman adaptation ever after batman returns it will fill you with sense of dread through the whole movie this is the closest we can get to the comic book style soundtrack action and cinematography win riddler stole the moments every time he appeared thanks to paul dano top acting performance and penguin is nice addition can believe that colin farrell behind the sick makeup matt reeves proved that he can direct true dark knight movie robert pattinson nailed the job as the troubled and distressed bruce wayne and also the more serious and intimidating batman1.0\tright off the bat ll mention that in terms of making good movie the batman is vastly superior to any of the garbage mustered in zack snyder titles as well as 90 of other cgi infested superhero movies with the usual tropes it well written well directed well structured and has plot which is smart and interesting the characters are also good and fit in well with the movie overall premise all of the reveals and plot developments tie in nicely with one another it just good textbook movie that does very little wrong you might then think why ve only given it 10 which isn bad score it just that for it to be an 10 or 10 it has to offer something incredibly unique and magical like dark knight 10 or logan 10 or even deadpool 10 appreciate the batman is different type of movie to some of those but at the same time it isn anything ground breaking like the nolan batman films were rather it very respectable effort of continuing the tradition of grounded realistic comic book movies with that said lot of praise needs to be given to everyone who made this it is very good movie that avoids the pitfalls of so many other lazy comic book titles out there1.0\tfirst of all this is the second best batman movie of all time we had to wait 14 years for batman movie that could compete with the dark knight and we got movie that came pretty close the casting is fantastic mean we need to realize that the vampire guy from twilight plays batman honestly it sounds like the beginning of good joke but damn robert pattinson knocks it out of the park as more scarred bruce wayne but personally thinks paul dano as the riddler is the star of the movie he plays the riddler villain in the same line as heath ledger joker an all out psychopath but with great performance bringing the character to live this batman movie is able to combine the elements of se7en zodiac and even saw into great detective story with surprising end and some carefully placed plot twists that will keep you thinking about the movie for long after you saw it also congrats to michael giacchino to compose the best batman soundtrack ever further are colin farrel as the penguin and zoe kravitz as catwoman great character with their own fleshed out backstory and last but not least jeffrey wright is my favourite james gordon he has great chemistry with the batman and is this ichabod crane like detective who want to solve the case at all cost so this is the batman we deserved and needed darker more evil and just amazing go and watch it as soon as you can cause you don want to miss this masterpiece of comicbook movie0.0\tknew once fell asleep wasted my time never fall asleep in the movie theater it was too long too boring with little action it didn feel like batman movie it was huge disappointment1.0\tas major fan of batman cannot express more than saying that this film is fantastic it deserves sequel and is really the perfect adaptation of young inexperienced batman finding his feet well done all involved cast crew1.0\tdon have much more to add that positive reviews haven mentioned absolutely loved the usage of nirvana something in the way it worked so well after affleck turn as batman thought my favorite hero glory days were behind him but rob gave me redemption hope the next as dark jus hopefully tad shorter1.0\tpeak cinema and the most batmanish batman live action film has ever felt the worlds greatest detective aspect of the character is finally shown and is all the better for it1.0\texcellent mystery compelling the entire time and satisfying asthetically and emotionally scott snyder was thanked in the credits so if you have read any decent issues from the last few years you ll love this truly for the fans1.0\tit was good movie but there were several flaws one was the fact that there was no difference between the batman and bruce wayne in previous batman movies bruce would be the playboy and fake identity while in this one it felt like robert pattinson was only playing batman the whole time0.0\thorrible movie quiet boring hours of nothing waa about to sleep during the movie no action or fight scenes weak plot poor acting by the whole crew0.0\tsomeone watching seven and tokyo ghoul and crow while writing this boring tasteless movie looking forward to batfleck now in dec since this was let down for all batman true fans1.0\tmy god where do begin wit first off robert pattinson is one of the best actors in hollywood right now he deserves applause for his performance in the devil all the time tenet now the batman this has to be said cause he silenced so many haters when he was announced as batman haven seen his twilight movies but what we all know is not one actor has went into top scripted movies all his career never judged him but doubted him as batman cause thought he be great as batman beyond rather than bruce wayne boy was wrong he was unreal as bruce wayne from the look with the eye circles to no smile all pain and depression been portrayed by pattinson in his bruce wayne character on top level love the way how matt reeves made it possible that recognized gotham so dark and with all the rain it creates an atmosphere you re about to accept gotham the city as character in the movie from what ve heard many stunts including the batmobile through fire were real love that those scenes including the fighting choreo were impressive the cast was well chosen couldn recognize collin face paul dano as riddler gave me zodiac vibes the chemistry between batman catwoman was good want more the script was thrilling and exciting still think hours felt bit stretched towards the end the riddles makes you think and actually contribute into the movie what brilliant way it reminds me so much on true detective season seven zodiac the riddler was hardcore scary and made me jaw dropping few times could talk so much about the movie go watch it you won regret it dc should start reboot in their twisted universe with this masterpiece this has huge potential for more1.0\tthis how batman should be the back alley level dark walking in the rain and hunting like an apex predator the batman is pure masterpiece the cinematography direction music soundtrack storyline writing action sequences and visuals were literally perfect1.0\tbest batman movie on par or even better than the dark knight it was everything was expecting from the movie and more the cinematography was amazing and gave me goosebumps throughout must watch for sure0.0\tunlike zack synders justice league where the movie was better extended this would serve better if it was reduced by an hour at least when will it end was the question after pointless scene after pointless scene it looked good but thats about it if you suffer from insomnia go see this don believe all the 10 star reviews pretentious types who like to torment themselves1.0\tit good but it not as good as any of the dark knight trilogy movies think people are getting ahead of themselves and are forgetting just how good those movies are1.0\tan amazing introduction to new world and era everything was on point and that batmobile omg small critism didn get why the riddler let himself caught so easily and alfred wasn top notch for me nor he didn get enough screentime to be one the only thing give and not 10 cause the ending scene was bit rushed for me could have finished with more bigger bang than it was thrown together but everything else was amazing truly great movie experience definitely in the top dc movies for me next to for vendetta and constantin can wait for the next one till than ll definitely rewatch this0.0\twhere have we seen this story before wonder apart from the repetitiveness of the story wonder in their right sober mind thought robert pattinson was the right actor for the role he has neither the right build nor the voice that meets the caped crusader with those remaining fans of dc will hope little robert don return1.0\tthis was movie that had myself and many worried how many batman movies do we need but this one did not disappoint the action is great and the acting is amazing the only reason do not give this or 10 is because the ending seemed to drag on for bit couple scenes could have been shortened and the movie could have been 10 15 minutes shorter also for any parents of young children reading this this movie is not really for little kids my theatre had 10 kids below the age of 13 and they seemed confused and or scared most of the time this is darker grittier batman movie hope matt reeves makes sequel to this great batman film1.0\tthe movie is masterpiece incredible bit slow but damn the riddler also is amazing and pat is my fav batman so far he did incredible as expected actually dont like him personally but damn that was fine movie the dark knight seven the movie mixed together1.0\tmatt reeves boldness has definitely paid off in the dark knights favour this time the ultimate detective superhero film will leave you with chills from the get go the new era of the dark knight has begun and all for it0.0\tdo not understand how this movie is so highly righted this was so long dull and boring rather watch the twilight trilogy maybe not that bad pattinson was better than expected but that not saying much he was moody dull half vampire half bat man no charisma no charm very weak batman the tone of the movie was good the dark and gritty effects gave the movie genuine gotham feel at least how it meant to be portrayed in the comics lighting was good good car chase and some good scenes the baddies were excellent colin farrell was unrecognisble dano was great as the riddler and kept you on your toes kravitz was great eye candy and good edition all of these characters were far better than batman there was no humour farrell wasn used enough kravitz story was too long and boring and eventually after hours the movie goes absolute nowhere hours of my life completely wasted the last hour was not needed at all nothing happens and batman does absolutely nothing in the whole movie pattinson is good actor but terrible in this it would have almost been better if batman was not in the batman movie when you rather watch the riddler and the penguin over batman something must be terribly wrong1.0\tthe most comic accurate batman from the suit the year one year two batman storyline broken bruised bruce wayne young imperfect but growing inspiration and little teases from plethora of batman content out there so many of the scenes seem to be taken right out of the pages of comic book or an animated movie fincher ish take on the world greatest detective exceptional cinematography and production design coupled with strong impactful individual performances from the entire cast each with their own solid built up storylines and the brilliant brilliant background scores the batman movie we all deserved this is an absolute treat for all the batman fans out there1.0\tthis movie is amazing the character development is just perfect the plot twist in the story is just incredible don even expect it at all this is how dc movies should be 10 10 best dc movie ve ever watched since joker 2019 really recommend this movie1.0\ton paper think this approach to batman movie is perfect fincher esque detective story with film noir visual palette insightful social commentary and flashes of stunningly rendered action but sadly don think matt reeves quite connected all the dots to make his perfect approach into perfect film it absolutely entertaining and has plenty to like but fails to live up to its potential first the things that work robert pattinson was perfect for the role managing to play all elements of the batman bruce wayne character just as they should be he really nailed the physicality of the role which is must considering he spends upwards of 80 of his screen time behind the cowl but as bruce wayne he also brings serious offness that you would expect from traumatized recluse the rest of the cast is really great too paul dano being the notable stand out aside from pattinson the visual aesthetic is excellently realized as well hardly five minutes goes by without shot being so beautifully lit and blocked that you wish it lingered on screen bit longer cinematographer greig fraser delights in the gloominess and brings the absolute most he can to shots of dark alleys moonless nights and hauntingly empty mansions this film also walks the line brilliantly between action and suspense the action scenes never last longer than they should and always leave you wanting more rare treat in modern blockbusters which are usually stuffed to the gils with superfluous car chases gun fights and explosions and in between the action there is genuine storytelling getting you invested in the characters and plot so that the next fight scene feels earned speaking of the storytelling reeves and co writer peter craig made the wise decision to center the film on great mystery who is the riddler and what he going to do next this is where batman detective side gets to shine and is especially great considering how downplayed the world greatest detective is in most film adaptations of the character the narration from bruce journal evokes classic film noir and goes hand in hand with the aesthetic and tone but despite having all these elements in its favor couldn help but feel slightly disappointed by the end result it not that it did anything wrong per say it what it didn do but teased in moments that left me feeling unfulfilled the biggest offender is that bruce batman character arc is thematically pretty muddled and feels like its missing some major pieces considering how well the individual scenes are written guessing this isn necessarily failure of screenwriting the full character arc most likely existed on the page and was maybe even shot but due to time constraints had to be cut the movie is already hours long so any more would have made it unbearably bloated but what we re left with on screen is frustrating they set up some great thematic conflicts that have to be dealt with by both batman and bruce but only see them resolved by his caped persona in the end we get about one half character arc for our protagonist going in tandem with bruce missing character arc are the superficial bits of social commentary that don really serve any thematic purpose in few spots the film has characters quip about the privilege and inherent problems of the uber wealthy in decaying society but they never explore the issue any deeper the commentary is completely surface level to me this would be the perfect way to tie up bruce story make him confront the fact that he sitting on pile of money while gotham eats itself and realize he has to do more than just fight crime in bat suit wouldn necessarily demand that this commentary be included in the film can divorce cinema from reality enough to be fine with batman movie not addressing real world problems like the wealth gap but they re the ones who point to the issue without making point about it making the messaging seem hollow speaking of runtime another issue with this film is that it is absolutely too long especially considering my previous complaint that it felt incomplete in parts what we got was about 50 great build up and setting up interesting conflicts 25 big third act action at the end and 25 unnecessary subplots primarily involving selena kyle that add nothing but runtime fine with movie being long and slow paced but not if it feels like it needed to be longer still to tell an actual complete story as much as it might upset fans if selena kyle didn have mission of her own think the film would be far better without it as it would allow more time to pin down bruce character save the catwoman subplot for the sequel lastly mentioned the film is fincher esque and reeves was not shy about his love of se7en and zodiac you can probably do scene to scene comparisons between batman and gordon solving the riddler mystery and detectives mills and somerset searching for john doe to me this is problem it one thing to wink at the audience and slyly pay respect to what inspired you creatively but for the references to be so blatant and seemingly exist solely for the sake of making reference that really waters down the story you re trying to tell by making the audience think of better film in the end the batman is an ambitious fresh take on the character with plenty to love both on visual and emotional level that fails to add up to more than the sum of its parts is it great batman film possibly one of the best is it great film sadly no but reeves still managed to do enough to get me invested in both pattinson batman and the world to see what they can cook up in the next film and hope that it delivers on the promise of this film1.0\tthe plot cinematography acting all fit the purpose and theme of batman giving realistic and gritty aspect of him the mystery in this kept me intrigued completely people who cry about there not being corny jokes are children who can take mature movie what are you expecting it the literal batman not some disney made marvel movie that cracks joke when someone is dying0.0\tboring movie and would like to see ben affleck actor it called chapter and old story and dark screen nothing new in this movie we hope in the future they correct all this wrong1.0\tnot the best brucie nor the best batman ever but you ll get exactly what the title says the batman brilliant take on both bruce and batman story all the rage vulnerability and fear of both bruce and the bat were on display for all to see the bat gets more screen time and surely operates like how he supposed to in all his portrayal he investigates he made deductions and he acted on those not based on some algorithms ran through the supercomputer using super intelligent from an alien planet bruce is vulnerable broken and reckless with his life which beautifully translated to the fearless batman both of them are seeking validation and love in both worlds convincingly portrayed by the excellent rob patz if you re looking for superhero you won get it with this one this is not batman that throws shuriken hurls smoke bombs and fly bat shaped jet no this is the batman1.0\tthis movie is amazing from begging to end is fantastic brilliant acting the only problem is that is long but beside that is perfect paul dano she his scenes as riddler but robert pattinson proved that he is made for this role he is great batman and the movie proves it the art and colors are perfect as well the fort movie of batman we re feel genuinely in gotham1.0\tthis is the best batman movie ive ever seen its not another superhero movie its great crime movie with great ending truly appreciate the hard work in this movie you either leave it shocked and impressed or bored1.0\tmatt reeves does spectacular job at showcasing batman in the detective form we ve been waiting to see for so long the film keeps you drawn in from start to finish with unbelievably well pacing pattinson shines in the role leaving twilight far behind him who disappears into the character giving riveting take on the caped crusader and proving he one of the best working today the cinematography is visceral with greig fraser truly showcasing his talents in bringing gotham to life there is not bad performance in this film and all side characters played their roles to tee with zoe and colin shining mirroring classic crime thrillers in the likes of se7en and chinatown the batman is must watch for any fan of the caped crusader in one of if not the best incarnations of the character we ve seen1.0\tevery shot in this film is dripping with excellence the visual experience is nothing short of gorgeous and it is very apparent that matt reeves truly cares about the character and source material the film is breathe of fresh air from the traditional on screen batman experiences audiences already know if you are tired of seeing the one dimensional billionaire philanthropist portrayal of bruce wayne then you re in for treat the run time of 2h 56m feels well earned as there is not dull moment in the entire film the batman truly captures the overwhelming brooding presence of the caped crusader in way that no other movie does every footstep every punch and every line of dialogue is executed with chilling undertones any time robert pattinson is on screen as someone who was at first skeptical when he was cast as the batman am blown away by his performance this is must see movie that will stand the test of time and go down as one of the best if not the best batman movie to date0.0\tsubstandard because there is no batman that we were used to when we were young and the actor was not the best in the acting role also catwoman is not up to the standards and was one of the worst batman movies ever made0.0\tfilm is too slow some time you feel you are watching some criminal corruption movie like gabbar is back show batman is too strong and smart for every next move but here in this movie feel this batman not have confidence smartness that powerful gadgets too weak some where so much direction issue you feel camera man is just shoot video not movie1.0\teverything was amazing music was really good very dark good batman fighting scenes were good cinematic masterpiece making me wanna do flips and fight people after watching it1.0\ttruly enjoyed every moment of it and can wait to watch it again for all the easter eggs and scenes that may have missed this was more of detective movie than comic book hero movie vigilante still in his early years with lots of room to grow as protector and guardian of criminally corrupt city which is so badly infested that you don even smell the gutters anymore the movie has this raw and unnerving feeling that lets you know that it not going to be sunshine and daisies from the opening shots of dark alley under the giant sign in the clouds you know you re in for ride you ll never want to get off1.0\tas rush to my local theatre like delboy and rodney in anticipation for what can only be described as the latest intake on the never ending saga of batmania each interpretation either preceding the previous or leaving warm fuzzy feeling of wanting more it becomes clear batman is my bond not james bond however enticing and elegantly charming he might appear to the ladies this is no comedy and why should it be the guy lost his parents goddamn it okay so why so serious as matt reeve expands on his predecessor burton nolan we get different kinda batman much like the different kinda bond connection the fear and isolation that drives him is very relatable on this particular outing we have no need to see bruce parents gunned down in front of him one time too many like groundhog day it all so clear on pattinson face credit to his acting may add slowly becoming more comfortable in the suit than outta it bruce is like grey ghost with remorseless demeanour in the bat suit he is savage restless with rage and anger ready to be pushed past breaking point yet mellowed out just enough when gordon is nearby jeffery wright is different jim still he is worthy one nevertheless is he better than oldman say the characters are too different to compare there are so many different ways directors can approach these characters and yet the stories are timeless okay so maybe batman lego and adam west are bit dated in addition to being very distant yet batman somehow has the willpower to do the right thing which separates him from his adversaries uniquely gritty noir interpretation gives matt reeves chance to explore the detective within our dark knight with shades of sherlock holmes like never seen before on the big screen introducing one of my favourite antagonists from batman rogues gallery none other than the riddler paul dano captures the essence of everything expect the riddler to be in exquisite fashion yes he is narcissistic crazed lunatic however like most homicidal maniacs there is method to his madness much more what if everyone else isn so innocent he can be described much like john doe from se7en or jigsaw from the saw franchise paul dano hones this character to its core perfecting it and making it his own he is literally the riddler whilst he questions the morals and exposes some untold truths after playing the much beloved arkham games remember wanting to see serious portrayal of edward nigma aka the riddler even so this exceeded my expectations with stunning visuals captivating score by michael giacchino matt reeves brings gotham to life with an underworld of corruption touched on previously in batman begins this time we get more in depth look at the mob from carmine falcone to salvatore maroni alongside oswald cobblepot iceberg lounge much like nolan vision nobody or not much is safe in gotham therefore we find ourselves in the cross fire wondering who is really pulling the strings colin farrell does splendid job as the penguin he is certainly more believable and real world esque far from monster in the sewers nevertheless it keeps you intrigued in finding out who is at the top of the ladder holding the brass ring much like stray cat at first glance just like the batman we the audience aren fully engaged in trusting selena she is salty swift slick silhouette feline who can pounce at any moment especially if antagonised once more in the batman universe where most make the wrong or poor decision bruce often makes the right ones there was some stand out scenes like to mention from my first viewing for me the batmobile chase cinematography was dark knight level epic plus strong scene from andy serkis as alfred gives well rounded substance and value to the fatherly son relationship of bruce and alfred pleased our main protagonist is once again the focus much like in batman begins and is on an equal playing field with his nemesis this story along with its main protagonists character arc is essentially the key to making good batman movie combined with narratives we can feel sense of justice in each small victory tune in next film as the batman reminds us why the cinematic experience is far from dead1.0\tamazing movie would like to recommend to anyone that wants to watch this even if you aren fan of batman they nailed the character perfectly the riddler and casting robert pattinson as batman was good choice they need to make sequel with scarecrow or joker the movie matches the theme of gotham perfectly1.0\twhen went to watch this movie at the theaters didn thought would love it so much and now it on my top favorite movies of all time above movies like once upon time in hollywood and last night in soho to me this movie is masterpiece on every single area from directing to acting from the photography to the soundtrack almost everything is perfect and what is not perfect it is close to getting there way better than dark knight or bvs1.0\twill say straight at the top that can quite put my finger on what was missing to make it perfect but there definitely feels like some sort of spark of something not really even going to address casting as every batman film people seem to get their knickers in twist when casting is announced and then they always have to eat their words this film is beautiful to look at so many beautiful sunset shots but also just dark atmospheric shots people need to get over the runtime of films hours is nothing compared to back in the day when they were hours long say the more the merrier stop complaining about batman as character and gotham as city also character in it own way being depressing where have you been maybe do just an inch of research before you watch batman film so you don get surprised by it being depressing we aren in the adam west days anymore there one thing definitely don like and that the ears on the cowl they look so flimsy and brittle they re too thin that just being really picky though this isn just good superhero film it good film it felt almost like it was spin off of se7en there was such an intent of concentrating on the aspect of what makes batman the world greatest detective it about time we had that he is ridiculously smart ve seen people sort of complaining about this bit saying that there too much talking and not enough action they re weird don listen to them1.0\tcan you get better representasion of barman pattinson did great the story action and visual setting in this movie is something haven seen been done in many years it comes short compared to the dark knight but this overcame all expectations music 10 10 acting 10 10 action 10 10 setting 10 10 effects cgi 10 10 villain 10 not as good as joker but extremely well done and written batman 10 pattinson did great job as batman and looks very much like the comics although wayne is not well done in this movie even considering the low screentime1.0\tone hell of ride if you are fan of movies like se7en and zodiac and gut punch of film if you are not all around the acting the directing the score it was all great don be deterred by robert pattinson as batman he gives us one for the ages will still see the extent of his bruce wayne in further installments after the utter disasters that were batman vs superman and justice league batman is back on track awesome1.0\tit well made and unique spin on character but it clocks in at hours and feels like really enjoyed the detective story though and the acting is good my only other complaint is it real downer as far as mood and there almost zero comedic relief know batman in general is serious story but this was little much1.0\tloved this movie the beginning of the movie alone had me drawn in and the movie just got even better with every scene after that definitely the best superhero movie to come out in years1.0\tgood film enjoyed it and it will get better with the next one that comes out robert patterson done fantastic job on that role many will be surprised1.0\tit hard to describe just how unusual and striking this film is it is remarkably good at taking it time the pace allows subtler emotions to bubble to the surface in the absolutely electric performances from pattinson kravitz for the first time gotham feels like more than 2d cutout ask yourself in the dark knight did you really feel the city beyond set the people of gotham were abstract the same think goes for the earlier batman films but this production immerses you in new world filled with rich filled out characters bruce wayne is appropriate for once unhinged bit broken far cry from what we ve seen and far more interesting to boot it odd but seeing this film you realise what even nolan great films were missing things you didn realise should ve been there the expressiveness in the eyes of batman his intelligence and sense of drive the chemistry with the female lead the people of the city in general are present when this film is good perhaps the first 5hours it is the best batman film and superhero film ever made think that fair to say it does lull bit and have few misses in the second half but overall it stands out as one of the most interesting films of the comic book era1.0\toverall new take and good starting point on this new line of batman it had its moments of being slow but was more than likely due to it being hours long the originality on this version is what makes you enjoy it the most and the cast was really good this falls in line at the same level as batman begins which gives us hope on this being successful new series of batman films1.0\tve been looking forward to the new batman movie for really long time and this one really worth it great storyline perfect casting especially the catwoman and riddler even the music is amazing as twelve year dc fan really love how this movie portrays riddler1.0\tone opinion about the batman zöe kravitz this is what dc looks like this is what dcu must be like thrilling from beggining to end pattinson as usual breath taking what incredible gaze1.0\tmatt reeves did an absolute great job with directing the batman he truly understood the deepness and darkness of the character and knew how to portray it on screen the batman is true cinematic masterpiece the cinematography by graig fraser matches the tone of the movie the soundtrack by michael giacchino is dark and beautiful at the same time and ll soon touch upon the actors portrayals whenever talk about batman or watch one of his movies like to see him in his darkest most brutal form this is the best form of batman ve seen in quite while after the dark knight trilogy the moment saw the first trailer felt like david fincher directed this film and indeed it does have some strong elements of fincher movie seven along with other strong elements from shows like mindhunter and true detective the plot of the movie goes well with the character because first thing first batman is detective he figures out crimes the movie in general gives nod to the old superhero comics and that is element liked now speaking of the cast robert pattinson is great batman and we re looking at his early years as the dark crusader pattinson performs as young and impulsive bruce wayne who tries to figure out the sins of his family legacy zoë kravitz steals the show as catwoman really enjoyed her performance paul dano is basically the new zodiac killer and love it performances by colin farrell jeffery wright john turturro and andy serkis were brilliant now because it three long hour movie that doesn mean anything this movie gives slap to the face to the mcu and all its random movies in conclusion the batman is true cinematic masterpiece that should be rewarded and well respected definitely the darkest ve ever seen1.0\tthe movie that finally depicts batman as good detective but dark and troubled character and full of anger that is suppressed but taken out on villains the score is amazing dark and raw you have to see it just go and see this masterpiece everyone is comparing this movie to the infamous trilogy which also love but but can say the dark knight trilogy is better nor can say this one is better both are masterpieces and they can be compared directly both are equally great different takes on the same character the same way you can compare heath ledger joker to joaquin phoenix joker again equally great different takes hope dc rebuilds itself around this new take on batman which has similarities with batman from some animations finally hope this batman and the joker joaquin phoenix version meet in movie we already have the fun mcu we need this dark dc movie universe my head is still playing the score from when batman appears in scenes1.0\tthe first half was 10 the dark feeling and build up was awesome but the 2nd half was also it felt 30 minutes longer than it should have been wasn the only one who said and thought so1.0\tbest story and best cinematography best action best acting everything is best in this movie really like this movie this is the same batman that consider to be my favorite superhero just like the batman described in the comic book the best detective in the world the batman1.0\tthe batman had some laughably bad woke dialogue at times it was just so on the nose and took me out of the movie leaving me rolling my eyes that said this was by far the darkest batman we ve ever seen and loved it pattinson pulled off great batman to my surprise but his bruce wayne came off like some dark emo kid didn work all and all this was more of psychological thriller than an action show and loved it that not to say it had no action it did some great action actually but it took backseat to the psychological detective thriller this movie really was the riddler was fantastic give 101.0\tover the years we have seen some astounding batman movies and must say all of them were exceptional in their own ways bale was good dark knight affleck with snyder had very good influence among fans being the front of the justice league but think pattinson really nailed the batman role this movie connects you to the batman and most importantly to the gotham city more than any other movies out there knew this one was gonna be good but didn know it was gonna be this good was really at the edge of my seat the entire time slow and steady wins the race all the scenes if you observe perfectly this is the best work of art in the modern cinema all the castings were perfect and paul as the riddler gave me chills zoe kravitz is my fav cat woman now hats off matt reeves0.0\twow that was hours won get back unfortunately this was probably the most boring batman made robert paterson did make great batman but bad bruce wayne the story was all over the shop cinematography was dark you could barley see the movie it was stretched out almost unforgivably just when thought you could leave it goes for another hour will say the riddler was brilliant and colin farell was unrecognizable batman was like crow version of the character which is fine direction but the movie could hold the depth it was going for1.0\tthere is reason why this movie called the batman this is the longest appearance of batman in live action movie ever bruce wayne just side character batman in full suite 80 of the movie of all the batman movies live action and animation never felt what is the bat signal meant for the people of gotham especially the crooks mat reeves able to shows how the bat signal incite fear to the crooks also never see batman doing actual detective works in movie this movie have the best bat detective sequences ever and his partnership with jim gordon is the best iteration ever witnessed when the batman spoke thursday october 31st yeaaahhh sucker for movie with narrations right then knew gonna love this movie and the investigation itself is very interesting riddler is crazy af all the riddles he left for batman and jim to solve are mesmerizing and so invested with the investigation works hours just flew by all the cast are amazing robert pattinson are amazing and he really looks great in the suit the bat suit itself is menacing colin farrell is the most amazing cast still can recognize him behind the make up his accent is sublime paul dano as the riddler chilling performance he is crazy af don know what kind of joker matt reeves gonna give if there sequel to top the riddler this is the best batman movie ve ever watched if you re fan of mcu type superheroes movies don know whether you would ve like it but if you are fan of criminal investigation movies like se7en this movie is heavily influenced by se7en you definitely gonna love the movie highly highly recommended 10 10 find the best sounding cinema because you need to hear the introduction of the bat mobile holy goosebumps the revving jet engine make the hair on the back of my neck stand up1.0\tquite liked it surprised by the choice of robert to play batman but think he did really well once you stopped expecting him to glimmer everytime the sun comes up god thing its constantly raining in gotham liked that they have returned the super buff bruce wayne character back to more normal size the costume does however sometimes look bit stiff on him don know much about books and how it should look but was entertained and that was what was hoping for it seemed fresh even though we had seen the idea and story before1.0\tany one who says batman is too dark obviously doesn know anything about the character batman this movie isn for families and never advertised itself as one this movie was great it was dark and gritty and felt more faithful to the comics robert patterson was brilliant as batman you can tell he really put his all into the character and glad this movie is in its own universe and not the mess the dceu is this movie definitely was too long felt like it was directors cut and not trimmed and concise film but overall this might be my favorite rendition of the caped crusader batman is my favorite superhero and this movie reminds me why1.0\tnot the best but one of the best batman movies despite being superhero the movie shows his detective skills to great extent and boy it is refreshing to watch think the choice to riddler adds so much here the puzzles riddles and mazes lead to one answer after another it more of mystery thriller than superhero and it for the best it one of the reason why 3hr is the best runtime for the movie the cast is perfectly and like the version of pattinson young batman it would be shame that we don get to see more of him in this character another thing like is the production quality some shots and scenes are really well done all fights scenes are amazing that car chase sequence was so brilliantly shot it reminded to be the chase scene of the dark knight the music was fit to the dark theme of the movie the movie probably be the darkest in all batman movie riddler did good job in being the villain but he lacks something which doesn make him scary overall it good watch but for dc fan it must watch1.0\tthis movie catches the mood of gotham city so perfectly and thats espeacially because of the lighting probably the best lighting ever seen in movie the fight scenes are perfect as well as that carchase the first time he turns on the batmobiles engine uff like the more realistic approach they took in this movie mixed about the new batman he is very dark for sure and really looks awesome in that outfit and robert pattinson is extremely good actor so have no problem believing it bruce wayne it just when he takes it off he looks quite lot smaller than when he has the outfit on so it looks kind of wierd and also he is always so mad sad and serious so hes not very likeable but of course maybe he is not supposed to be but at least the old batman christian bale of course smiled sometimes not lot but sometimes but the only gripe had about the hole movie was it didn have to be that long because they come back to the same places and talk to the same bad guys so many times and it typically just because of misunderstandings but overall it awesome movie and would definitely recommend certainly 10 times better than justice league1.0\tfinally good batman movie the movies with ben affleck were so terrible that they should have sold ropes with tickets so that after watching ben affleck as batman you could hang yourself this one does justice though batman should have been bit more like joker but guess this works all charachters are well played and there is jist of what they are1.0\tafter consecutive years of average and less than average movies dc has gone and shown that they are capable of putting out excellent films too matt reeves the batman is alongside movies like joker and the suicide squad piece of work showing the quality of dc if they actually don hinder directors from creating what on their mind the batman is dark and brutal movie really pushing its pg 13 rating to the limits with robert pattinson with great performance alongside the likes of paul dano colin farrell and the rest of the cast the cinematography and score is excellent too but do feel like wanted to see more of paul dano all in all the batman is major stepping stone toward the right direction for dc and comic book movies and it is perfect example that taking risks pays off it is the first time we see the dark and gritty side of batman this clear and it doesn disappoint1.0\teven though when was going to the cinema my expectations wasn as big as the critics made other people was very impressed in good way robert pattinson portrays excellent the confused batman the batman that is not very sure of what to do besides that every other member of the cast played their role very good and that is rare thing nowdays now the soundtrack is the best soundtrack have heard in while amazing it fits perfectly with the noir atmosphere mat reeves is trying to give to the movie in conclusion the movie is totally worth watching but firmly believe that it can be compared to the nolan movies it is 10 movie and don think that we will talk about it in some years like we are doing with the dark knight trilogy1.0\tall in this movie is beautiful for me one nolans trilogy in another level but matt reeves do great pattison is great bruce wayne and gothem is shown very good dark with lot bed guys and there are young batman vs all of them must see for comics lovers1.0\tloved the cinematography so much wow and the plot was very consistent even tho it was 3hours acting was really great too who would ve thought that about robert pattinson omg enjoyed this movie sm1.0\twell cinema was full of dc fanboys who were crying that there was no jokes in the movie and how whole film was dark in both scenario and recording personally loved the movie1.0\tunique original and breathtaking batman adaptation with an epic feel and impressive visual magic character study rather than cliché superhero flick matt reeves brought new perspective for the batman lore by introducing grounded approach for gotham and batman rogues gallery three hour detective noir thriller that is very on brand with the caped crusader1.0\tthe batman is crime thrilling slow burn detective driven drama action that delivers in all the right ways for me its is hard for me to think of anything wanted done different for as long as remembered my idea of batman was very similar if not on point to how visioned my batman to be and to me that means lot matt reeves directed this film beautifully making you soak in the atmosphere of the world that is gotham and with amazing cinematography and beautifully gritty score making this world of gotham come to life and truly immerses you into this great acting all round robert pattinson studied the batman zoe kravitz as selina kyle was gorgeous paul dano riddler was amazingly thrilling and colin ferrell penguin was my favorite so far loved his performance and the makeup artists should be recognized for there work on him even jeffery wright find had cool way to inventing his jim gordon believe matt reeves has outdone himself and believe that the batman is his magnum opus story directing writing cinematography score and acting stand out for me and wont be surprised if this movie gets nominated for these categories well done matt reeves and looking forward for more movies and spin off series of this fantastic world0.0\trobert pattinson is the worst batman ever the rest of the cast is great even the director and story are good but pity they get pulled down by the morose millennial whimpy main character so many other better options that could have been considered1.0\tin my opinion the dark knight is pretty much the benchmark for batman movies and this didn come close robert patterson is great actor and did good job in the role which seemed to be bit controversial for some people the worst thing was the villains seemed bit tepid and there was definite lack of menace it was written with certain realism which understand but in superhero movies prefer more super villain types the storyline is well written and kept my interest but there was just something missing and to be honest still can quite put my finger on what that was this isn bad movie by any means but not one of rush to tell people about1.0\tdc fan so know was going into this movie biased was at least going to give it or depending on how far off and bad it was at least knew the cinematography and score was going to be amazing but yolo so going for 10 pattinson delivers and then some and dano was such great choice it was scary suspenseful thrilling and emotional couldn believe was about to cry in batman movie but held it together not without trying going to see this movie so many more times if for nothing else those car chase and arena scenes0.0\truined the movie with woke nonsense turned it off after half hour when realised that all the black actors play the good guys and the baddies are only played by white actors then cat woman said the line white privilege was my que to reach for the remote1.0\tthe batman amazing movie however beg of you do not take your kids under age 15 to see this movie if you haven noticed the last batman movies were getting darker violet and intense during the years and this movie is no different if you re old enough to remember the movie sins with brad pitt the new batman movie resembles it lot overall the actor robert pattinson did good job in playing batman who was hero but also human being with feelings and weaknesses and he managed to get it through while wearing mask so kudos for that the action was also there as it should be and haven noticed how fast the hours went by again if you re old enough to see it go and enjoy the movie highly recommend0.0\tthis movie was so slow when there was finally good cat chase scene thought oke it is finally getting some where but no very disappointed do have to say that colin farrell was so good as oz could not recognize him at all hé was so good love robert pattinson but not as batman no this was loooonngg hrs there was no clear story line it all moves soooo slowwww and there was no build up to great big scene so no this was not good one for me1.0\tafter years of anticipation the batman is thrilling dark and captivating motion picture that delivers on all levels overall the story is well thought out with similarities to films such as se7en prisoners and zodiac the film has sense of christopher nolan the dark knight which expresses new and exciting aspects that dive deeper into the original published comics by dc the cast really showcased enthusiastic performances by bringing new take and style on the characters of gotham city robert pattinson as bruce wayne batman was new and engrossing and his on screen chemistry with zöe kravitz as selina kyle catwoman was almost faultless at nearly hours long the movie was thrill ride leaving me wanting more and more as each act went on matt reeves is to be commended for his take on this film and am excited to see what he has set up for future films regarding this gritty and exciting universe the visual effects were stunning and made the current marvel movies almost look like kid films the score and cinematography were beautiful and can imagine how well this film will be received at the 2023 academy awards matt reeves the batman is an impressive chilling and enjoyable cinematic experience that will remember and other movies goers will remember for years to come1.0\thad my doubts but no more this was amazing flick saw it in imax worth every penny will go see again keaton has benn dethroned as the top batman hands down the most graphic storyline for batman movie ever1.0\tsaw it with my still barely teenage son if you like your superhero films to have more interesting villains think that is plus here having avoided reviews had no idea who was the penguin but that was an excellent depiction and paul dano riddler was unhinged in fine fashion as well of course the nice thing about batman is that as heroes go he piece of work himself perhaps most fascinating in this re telling is how the film captures rampant distrust of one government the police even one family and friends how to resolve that is certainly one big and bigger than the film itself smaller more readily answered is when should watch chinatown with my kid as side note is it just me or whenever there car chase in film feel my interest stalling no disrespect to stuntmen and stuntwomen and pyrotechnocrats get that there is an art at play but it has an inverse effect on my excitement1.0\tthe batman is very dark film quite literally as well the film shows batman at his 2nd year of his job as masked vigilante an important point the movie makes is that it is batman in the skin of bruce wayne and not the other way around when robert pattinson plays bruce wayne in this film you can see the discomfort and the uncertainty zoe kravitz as the catwoman paul dano as the riddler make point about how both of them are comfortable in their masked outfits which allow them to be truly what their experiences motives revenge turn them into catwoman seeks revenge from her father for being abandoned and the riddler from the gotham city this is in contrary to the batman who still is trying to find his purpose he believes his purpose is to continue the wayne family legacy of giving back to the city but he does this by wreaking vengeance on the city criminals but at one point in the film he is not entirely sure about the wayne family legacy and has to take upon the work of rediscovering himself and his own motives this contradiction of scarred people and their need for retribution plays out compellingly between the three characters and is what lies at the heart of this film the film also delves upon the batman ultimate weakness his kryptonite if you will which is his fear of losing someone he cares about this is highlighted in at least scenes the film is heavily political in nature it poignantly explores how society treats and punishes its criminals and if that is the right way to go about it it also explores the fault in democracy how government which on the surface looks like it is elected by due process can really be puppet of criminal organisation the film opens with monologue by batman which turns out to be journal entry in which he ponders the question about the impact he has had on the city if any the film closes with another monologue by the batman in which he concludes that he should be symbol of hope rather than symbol of vengeance as mentioned before the film is literally very dark and it uses this darkness in interesting ways in its excellent action sequences the highlight was batmobile chasing the penguin sequence this film is standalone masterpiece fans will like to compare this with christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy but it really shouldn be compared as both are fundamentally different pieces of art derived from the same source material however this film does seem to pay homage to the dark knight 2008 in multiple scenes1.0\tdisappointed that couldn watch more of this freaking movie matt reeves you re stupendously genius and amazing filmmaker beg you to give me more of this world the batman is masterpiece in every sense owe you an apology robert pattinson1.0\tngl ve gone to every movie that dc and marvel related and in my opinion this movie is better than everything ve seen by far and even beats spider man no way home which is very high on my list the mood it puts you in from the beginning too end and the tone that the director has gone for works like charm this will be one of the most dark batman movies that you ll see but that the point of batman he not supposed to be perfect and matt really shows that in this movie hands down the best movie ve ever seen and hope there sequel too come1.0\tmust admit that when first heard pattinson was going to be casted as batman had my doubts but now humbly take back my thoughts pattinson is without doubt the best batman to date matt reeves magnum opus has perfectly encapsulated the brilliance of batman as detective and hero to gotham nothing could top how exceptional this movie is in terms of cinematography scoring cast acting and syncing1.0\thonestly ve been pretty excited for this movie matt reeves is great director and really like the casting in this movie so was very interested to see where they were going to go this is the most refreshing batman film we could have asked for it nothing like any other portrayal we ve had in the past as it finally goes into the more detective side of batman which his amazing also love the fact it the riddler as the main villain as he is one of the most interesting ones and sick of the same villains being rehashed every time they do batman film paul dano as the riddler is potentially the best portrayal of villain in any comic book movie since heath ledgers joker he plays the character with such menace and such charisma he great actor in anything he in and he really plays the mental disorder style role down to tee but yes robert pattinson is the main talking point of this film he is genuinely amazing he can forget about his past movies now because this is his best performance in any film and think he just shut up lot of haters with this film the film really leaves the door open for plenty of sequels and spin offs and really wish that warner bros would just sack off the dceu and build from this film honestly dc universe should be started with well built gotham story and then structured out to the more supernatural things after that and with matt reeves at the helm of it all think this could really be the start of something amazing this is the best comic book movie since avengers infinity war change my mind1.0\tthis movie is one of the most well crafted comic book movies have ever seen from the mesmerizing cinematography to the amazing plot and character development throughout the movie this movie really dived deep into the dark persona of batman all ll say is enjoy it it feel like your inside comic book0.0\toverall this movie was written and has decent story line the main problem becomes robert pattinson in his lackluster performance he shows no emotion even in the scene where motion is required he just goes through the lines this movie would have been so much better with different actor playing the part his batman voice is so bad his narrator voice would have been better to use as the batman voice than what we got the fight scenes where on par but very limited in the film it is dark film very noir and only couple scense do not feature rain alot of cool easter eggs well if you know thing or two about batman robert pattinson performance left you asking why you are watching the film and when will his scenes end the rest of the cast for the most part did fantastic job in thier roles don waste your time sticking around for post credit there is none wonder how this movie would have been is there was better actor with more than one rabbit up is hat1.0\tfor me this is the definitive batman movie and the best batman movie to put on film from the cinematography to the story to the acting and all things in between you could see the hard work put in by reeves and his crew robert pattinson includes so much subtlety in his acting chops that it adds so much dimension to the scene which he is in he accurately puts across the image of an orphan recluse who wants to say so much but is not able to penguin catwoman and riddler were amazing and unique in their own way plus there were so many other characters with fully fleshed out characters and story arcs this is three hour long movie which allowed reeves to do long takes and let us stay within the room with these amazing characters allowing us to soak in all the tension and world building because of which the movie may seem bit slow but there is always twist or an amazing scene waiting around the corner to up the ante this is an amazing batman universe that matt reeves has created and can wait to see more of it still think the dark knight is the better movie but this is definitely better batman movie1.0\tthe fact that the batman is getting compared to the dark knight while being the first movie of the franchise speaks volumes this stands out against lot of superhero movies we get today from the straight up practical effects use to and beautiful cinematography mixed with gritty relatable realistic world if you are expecting non stop action pop flick movie you ll be disappointed this is dark crime mystery thriller that fully explores all sides of batman while being truly comic accurate1.0\tloved this the most comic booky batman yet just wish they got more into the class warfare stuff they only briefly touched on and is it law or something that every modern gotham city film must be remix of taxi driver1.0\trobert pattinson zoe kravitz batman adventure is spectacular movie is hours long so if you have small bladder don eat or drink anything movie is about movie trailers but worth it there is an easter egg if you stick around after the credits0.0\twhere to begin with the atrocity that was the batman trying not to laugh in cinema full of people was extremely challenging this entire bore fest probably could have been cut down to 20 minutes and still wouldn have enjoyed it every character was so boring with zero charm and felt like could have walked out at any moment and not cared at all about the resolution the casting was questionable and the choice for the riddler was the best riddle yet can see lot of memes coming so if you like slow paces overdone music paper thin characters and wanting to gouge your own eyes out with melon baller watch this film you could not pay me to have to sit through that monstrosity again the batmobile was cool though1.0\treally last night was so excited and my excitement was worthy after watching this masterpiece the dark themed gotham city and the way of storyline was awesome1.0\tthis is the definitive batman from the comics on the screen for the very first time for the first time in live action version batman is the most interesting character this is character study on batman and is far from the usual comic book fare it is refreshing direction that is slow and methodical though it is technically not an origin story it weaves the beginning tales of iconic characters masterfully robert pattinson as batman and jeffrey wright as jim gordon specifically were highlights as their partnership was truly believable wright gordon in particular felt very world weary as it felt like gotham was consuming him that leaves gotham itself as it can clearly be seen how wretched the city is as it consumes everyone living in it while the plot has some minor issues and the pacing is not always perfect this is the best start yet to new batman story cannot wait to see where matthew reeves takes us next1.0\tthis is the batman we all been waiting for this nothing but pure batman movie they really explored the detective side of him in this movie that we never seen in any other batman movies it dark brutal gritty and love it the best batman movie have ever seen no words just masterpiece1.0\treally enjoyed this movie there is literally no flaws that can pick out from this movie riddler is easily the best villain have seen so far but there is one thing that did not appreciaye that much it was the relationship between alfred and bruce0.0\tboring too long unfocused bad cast except for penguin by the first half gone was counting the time to end batman portrayed as emo vampire rather than the superhero badass we are used to1.0\tthe batman is immediately apparent as being unlike anything we ve seen before the filmmakers interpretation of the batman is also remarkable with story that twists and turns until the ultimate sublimely tragic conclusion superbly rendered neo noir thriller starring robert pattinson as bruce wayne batman zoe kravitz as selina kyle catwoman and paul dano as edward nashton the riddler it focuses just as much on the suspense as it does on the well crafted action and it does so in an unexpectedly grounded manner this film has strong tone and mood immersed in pulpy and even horrifying study of this renowned character and those who cross him1.0\trobert pattinson automatically moves up into the spot for my favourite batmen don think christian bale could ever by unthroned in my view this tale seems less like superhero movie and more like crime thriller think that is what makes it fresh take on this sub genre1.0\tbecause the film began with why done it rather than who done it did not find the first thirty or forty minutes compelling this lengthy buildup simply lacked suspense thankfully then the movie takes off masterfully employing cat and mouse formula that kept me on the edge of my seat for the rest of the film1.0\tone of the best movies had ever seen in cinema hope anyone enjoying when he she watching batman going to watch it again and again it was great goat1.0\tfinally we are able to see the adaptation of detective batman without any flashy gadgets or fancy mobiles true batman movie with amazing performances and solid storyline but above all the suspense created throughout the movie1.0\tjust seen the batman and am pleasently surprised didnt expect much from pattinson but he really surprised me he is intimidating as batman he is on bale and keaton level as the bat however his emo bruce wayne is annoying he acts like he is sulky teenager lucky for bruce is in only like 10 minutes of screen time as far as villains go there is so many of them and they are really good paul dano and colin farell are briliant zoe kravitz is good as catwoman maybe if she had more things to do it would be better didnt really see much of her powers all in all excellent batman movie hopefully sequel will mature bruce and keep batman the force he is worth to watch1.0\t10 it truly unfortunate that when you hear the name robert pattinson you automatically think twilight however now that the newest batman film has dropped one might think otherwise thought that when robert pattinson was announced as the new batman thought he was going to be the worst depiction of the caped crusader however was wrong and pattinson does phenomenal job the darkness that surrounds the film is terrific don think the point of the film was to just get people to watch another batman film it was to get them to see story that means something at just under three hours long didn feel like was going through the motions of another superhero film was watching man story come to life there was struggle sacrifice love and so much more that it hard to contain in few words opposite pattinson was zoë kravitz and she did as phenomenal job as her co star she wasn just an empty character depicted to fill void during quiet times she was character that was brought to life whose story was just as important and made an impact on the film included with the main stars great performance will also say that the villains were just as satisfying to watch they didn just exist they existed to fight back and cause real problems that had me on the edge lastly to culminate the acting and story is the visuals and sound although mostly dark film the cinematography was still amazing lurking in the shadows is man bent on vengeance or is he lots of tense moments with shadows the soundtrack was spectacular it truly drew in the tension the heartache and the love surround the story dare say it was better than the dark knights soundtrack overall an absolutely phenomenal movie with strong story surprisingly incredible acting and soundtrack that enhanced everything highly recommend seeing this film in theatres if you get the chance for one hope to see it in imax or another enhanced viewing experience it was that good thank you for taking the time to read my review hope it helps you make decision on the film until next time enjoy the show1.0\tcontroversial opinion but this might be my one of the best batman film of all time it like the production team took all of the good things from past films and made sure not to make their mistakes1.0\tthe batman delivered more than expected watched it twice on imax and although it is hours long the pacing is perfect and it doesn feel like long movie the visuals the music is amazing and after watching an in depth podcast with matt reeves and the crew appreciate the work and passion that has gone into this movie even more did not have any expectations but was blown away although am bigger spider man fan liked this movie better than no way home even though these movies are not direct competitors my only suggestion is to watch the movie in imax or dolby vision the first time1.0\tthis movie is very good approach to the batman character it is close to the reality it happy to see this side of the character on screen movie shows how the muscularity does not affect the character it self movie is not perfect there were some downsides but overall great movie speacially the movie is visually pleasing1.0\tmasterpiece love the fresh take to the already established batman lore the cast shines robert pattison is perfect casting for most bridging bruce wayne the story is the real protagonist followed by the background score must watch1.0\trobert pattinson is obviously well known and very good actor but he truly embodies the role like have not seen since christian bale he is fierce intimidating calculating and not someone you ever want to catch in the wrong mood what you may not have expected however is that this is the riddler movie too and therefore detective movie throughout perhaps the thing christian was missing the most of bruce is using his brain and quick thinking skills more here than he ever has in live action movie selena kyle played by zoë kravitz is perhaps the most shocking standout and has more to her than meets the eye and throughout her chemistry with robert as batman and catwoman is the glue that holds this movie together the villains of this movie are honestly what you would want cold hateful brutal and of course loves to get on batman last nerve and make him truly think does he really deserve mercy the most surprising thing about this movie is bruce psyche his relationship with alfred his father figure is heartfelt while also being somewhat realistic when child experiences tragedy and how to live with it and what he going through the entire time and keeps you on the edge of your seat and his path to truly becoming the savior to gotham they need and deserve matt reeves has created not just one of the best detective movies ve ever seen but in my opinion stronger first film than even batman begins and the best batman movie since the dark knight ladies and gentleman robert pattinson is the batman and we are in for some incredible films if this movie is the floor rather than the ceiling we deserved this movie and everyone involved should be proud and excited for the future1.0\teverything about this movie from start to finish was very grounded it really depicted batman in way that fans will truly enjoy at first found it very hard to believe that robert pattinson can pull this off but boy was ever wrong you had to be there for every minute of the movie because every scene felt like it explained their interpretation of gotham city and how this batman came to be1.0\tmatt reeves has great command of the characters and the world and what world gotham is the biggest character it great to see all the sequences where batman bruce wayne selina kyle or whoever walks the streets of gotham it eye popping beautiful the end of the movie suffers little from the excess of cliffhangers somewhat reminiscent of the end of the return of the king where it always seems that the story will end only to give you another adrenaline shock and more story ahead but it not such big defect patinson is amazing whether or not he the best batman is irrelevant but it certainly great representation and the lesson well is contemporary and current hope the audience picks up and stops glorifying behaviors of some real life and fictional characters looking forward to the next one0.0\tjust not good movie it extremely drawn out and rambling and takes forever to get where it going by the last 40 minutes just wanted it to be over hours of my life that ll never get back would not watch it again1.0\teverything from the script the cinematography the ambience is improved from the dark knight trilogy the synchronization between the soundtrack and what is happening on the screen adds remarkable depth to the overall theme of the film in way that few movies have been able to achieve unlike tdk the dialogue is realistic engaging and thoughtful and you ll think about what just took place long after the next scene rolls around this isn superhero movie it gritty crime thriller with realistic protagonist well if you ignore the bulletproof suit and it has more than lot to say1.0\tin an era of comic book movies this one stands out first off absolutely breathtaking cinematography the best cinematography in comic book movie and rivals some of the great movies the score by michael giacchino is dark and foreboding and matches the tone of the film perfectly he is solidifying himself as one of this generation best composers the action sequences were top tier as well great choreography combined with the cinematography and phenomenal sound design truly shines in this movie needs to be seen in dolby the focus on detective work and the batman inner struggles are the highlights of the contents of the film at the ending of the film it seems tad bit rushed and could have used some more setup the ending of this movie seemed bit out of place overall solid film and beautiful comic book movie can wait to see where matt reeves and robert patterson take us1.0\twow just wow but that does not take away from the quality of the movie it features amazing action sequences good writing and compelling story highly recommend watching this new take on the it no dark knight but it solid and wonderful performanceamazing loved it from start to finish robert pattinson nailed it went to re watch it and it was even better the second time will go watch it third because it that good the way that pattinson portrayed batman and bruce was just chef kiss1.0\tthe batman has been hyped since it was announced and of course the internet went crazy when robert pattinson was chose as batman of course because covid this film was delayed and then delayed some more with the shadow of the christopher nolan dark knight trilogy casting very long shadow this film had pretty big hill to climb for me the nolan trilogy is the best comic book hero series ever in my opinion but when it comes to batman film can help but have high expectations what can say is that the batman exceeded those expectations from the first scene the film is even more dark and brooding than any batman film to date thankfully it not an origin story batman has been in gotham for years and he is going through the whole is he hero or villain thing that has been explored throughout the character history but this time it is more of focus the movie does take the dark tone nolan did but is even darker also it is more of detective thriller than an action film this time it is very film noir approach which is great also when it comes to it villain it feels very much like horror thriller paul dano plays the riddler as dangerous maniac his performance is very unsettling he not the funny riddler we are used to his performance is really good think director matt reeves paid some homage to david fincher because at times this film feels like the classic thriller se7en the tone is never light there is zoe kravitz as selena kyle catwoman who is also great match for pattinson the film is hours long but felt it moved very well was never bored it has car chase that is one of the best ve seen and even though it doesn feel as grand in scale to the nolan films it is grittier and more brutal ultimately it great batman film grade1.0\tall the main characters did good job forgot colin farrell was the penguin because he looks so different lots of action and decent story line it is long film so take snacks1.0\tmy first review who would have thought christopher nolan dark knight could be topped great film beautifully produced and acted directed can wait for the next installment1.0\twas really hyped but set my expectations kinda low and this absolutely crushed all of them right from the start when heard the theme song robert pattinson is great batman and isn even that far off of bale was also pleasently surprised with zoë kravitz since hadn seen her in any major roles before just have to highlight paul dano who is crazy nutcase once again maybe even my favorite part of the film greig fraser think he might be one of the next huge cinematographers could see him win back to back oscars at this point the whole atmosphere is so gritty and gnarly with its dark lighting and visuals never seen before just had to give him his own paragraph because he so good it not perfect movie it does have some weaker points with its writing and maybe it isn quite the new dark knight but loved it it just refreshing take on batman being this film noir detective style three hours flew by the batman kicks ass1.0\tnot quite tdk level but surely this gave it run the music was literally chills the dectectiveness was engaging and action scenes they were mind blowing rob pattinson is great batman the clues and dialogues were brilliant and the story it was masterclass the ending prison sequence was nuts and the ending fight it was literally sastisfying philosphically it not as deep as tdk but it was some and overall movie it was edge of the seat slow paced and awesome movie0.0\tvery boring and there is no sequence and coherence of events there are major failures in the scenario lacks strength and suspense in writing films of these last years should be reconsidered not worth watching wasted hours of my time on it not worth watching0.0\tam unable to enjoy the movie the movie is not good as what those media description and not worth to spend hours and money to cinema trust me aaaaaaaaaa1.0\twatched the movie an hour ago in the theatres and have to say that it is amazing even better than the dark knight robert pattinson nailed it as the batman and paul danu was amazing as the riddler too such great movie that everyone should watch you will not be disappointed1.0\tthe batman is technically well made brilliantly shot well acted perhaps bit too long but solid new reboot that could set us off on new and unique batman journey that perhaps this legacy character needs matt reeves brings us his take on the batman gotham dark knight in his second year of being the caped crusader takes on the serial killer riddler while also dealing with his own inner demons and startling new revelations about his own legacy bruce wayne goes on an investigative journey meeting friends and foes alike the run time is strength and an issue allowing the scenes and shots to properly flow and allow us to have an immersive experience in the new world of gotham which looks darker and more depressing than ever at the same time the film is ponderous and could do with little move the hell on they could have used it to give us little more backstory for batman or explain things better pattinson brings more emotional and depressed bruce batman to the screen struggling with issues of the past and present and battling to secure better future for both himself and gotham the latter proving to be an improbable task with crime on an irregular high and his presence having little effect this cess pool we call city riddler words have strong resonance with us and bruce his performance is pretty spot on but for some reason he is being told to display pretty one note depressing bruce from beginning till the end with indications of him becoming more layered for the next one bruce is supposed to have three personalities one to show to the world one as himself one as the batman matt reeves gives us an emo bruce all throughout which wears your interest off with it three hours of screen time perhaps the point is that he will now become the bruce we know but boy it sure takes long time just like daniel craig bond pattinson bruce is sulk with no fun allowed at all serious and sad always elevated by pattinson himself rather than the writing for the character zoe kravitz is good enough as selina kyle and gets some layered writing for her character jeffrey wright as gordon is brilliant and works ever so well with pattinson colin farrell as penguin andy serkis as alfred and john turturro as falcone round up the impressive cast the other major player who kicks things in motion is the riddler with an excellent turn by paul dano chewing out each scene he is in either with his voice or by his menacing presence he sure feels creepy with his sadistic riddles giving everyone run for their money he brings terror and camp to his version of the riddler unpredictable and scary dano just might be the underrated show stealer for this one michael giacchino score is phenomenal and the legacy of great batman music continues as is greig fraser cinematography perfectly capturing the dark alleys and crime ridden world of the city which elevates gotham to character of itself to some extent the script the general story isn all that intriguing at least not as the presentation which is bit of let down as you feel emotionally distant from our new emo bruce batman as result the emotional end and his change feels less personal and the long run time struggles to justify itself the film feels more like pre cursor an introduction to this new world with more to happen and to come later on its own it still manages to justify its existence and despite its flaws the film is pretty focused on its characters and their relationships and has enough fuel to run along to the finish line and provide good enough conclusion to round it all up the third act falls flat after all the buildup it feels that the stakes are quite low and has an anti climactic feel to everything that enrolls as everything gets quite easily resolved without much inconvenience overall the batman isn the best thing to happen to the character but new reboot that is worth watch0.0\tso far the worst batman ever watched and the worst part is it lasted that long trying hard to be the joker theme but failed in every single way it tried the production design and the way it tried to be gothic it dark and ugly in every way bruce wayne doesn even look rich he looks tired and poor0.0\tmost overrated movie of the decade don believe the fan made reviews still remember watching birds of prey in theatre reading all the the positive reviews posted by crazy fans just like that this movie is also overrated without nothing new to offer1.0\tthis movie is great this is dark beautiful music is very beautiful very good acting robert pattinson is great special effects is good very very very hype1.0\tve never actually taken the time to write review on anything because why would until saw this movie every single aspect of this film exceeded my expectations robert pattinson absolutely blew it out of the water with his performance as the world greatest detective the cinematography the groundedness it just had me wanting to rewatch every scene the minute it was over the entire supporting cast played their roles to perfection with paul dano showing us why he was the perfect casting for the riddler this was easily the first time ve watched any superhero film and just felt in awe everytime saw the main character on screen the suit was incredibly menacing and so damn pleasing to look at everything about this film man goddamn want to see it again1.0\tthe batman was film worth awarding nine stars couldn fault it it is dark and raw with fantastic appeal and brilliant charm robert pattinson was amazing as batman and will clearly grow and mature in to one of the best batman his portrayal as the young batman is fantastic and deserves the praise it is batman we haven seen before and will not disappoint anyone1.0\tjokes aside this movie is fantastic it captures all of the elements of an amazing movie and it takes its time all of the bad reviews are only based on how long the movie is believe that is flawed as this noir style of directing needs that time tldr watch this movie1.0\tdark broody rainy and emotional addition to batman movies rp is excellent as bruce wayne and batman his anger and rage is very believable and sets wonderful tone for the whole film his journey to realising he needs to be more hope than vengeance underpins the whole film supporting cast are all excellent and create whole new and very welcome world for further movies1.0\tthe batman movie off 2022 think that this is the best batman movie after the dark knight loved tje riddler and the character building think that this movie deserverse better rating than what it have1.0\tclassic detective noir story soaked in horror and psychological thriller elements make this the most unconventional blockbuster film in years pattinson is incredible in the role as expected alongside flawless cast gotham city epic production design along with the masterful cinematography and score combine to create fully realised criminal underworld and truly suffocating absorbing graphic novel experience it dark heavy and thematically rich with genuine focus on the emotional journeys of its protagonists truly unique the batman first and foremost tackles the childhood trauma of nearly all the characters revealing bruce motivation and perspective at this point in his journey bruce is fully focused on living and breathing as batman the scarred paranoid rookie vigilante is consumed with rage and revenge dynamic that matt reeves is able to establish incredibly well in the first half of the picture adored the vile gothic hellscape that is gotham city portrayed as place no one should find themselves in drenched in rain and grime adding to the sense of bleak hopelessness that fuels batman to carry out vengeance on the city that ripped his life apart the photography is exquisite retaining the pulp stylised elements that make this feel like it was lifted directly from the pages of the detective comics where batman was born it refreshing and undeniably exciting to see an auteur vision of graphic novel truly come to life from the nightmarish opening and the pitch perfect narration sequence introduction of vengeance to the lethal cat and mouse game between the riddler and batman there are litany of stylistic and narrative choices that feel decidedly authentic do wish the bruce alfred bond was developed little bit more so as to really punctuate lot of the emotional revelations that take place in the second half the film is also too long and would benefit from certain beats either taken out or at the very least re arranged in ways that emphasise certain key developments leading to the movie conclusion rather than hinder their impact despite this the batman is an audacious unflinching methodical police procedural reboot of character who has dominated the corners of pop culture for half century providing fresh immersive take that will leave comic book fans as well as regular audiences clamoring for more1.0\tthe movie is amazing is completed film action drama acting it is really good you all must see it thank you robert and all the actors in the movie you really did great job1.0\tpattison was beautiful surprise love his acting and voice he kind of skinny for this role personal opinion like batman big and strong not like aflec somewhere in between love the costume and the filter of the movie and it combinations with modern and old gotham0.0\tto say this movie is style ove substance would be lie since when you make movie that is style over substance the substance is still present this movie on reflection is style as replacement for substance and to add insult to injury it the wrong style went for batman ended up getting mid 90 edgy 13 year old emo kid writing edgy poetry at the darkness of life posting it on myspace after having watched seven the characters are thin character sketches over actual characters no one has personality or motivaiton or any sort of drive to achieve anything it was like watching children trying to play mummy daddy where the mummy declares you have to go to work because that what daddies do it that level of insightfulness to the concept of batman why does batman fight crime because it what batman does why does the riddler do what the riddler does because the writer watched seven decided that what the riddler should do as for the plot it drags out about 30 minutes of content over almost hours it is entirely incomprehensible because no one has reason to do anything1.0\tthe best batman movie and robert pattinson as batman nailed it the acting the cinematography everything is great about movie the riddler is amazing and his riddles1.0\tand that statement knowing how many comic book movies many of us have seen in the past 15 20 years this was just like reading batman the long halloween or re interpretation of that storyline cinematically it takes significant inspirations from se7en but more recently has tone like the joker movie also surprise hit some may be intimidated because the theatrical version is three hours long and you don want to sit in the theater for that long remember watching the lord of the rings movies years ago and don have problem with longer theatrical releases if anything this movie could have been longer hoping for director cut in the same manner as the justice league snydercut the material here is surprisingly dense and matt reeves does not waste your time in those three hours should watch this movie multiple times but the writing is tight with little to no plot holes from my memory it amazing so yes this is an epic experience this movie is excellent because it has so many characters and it takes time to develop and highlight those characters now understand the awful 90 minute cuts sometimes less most movies had to endure in past decades also shocked that it took this long for batman to go full film noir bruce wayne narrates parts of the film as private detective trying to find serial killer in gotham city it painfully apparent that the better batman stories are modern interpretations of old detective movies with amazing action every action sequence oozes off the screen as it expertly shot and executed it like the practical effects of the dark knight film from 2008 the crazy stunts car chases brutal real life combat yes this younger batman takes hits and barely gets back up at times because he physically and mentally battling against all the corruption of gotham in terms of the acting and character portrayals this surprised me the most wasn expecting bad acting but casting is essential for comic book movies glad to say the casting was done right and also convinced that films of this scale and caliber won accept bad actors anymore thankfully if you understand batman you won be disappointed1.0\tthis is the batman movie ve waited my whole life for finally detective finally that all have to say good actor chemistry good coherent storyline gritty gotham great adaptation of the comics it inspired by love it and would love more1.0\tprobably one of the best superhero movies ever made if not the best absolute treat for batman fans it doesnt feel like superhero movie and is more of thriller but it works regardless definetly one of the best movies that came out in the last years1.0\treally enjoyed this movie great acting score and the action sequences were incredible it felt realistic pattinson was ridiculously good maybe the best batman only have few cons it was slightly too long and didn like the last scene think they could have ended slightly differently and earlier1.0\tfor those who likes detectives and heros movies pretty sure that you ll enjoy this one lot the history has lot of details thus the movies is hours long robert pattinson gives to us disturbed vengeful and also batman that doens know how to measure his force the big difference from this movie for the nolan trilogy is that reeve sequence is more focused on batman you won see that bruce wayne who is rich or playboy you ll came across with bruce who doesn care for nothing but only revenge0.0\thard watch bomb of the year once the cant live with out batman crew move on with positive comments time will work against this film hours to tell that story why1.0\tthis is not superhero movie this is not cgi extravaganza with aliens and space ships this is dark crime solving drama that moves along at slower pace with character development and plot with good intermittent action scenes thoroughly enjoyed this not sure if most kids or pre teens will enjoy this did notice few younger kids in the audience getting antsy and being shushed by parents although the parents seemed to be engrossed very well acted hope this is not one off they lay the groundwork for future installments that will eagerly await1.0\twelcome new take on the city fresh masterpiece and tour de force performance from pattinson reeves has delivered something with totally unique identity0.0\tthe story is awful and adds stuff here that was never addressed ever in the comics or video games or other movies and doesn make sense no spoilers from me but the background for these characters are awful in this movie the pacing is also really bad way too long with characters being underused lot here the emo batman why does this dude have make up around his eyes it does not make him look cool also do not like how bruce wayne is portrayed it no difference there why is the riddler serial killer he criminal mastermind casting is terrible for some characters it also very boring not much going for it here1.0\tit has been so long since we experienced movie series first movie in this genre the batman captures it perfectly it brought back that feeling you had inside really worth spending your money0.0\tthe biggest question is why sure this goth emo batman is decent detective with good acting and passable action somehow when the line came up how all the corrupt people in gotham are white men it echoed through the entire movie yes every corrupt cop every crook every single villain in this movie is white male would not have noticed this if it weren for that damn line that brought everything in the forefront and made me groan and facepalm at the same time yes drastically lowering my score because of this if they want to preach they should find church1.0\tbelieve me you wont regret after watching this movie its like crazy super dark adventure and not just the herk that goddamn good but the villain to the riddler is crazy well written characters ive never seen the riddler goes like this we knew that riddler is goofy villain but in this movie he is creepy dark the soundtrack is amazing repeat more times because its makes me wonder how to be batman0.0\tno gadgets no charisma no connection weak storyline poor villain the riddler should probably be the smartest of all the batman villains but he isn corrupt officials in gotham with no background here is the thing for you if any reviews have rated this film and over my advice is to be very careful with other films they are rating high0.0\tthis just doesn hold up to batman of the past batman as sad depressing little weak man dark for this movie means depressing there was so much hype surrounding this movie just knew it was going to good can even stay interested so disappointing ugh where real man for batman he needs muscles1.0\tevery aspect of this movie was on point there are couple plot holes found also batman actor only felt meh especially during bruce wayne scenes where it didn feel like he gave us much personality but these aren very important nonetheless this was tense and mysterious movie the cinematography and music greatly matched the tone of this batman movie compared to the latest batman series like the batman better than batman begins and fraction better than the dark knight rises however the dark knight is still my favorite batman movie also the batman is one millionth of percent worse than the joker totally recommend that you watch this movie as soon as possible1.0\tam glad this movie wasn cgi clusterfart liked the fact this movie showed batman as detective he is however just found riddler to be whiny when he isn mysterious the music was pretty dope finally robert pattinson isn anymore remembered as that twilight sparkle vampire from twilight1.0\tthis was the best way that matt reeves had shaped batman ever the storytelling cinematography character development every aspects was overwhelming robert pattinson gave batman worthy performance robert and zoe brings life to comic accurate chemistry of the bat the cat about the part everyone will felt that movie is lengthy because it was build up to everything that holds gotham and batman together1.0\tthe movie was obnoxiously great the cinematography took my heart the music struck open my ears fell in love with this film being fan of the og batman this is the closest batman film we have ever seen it was an experience for me to watch this in theatres one demerit about the film is obviously it just bit long the conversations felt little long not bad it adjusted for me later but the movie could ve been 10 15min shorter but don mind it it fantastic and am waiting for the next one1.0\tthe batman is long movie but it worth it runtime it focuses more on the dark gritty detective aspect of the the character and is character study of the character of batman it is the greatest batman movie better than the dark knight and one of the best superhero movies of all time1.0\tthis is the batman film that ve been waiting for for yeeears everything about it was just so good and the run time really does fly by was shocked when the lights came on in the theater and realized it had been almost hour could barely notice1.0\tthis movie has different and interesting take on batman but wasted it potential the plot was so boring because it somehow manages to keep you uninterested in the mystery surrounding the riddler after some time into the movie and why does everyone walk so slow you can see batman walking so slow for every shot thought the bat suit was heavy and the third act is big let down poorly executed movie which could have been more on the bright side the cinematography the tone and the acting were all good1.0\tone of the best batman movies all times this is the real batman batman must to be detective in this movie like original comic book btw the cinematography is good the dop is good more story telling than fight this is perfect beginning for trilogy the batman pattinson and hope the next movie they make more good1.0\twent into this movie hearing it was good version of batman not great agree but it was not far from being great loved the detective side this movie has it had bit of gumshoe noir detective vibe which was awesome the little voice over at the beginning and it felt bit like raymond chandler was writing the script it had little drag here here and there and could have been about 20 minutes shorter wasn fan of riddler either and that is fine he was good enough to create formidable bad guy but maybe that is 50 years of comic lore playing into my opinion all of that aside found it very enjoyable and thought robert did fantastic job as batman and look forward to him in another film new justice league soft reboot recommend it if you haven seen it yet1.0\tdetective story story of hope this is truly thinking man woman kind of movie reminds me of seven the godfather part sin city and the french connection it has thrills mystery and at times horror0.0\tif it was some other superhero would give this movie stars for batman it is stars but just for the effects other aspects don exist no additional info is needed1.0\thappy to watch another new style of batman well done the casts plays their part well all character builts up nice although was expecting more actions more advance tech but we will getting more drama on this instead but nice to follow the story0.0\tthe amount of fake reviews in imdb is getting smart you can spot them putting perfect 10 and using flowery words when its obvious they haven seen the movie wonder how much they get paid coz want in this movie would have been great if it wasnt batman1.0\tif you re real fan this is the movie for you finally real life batman movie that goes into how batman should operate and be only thing wish he was little bigger pattinson would be better as nightwing or terry1.0\tthe batman is unlike any other batman movie we all have seen it takes the character in very deep and much personal way batman is not the world greatest detective or the legendary dark knight yet he in his early days he an amateur and the movie shows that in pretty good way he only cares about being batman his reputation doesn matter for him as bruce wayne he full of rage and hate he wants to be the nightmare of the criminals and he is fear is such big element in the movie gotham is broke and surrounded by corrupted people and batman wants to clean city that likes being dirty he can do it alone the soundtrack is phenomenal it fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the movie so the acting is robert pattinson displayed an amazing performance he gives that depressed full of rage bruce wayne in such spectacular way the batman is modern masterpiece1.0\tthe whole tema behind this movie did an wonderful job one may feel it hours long it will be sluggish but it nothing but the story builds up beautifully and the way robert pattinson portrays batman it completed different take and it so good zoe kravitz is the best catwoman and the chemistry between her and batman is just awesome the penguin is great and the riddler is awesome the best thing bout this is it completely grounded and comic accurate filled with long hollween and year refreance all in all its pure movie which martin scorsese would like1.0\tfinally masterpiece after so many movies that were disappointment enjoyed every second of it the play with the gloomy orange and red colours give special note throughout the whole movie the characters are fitted with the gloomy artwork where especially pattinson gave an amazing performance0.0\tcatwoman black gordon black getting really tiresome and joke that this has to be done for nearly every movie these days will stick to the bale batman movies1.0\tfirst joker then zack snyder justice league now the batman dc movies seem to make comeback with lengthy movies that have good plot and are very entertaining without giving away too much the movie has very interesting plot with brilliant actor as the villain was skeptic at first regarding this movie due to the numerous delays and wb implosion of dc but was pleasantly surprised this movie is worth watching1.0\tthe batman is an excellent movie that makes every comic book batman fan feel giddy lot of the characters felt almost undistinguishable from the comics selina finally feels like catwoman and not lady in leather costume with cat ears she also looks the part with her costume looking amazing her whip also gets some use in this film in cool ways zoe kravitz was very good fit for the role and she gave very good performance the only thing didn like was that privileged white men line as it felt too forced in movie already about corruption jeffrey wright was an amazing casting for the role of jim gordon although would ve liked to have seen him do bit more detective work without batman but he did feel like the character and he had very jim gordon vibe to him alfred was great in this movie although wanted to see bit more of him on screen although unconventional andy serkis was great cast for the role we we re also able to see lot of his detective work in this movie as well which really liked riddler actually felt menacing and pretty scary you could tell he was very deranged individual born from gotham corruption pattinson was an amazing casting choice for batman as he gave great performance he really shined through with his final scenes with the riddler and good part of his scenes with selina you can feel that he still only in year and isn the fully formed batman that you see in the comics nowadays the batsuit felt and looked like body armor and like it can actually block bullets where as the batfleck suit look way to rubbery and not safe yet it could stop bullet non the less but it is bit much when it can block machine gun bullets the movie is bit long but the pacing is great you can actually follow along with the stories mystery and upon some looking back at certain moments you can tell what going to happen at the end gotham here actually feels like gotham and not just like chicago which was to me very big problem in the dark knight trilogy the fight scenes were nice and fast paced you could feels the weight in every punch thrown the only advice have not to sit to close to the speakers since it very loud movie especially in the penguin chase scene penguin and falcone were bit underutilized but both of them were very comic book accurate and menacing can wait for the sequel whenever it comes out1.0\tgotta say went in to this movie after hearing bad reviews saying it was too woke or too long and not as good as the other ones this version of batman is definitely one of the best pattinson definitely crushed his performance of the cowled crusader being huge comic book nerd and having batman as my favorite superhero of all time this movie was stellar example of gritty eery and broken bruce wayne batman it was long but every second had me waiting to see what was next complete true detective film paul dano as the riddler was incredible new take to each of these characters that gave them true personality that we have never seen before actually think some of the scenes with batman interactions made me think of kevin conroys batman in the arkham series great movie do not listen to reviews despite it not being the best batman of all in my opinion it was great batman movie way better than afflecks actually think1.0\tafter 60 of the movie all my thoughts was toward thought when this butch if clishes will end bad casting great tortruro as falconi you got to be kidding me great pattinson as batman more like vampire not the batman like all actors but not the cast catwoman is fake best part she drinks milk penguin is the best scenario well all the accidents leads to the end many many jesus moments from the second stage actors talks lead us to the common end music love nirvana that it other tracks are forgettable just after saw it romance between is just so soap opera music changing in this moments to soap opera to length you are not nolan stop making santa barbara out of action movie didn like it at all don wanna see it ever again1.0\thaven seen it yet but give all movies see every star love batman and grew up on batman loved the animated series as kid this one looks like it fits right in batman is dark character and believe this is what we needed to see1.0\tso just got back from the local movie house and got say read lot of negative reviews about the length or the main characters being miscast or robert being to goth or emo some stupid and some relevant nitpicks didn have those issues and thought that robert was perfectly cast in the role initially wasn sure he could carry the nearly hour movie which felt benefited the movie greatly had it been any shorter it would have hurt the film being that there was so much going on it would have left you guessing or asking yourself questions the same issues that hurt the theatrical version of batman superman in the end robert succeeded in his efforts and made new fan in me and his portrayal thought all the other main characters were excellent in there performances too loved zoe kravitz as catwoman just sexy as hell and really enjoyed paul dano as the riddler thought he was very creepy and the darkest version of the character to date far cry from jim carrey performance and my favorite was colin ferrell as the penguin underneath all the fantastic prosthetic makeup just awesome lastly loved the batsuit and the new gadgets his masterful fighting prowess and of course the batmobile which was sleek and looked like muscle car on venom like bane also movie isn complete without the music which was beautifully done by michael giacchino overall it exceeded my expectations it was reminiscent of my favorite movie of all time blade runner that dark gritty neo noir style in rain so just like with anything you either love or you hate it and absolutely loved this excited for more1.0\tthis film is everything you want to see in batman film the action story theatrics acting score everything was so spot on had very high expectations and they were met plus some the world greatest detective is very much showcased here most superhero movies feel like your watching good movie this was an excellent film can really think of anything they could have done better it was gripping and awesomely gruesome the closest thing to perfection as it will likely ever get probably the best cinematic superhero movie ive ever seen nailed it out of 10 for me0.0\tlong rainy and wet with side of bat bruce doom and gloom not so long after matt reeves two planet if the apes films reeves has created world not nearly as engaging as the aforementioned movies pattinson bruce was written as non existent zombie no character is fully developed in this three hours snore fest how is that even possible1.0\tbecoming the new batman after the success of christian bale and ben aflack is no grand feat but feel that robert pattinson really performed the role well this movie was unnerving to me which was fantastic as all of batmans villans are sadistic and are supposed to make you feel that way zöe was good catwoman and feel they had some good chemistry that did not make the scenes of them two together feel awkward im really excited to see the upcoming films further progressing through the comics and feel this role could finally cleanse robert of his known twilight popularity1.0\tthe good really great reinvention reimagining with original ideas we haven seen this sort of gritty film noir detective take on the character in the cinema before really great performances by everyone if dceu batfleck was the battle worn older batman bat tinson is the young developing dark batman finding what he is supposed to be this is probably the most fallible batman he doesn save the day misses some critical evidence and makes mistakes at times this is more scary thriller than superhero movie the bad this is long film trying to untangle who is who in the criminal underworld and how they relate to each other got bit confusing there is lot of rain the poor cast and crew having to film in it it must have been nightmare liked it it tough job doing something new after so many batman films not as good as the dark knight but its very good piece of cinema1.0\tthis is very dark and gritty batman film the hour runtime started to feel long at about the hour mark the performances are good here from pattinson to kravitz to wright the entire cast does very good job but as said this is good batman movie not great one do not think it surpasses the dark night but it is very it is worth your time and money and will definitely watch this movie again and again check it out1.0\tthe batman 2022 this magnum opus of film managed to divulge the truth behind the 1980 comic books particularly the ones written by starlin and miller previously disregarded through film batman the comic book has intense psychological necessities like the murder of jason todd that had to be portrayed to shock readers into the purchase most preceding batman films whisper through the melancholy script grunge soundtrack dark cinematography and like recluse writer on park bench at midnight leave issues unresolved this near three hour film left nothing to the imagination except what criminal may appear in the sequel still to this day believe val kilmer made the best on screen portrayal of bruce wayne batman forever 1995 because anyone can put on suit and punch bad guys but not everyone can sharpen the true sword of batman his intense desire to be non violent and the massive amount of self doubt he has within based on his previous happenings the batman 2022 paid homage to all previous batman films including kilmer bruce wayne as well as directors with progressive modern landscape purposely set up to expose the mental issues of the caped crusader and the villains he set out to liberate or punish given the personal view of its watchers the batman 2022 took bits and pieces from each era of comic book and film and made this chef oeuvre of film from its research and findings 10 101.0\tthis is one of the best movies in recent times it shows batman as great detective the acting direction story music action scenes are all top notch1.0\tone of thee if not best batman we ve had truly captures the balance of the detective and combat aspects of batman know there criticism of not having the billionaire bruce wayne but it only year two he is slowly learning how to create the double life because it makes sense now to see that he didn just automatically know how to do that right away1.0\tthe direction for this new batman film took risk and have to say it paid off the script was amazing the scenes were action packed and clever the casting of robert pattinson as batman was perfect and he portrayed batman super well the writing for riddler the main villain in this film was absolutely genius this was different batman for sure but it was genius overall 101.0\tusually dislike all the superhero movies the marvel avenger types are getting old and usually seeing them only because friend wants too this movie really enjoyed it felt more like cop thriller and action movie with fun mystery to figure out than super hero movie gave me prisoners by denis villenueve vibes it was very dark and stylistic it was also shot so well every scene was interesting to look at and didn have that green screen feel it was very long but enjoyed seeing it in theatres around hours was feeling bit fatigued but it didn feel like the time was wasted and once the climax started forgot about how tired of sitting was would recommend seeing on the big screen0.0\tthere lot of worst packed into single movie worst alfred worst bruce wayne worst batmobile worst riddler worst head coverings both batman and catwoman worst multiple quasi endings worst batcave entrance goes down stairs with batcycle how doe the car get out worst riddles worst investigative talents worst weather the movie is hours and 47 minutes too long and to make it seem longer there is no humor at all1.0\tmatt reeves nailed it this the batman movie we were waiting for watched it in imax it was delight waited soo long robert pattinson nailed the batman role everything dark and gritty as the batman should everyone did phenomenon job vfx story cinematography everything was perfect can wait for more1.0\tfinally the dark knight has earned worthy partner at the top of the list of best batman movies the film may have one problem or another but overall it very good gotham finally seems to have the life it didn have in previous films and you understand how important it is in the story of both the hero and the villains heath ladger joker would love to have met paul dano riddler the movie is almost entirely night time it was very good batman for me is this it just doesn work during the day1.0\tthe film is masterpiece and it has been long time since saw such masterpiece first the way of filming is very good and interesting and your enthusiasm to complete the film and also the way of filming the fighting scenes is innovative and distinctive and secondly the music which played big role in arousing my enthusiasm among the scenes and entering you into an atmosphere the movie and your excitement in an unimaginable way and thirdly the characters and the acting batman which is played by robert pattinson it was perfect and wonderful literally the best batman have seen this is due to several reasons firstly because this movie delved into the character of batman or rather bruce wayne and his past and actor robert pattinson excelled in his performance of the character and the villain which is the riddler and his role is presented by the actor paul dano who was great although he did not show his face much but he is great and many actors also excelled and thank director matt reeves for providing the movie the story gotham city everything the film is masterpiece1.0\teveryone is going to ask is this the best batman film and people have asked me how it stacks up against the nolan trilogy well you can compare one film to films but in comparison to batman begins ll start by saying that the batman is superior in many ways it may lack the hero journey element but instead focuses on philosophy and the duality of batman the batman is very psychological the riddler is even more manipulative and insane than the joker in the dark knight there lot of philosophy in it regarding trauma pain fear and how those dark emotions affect actions and behavior my only wish is that we got more paul dano in this film my favorite parts of the film were when riddler and batman would engage in psychoanalysis batman villains were always darker versions of himself and riddler spends lots of time comparing himself to batman and almost seems to love him in weird stalker like way pattinson version of batman was written very well but can barely be considered cool nobody would want to be this batman he trusts nobody not even alfred he closed off from his emotions and guarded and think pattinson did great job making this batman it own even though he wasn the gruffest batman like bale was and affleck this batman had the genius intelligence of keaton batman but magnified by 10 pattinson batman is the smartest batman by far catwoman was played brilliantly by kravitz she such an amazing actor and was so happy that she had her own character driven story arc in the movie as did many other characters from alfred to carmine falcone who was played brilliantly by john turturro the penguin as well as alfred didn have much screen time but thought colin farrell put ton of energy into the performance as did serkis who had very great emotional scene in this film would absolutely watch this film all over again the very same day despite being hours long yes it could ve been 15 20 minutes shorter but never had an issue remaining glued to the screen would even look forward to the rumored hour cut while this isn perfect film due to the lack of the hero journey element lack of action scenes and the lack of emotion serving the plot the batman still manages to captivate for its complex character studies and the amazing visual cinematic prowess of matt reeves1.0\tsaw the batman today and allow me to tell you that it the best batman since tdkr let start with the positives the story is quite powerful although the movie is long but it isn any boring the direction is very good the action scenes are well made the movie is violent that disadvantage too michael giacchino score reminded be bit with danny elfman theme cinematography by greig fraser is astonishing robert pattinson killed the role and is the best choice since christian bale pattinson knew how to play psychopathic version of batman unlike affleck who comes behind both bale and pattinson no one stole the scenes because every actor nailed their part and mean every actor afraid paul dano is real psychopath and acting normality his role is similar to his role in prisoners it great to know that not only heath ledger can make villain that isn forgettable batman is so realistic here as the movie doesn have many cgi scenes like how they destroyed gotham this time every time they try to blow the city or drive the people crazy now with the only disadvantage that found in this movie the rating could have been restricted and we would have got more violent scenes riddler scenes are so violent but unfortunately no blood at the end the movie is nearly perfect and hope we get more sequels with pattinson and reeves note try to see the movie in weekend and not in working day as it requires some concentration hope you have good time as had1.0\there what think happened someone with lot of extra time began writing bit of batman fan fiction couldn stop kept going on and on but somehow wound up writing good batman movie scratch that very good batman movie bit overly dark it as if the producers saw the intensity of the nolan trilogy and said hold my beer but compelling sprawling story with turn after turn that miraculously doesn feel too long despite hour runtime it such good movie that wrote my first imdb review in well over decade after seeing it1.0\tdon typically look at superhero movies or movies in general based on how well adapted they are from the comics look at them as stand alone narratives the dark knight trilogy was amazing for that very reason it was just great movie in and of itself and can be appreciated whether you re comic fan or not when first saw the trailer was skeptical given dc reputation for making childish tween and poorly executed movies but when saw that matt reeves was involved had bit of hope personally loved bunch of movies he was involved in either as writer producer or director including 10 cloverfield lane and all the planet of the apes they were well executed movies when saw the film the introduction was intriguing and the way they introduced the batman slowly and in that aggressive way was really well done the cinematography and the methodical detective like approach was very nice and the actions and dialogue of the characters were all very realistic and mature little effort was made to insert cheesy humour or childish banter it was all pretty serious and the director knew what tone he wanted to set it didn try to fit into all categories at once overall as narrative would still rank the dark knight trilogy as the goat but this is definitely highly respectable film and probably the only good thing dc has done aside from the recent joker film1.0\tthe movie itself is alright but did you really need to stretch it to almost hours without the hype it nice emo vibes batman movie like the vibe but all could ve been done in hours time max0.0\tmovie was so slow and boring half the cinema walked out the story line drags on very slow pace movie lacks connection with any characters overall movie is boring and is waster of money to watch1.0\tthe batman is very good movie but can help but notice the identitarism instilled to continue the brainwashing the villains are all white the only one in the gang who has doubts is black the mayor who will unite the city is black and it can be also explicit like when catwoman says those rich old white men deserved what happened to them other than that the film is well acted and very well directed it has few flaws in the script and it loses its breath at the very end it was worth going to the cinema after so long0.0\tfantasy pizza with all the cliches niksu it been couple weeks since saw this exhaustingly long film in theatre almost left after 30 minutes don get the hype at all1.0\trob is fantastic batman really sad and depressing going through some dark stuff it proper cat and mouse detective story comically accurate action scenes are brutal tech is amazing hands down best batman so far and big bale and batfleck fan1.0\tthis was just an incredible masterclass of detective batman in his early days it was nice to have batman who struggled with his identity of bruce wayne and really through himself into batman 95 of the movie was him as batman and love that casting was spot on and proved me wrong wasn sure on the pattison casting but that was blown away by the first trailer and first scene in the movie paul dano was superb as the riddler very dark gillian compared to what we have seen in the past colin farrell brilliant falcone brilliant gordon brilliant for me no faults just masterpiece1.0\tthis was solid movie but so much of it was unnecessary the whole catwoman plot line could have been left out and would ve easily saved viewers an extra hour1.0\tfinally perfect detective story worthy of the world greatest detective all the performances were great the action sequences were top notch in my personal opinion rate this higher than the dark knight1.0\tfirst of all this cannot be labelled as superhero movie its all human his emotions his fear his tension everything that any normal person would feel wonderfully crafted movie with robert pattinson solid acting the moment saw the movie felt it as classic film noir piercing into the darkest emotions of bruce wayne and the characterization of catgirl was brilliant and believing when the film ended it was not just the batman but also the catgirl remained in the heart has this movie been made more raw and aimed for an rating it would have been masterpiece hope the makers should consider rating in its sequel1.0\teverything about this movie was just absolutely perfect and well curated for batman movie it was dark brooding aesthetic violent and everything you could want from batman movie zoe kravitz was absolutely perfect as catwoman and can wait to see more of her she had great chemistry with rob pattinson1.0\tim not sure if the reason im not feeling this movie is beacuse im comparing too much to the dark knight triology the film is approximately hours long and felt done hour in the movie is far from bad but its just nothing special really the villian felt super off to the story and the scenes were just boring bealive its overall overrated1.0\twith its captivating plot and well thought out antagonist the batman checks all the right boxes even including sneak peek to the next movies villain dc fans finally get an accurate depiction of gotham and new cat woman which hasn been done in 30 years this movie is well written with great cinematography and dialogue overall perfect 10 for comic book movie which delivered on every aspect this movie will not disappoint0.0\tbatman used to be my favorite hero but after watching this garbage it kinda ruined it for me it was like they didn like batman for some reason they had to ruin good hero1.0\tthe first thing that moves me to theater is the good actors while was not sure about pattinson playing batman and bruce wayne can say that he fits well and performed superbly liked the sounds effects so much the soundtrack the darker dark theme and the feeling that lot of things are happening at once in intense scenes there is no single character in the movie without being greatly involved in the story and the drama surrounding it everybody looks like gotham local and they are all affecting on each other and connected to the events in this great city not 10 10 giver and put this in between to but will be grateful for the efforts in the movie and close it on 100.0\tthe new cinematography process strikes again another walking dead or got type filming effort to make us the viewer feel like the character is in the dark we know the scene is at night raining or foggy but why shouldn we as the viewer be able to actually see the movie why are we constantly guessing what we think is happening aside from that this film was okay but please stop comparing it to any one of the nolan bale movies it not even close to batman begins it just not it no secret dc has been struggling since the nolan films and as of recent has worked to rebrand their comic to film efforts was true dc especially batman comic collector marvel was not my go to for good read unfortunately dc has had lot of trouble doing what marvel has done in taking some mid range characters and making them household names let face it ironman wasn the marvels main hero not even close yet tony stark shoulders is the one now that the entire marvel brand stands on and they just keep going truly hope dc can figure it out soon because they have great characters to work with and can make them all fit together in one world isn that the thing now anyway this film just didn do it for me1.0\twas bit skeptical at first but all can say is can wait to see more of this batman this dude is unlike batman of old no fancy high tech gear to help him fight those hands he puts on yah is just epic beat down1.0\tfirst off like other reviews may say this batman film is not for kids frankly don know how it only pg 13 but that not complaint the movie is far out the acting the script the plot the soundtrack the cinematography the symbolism you can glean due to the cinematography the overall art design the cast they re all amazing the characters including batman feel so surprisingly human and alive which only pulls you in even more seriously it must watch1.0\tthis film shows one of the best adaptations of graphic novel into live action that ever seen this batman could exist in real life the atmosphere of this movie is somber as it should be1.0\tpattinson portrayal as the caped crusader is phenomenal that it proves to be one of the best renditions to date but it was paul dano who knocked it out of the park with his terrifying performance as the riddler another reason to love this film is its beautiful cinematography the dark atmosphere sets in the mood and paints the character of batman and above all we get to see batman as detective which makes the storyline even greater1.0\tthis film is hour love letter to the character of batman and his transformation from vigilante to the caped crusader superhero that we all love however have seen some reviews from people expecting the light hearted fun comedic short stories of marvel which this is not firstly it dc and it batman don expect it to be suitable for kids secondly it not slow it is paced out perfectly and it not too long endgame was slightly longer than this but no you all loved it because its marvel don hate on something because it different this film is better than all mcu releases and on the same level as no way home don hate dc it frustrating to see hate from people who don understand the material of what they re watching1.0\tjust watched the movie the movie is too good the story line is awesome one if the best superhero and detective movies made soo far thanks to matt reeves and rob pattinson and entire cast for giving us such movie1.0\tmovie was absolutely terrific batman plotted as accurate comic first time we get batman theme in while and all star cast were incredible also bgm played vital role in whole movie1.0\tit the batman omg the batman is more that all anticipation we have bind it brings comic batman to cinema and is the darkest version so far we feel attached to him with all characters throughout the movie was like not blink may miss something just want the second part asap what great work by robert pattinson zoë kravitz matt reeves and each and every person batmanforever1.0\tfirst of all it long there were times when was tempted to get my phone out and check the time usually don put watch on the riddler becomes serial killer the batman is treated as suspicious and vigilante except by lt gordon there woman with cats although never called catwoman that who she seems to be there hint of romance the message of the film seems to be that everyone in gotham is corrupt nobody said build back better but bet they were thinking it so without giving anything away it could be shorter it could take itself less seriously and there could be more action but it was enjoyable1.0\tthis movie is fantastic batman showed the detective the best riedler was fantastic soundtrack the filming and screenplay was the best of its kind he showed the villain and the hero in the best way love her or him1.0\tll admit that haven seen the previous batman films since had no reasons to do so not being fan of superhero movies want attracted me to the batman was its noir nature to this extent was satisfied the batman is about the title hero robert pattinson who acts as vigilante in gotham city and punishes criminals for vengeance he meets catwoman zoë krawitz and together they set on to unmask the riddler satanic villain terrorising the city elite by murdering some of its members in the course of his quest the batman gets involved in the world of crime and uncovers many facts about his identity and his family past the director did an excellent job in this film using fast paced takes to keep it going and make it enjoyable despite its three hour duration his use of location was also fantastic with him showing up the viewers the slums of gotham as well as the mansions of the elite the actors all gave exquisite performances pattinson was amazing as the batman offering stoic portrayal of the hero who cares about his friends catwoman and his butler alfred and despises his enemies in this case the riddler his performance was one of emotional intensity especially in the scenes where he learns about his father past zoë krawitz was also enjoyable to see interpreting the catwoman with vibrancy and seductiveness her and pattinson made great pair the music made no particular impression to me it orchestral instrumentals sounding bit old fashioned and too pompous for such grim film what was of interest to me about the movie was its portrayal of the modern superhero the modern world doesn need superhumans it needs relatable individuals who just possess trait that differentiates them from the mass their power is based on their intelligence not their charm or physical strength this change is also seen in other franchises like james bond who transformed from seductive womaniser with impeccable style to vulnerable human who gets through with the help of team his brain and his gadgets gone is the old style of the superhero made for times of post war anxiety now the hero must be one of us if bit different in conclusion while not generally enjoying superhero movies found this take on the batman interesting intriguing and promising its being an acclaimed work that also enjoys commercial success shows its true power to appeal to everyone from the experienced critic to the average viewer and for this it is commendable1.0\tcharacter faithful to the comic book impressive scenes masterful camera angles good action sequences it good show that should definitely be watched0.0\tbats live in caves caves are dark and sounds confusing from distorted echoes bats hear frequencies we can nice touch maybe if this had never been done before instead literal interpretation of this batfilm left me so bored that can not tell anything about the screenplay who was in it or how well it may have been done am deathly sick of too dark films and flix which strain the eyes just to figure out what is happening period that was so over year or more ago am equally sick of horrible sound production styles that have songs and special effects pounding your ears but dialogue output at half or lower normal listening volume as if the fricatives and sibilants have been dulled by compression filters to the same qualities as indistinctly enunciated vowels patinson may or may not be okay as anything but vampire but it ll have to wait until some other critic favored movie shows up with him in it so far he has almost no personality on screen and barely any mystique this time he practices sotto voce to the exclusion of anything else was able to see which was next to nothing as usual the soundtrack was 4x too loud compared to the dialogue so headache ensued in my expensive comfy theater long before anything else and left within 25 30 minutes walked out and felt much better thanks marvel allowance of this travesty theatrical release as is on the heels of the equally but differently disastrous shang chi has me wondering if kevin has lost his mind soul and or body avoid the theater for this hour plus the junk preceding and wait if you must see it at all for eventual streaming video it worth no more than 99 hd rental on amazon1.0\tll keep this review short and sweet pattinson is my favorite batman while the nolan trilogy is amazing often felt like batman was overshadowed by other characters but this not the case here the supporting cast is impeccable yet this batman shines because he has the gravitas of bale and the physicality of affleck yet pattinson doesn over it and keeps it simple bringing darker tone to his performance the cinematography is stunning so many great shots colors and composition are just amazing you can see the effort that was put into it the score as well dark somber familiar yet refreshing to me this is the closest live action adaptation got that resembles the animated series which to me is the definitive representation of batman1.0\temo bruce wayne had me acting up the entire runtime lol marvel fans seething not seeing little fat sidekick character cracking joke every millisecond1.0\trated 10 language english another version of dark knight lot of scenes reminds me of the nolan one was expecting more action and better riddles but it was ended as more of conversation less action and more american riddles the length of the movie is real pain and felt bored in the middle one time watchable for the craze of batman1.0\tevery character was on point unlike other batman movies where they only focus on the wealth of bruce or his playboy side and high tech gadgets this movie has focused on the more important aspects the dark detective movie we all wanted to see no bc just truly batman work the transition of him being vengeance to hope the transition of bruce from self pity to price it was amazing how they show gotham accepting him as symbol of hope the first scene gave me chills the fear of people towards the dark knight amazing story amazing cast amazing art acting kudos to matt reeves1.0\tthis batman moive actually too dark than thought can believe it 13 and the new actor of batman not bros wayne is not that bad and bors wayne is soo much cool and the vilan is actually good so much than thought umm don have lot of things1.0\tthis movie was really good robert pattinson was pretty good as batman and kravitz did well to make catwoman lot more likeable and relatable compared to other renditions of catwoman in the past the movie is shot really well and paced so well that hour movie feels like hours my only thing that wanted more from the movie is paul dano liked his performance but just wanted more screen time for him but that my only critique and this movie did good for batman0.0\twould have been great if they kept politics out the white privilege line made me get up and walk out garbage white privilege doesn exist so guess it fits in make believe movie but still ruins the experience have been diehard dc fan my whole life and batman was always my favorite character dc lost fan when they added that political garbage1.0\tthis era is definitely darker better and more delight from the script transition and story wise there is no much to complain however the music is little bit overdo making me shifting my focus to background music than the actual dialogue cheers to pattinson for agreeing in this trilogy1.0\tfinally great batman movie again great pacing beautifully shot pattinson is good young edgy batman and above all this batman film is different from the others it takes new look at the story we all know and the early batman finding his way really is fresh take0.0\twent to the cinema to see this movie it totally lost my interests in the first hour and made me wanna leave but went with my partner so have to sit through the whole movie don get me wrong like dc marvel superhero and thrilling movie the storyline is just boring and super long all can say it was long night for me have never seen the movie from dc or marvel that makes me want to leave before think they made it1.0\tthe cinematography is 10 10 all the story is magnificent really like this movie the riddler is fantastic original villian this is the best batman movie since the dark knight1.0\tdon think everyone likes this film because this film is too dark unlike other superhero films matt revees here is very genius scoring and the cinematics are very good and beautifull the audience is brought slowly to follow the puzzles in the film this film is like combination of se7en zodiac and johnwick 10 10 masterpiece0.0\tthis is not batman movie it man in cape detective movie very long and boring of course there are swipes at white people as is common from hollywood catwoman refers to white privilege twice in the movie so glad downloaded it rather than wasting time and money at the cinema1.0\twe ve both just walked out of the cinema in complete disbelief at the movie we ve just watched movie of the year so far and think it going to be hard to top it best batman movie since the dark knight and probably the best batman movie of all the ones that came before clocking in at hours we were hooked from the get go and didn move from the edge of our seats an almost faultless movie that could watch again and again 10 the only reason it not 10 10 is because the dark knight exists also out of all the batmobiles we ve ever seen on screen want robert pattinson one the most0.0\tit was ok great visuals but super dark though pattinson was ok for the batman role but batman should know how to get out of these situations doesn let hostages die he already should know oh it inigma behind the riddler then be able to pin point him before he harms any more innocent people batman needs to be quick whit and gadget friendly1.0\tsee that there are people here saying that it better than the dark knights ve seen lot of absurd things ve seen but this is the peak the movie but it has several flaws especially in the villains it looks like this is movie of catwoman not batman1.0\twasn pleased when pattinson was cast much like ben affleck just struggle to get past how good christian bale was but take it back rp smashed it very convincing batman the riddlr paul dano steals the show for me tho with the most sinister riddler yet colin farrell is unrecognisable as the penguin and john torturro is scary falcone hope they can build on this1.0\tplus on this movie really liked the dark tone and story building noir vibe is very intense and it reasembles the watchmen the only small let down is the villain1.0\tafter nolan realistic approach never thought we could get different look for the cape crusader but here it is the movie belongs so much to the great stories in the comics and people are right to point how heavily influenced it is from the movie seven best movie of the year so far1.0\tthis movie completely lived up to the hype was hoping this would turn into the next dark knight trilogy and it looks like that the way it headed reeves shot this movie perfectly every shot was beautiful the cast was perfect pattinson nailed the character as well as kravitz farrell and wright let not forget dano performance as the riddler he nailed it with his psychotic take on the character this movie to me is the perfect combination of nolan grounded approach as well as burtons dark and gritty appearance can wait to see what next1.0\tif you like the comic book batman you will find this movie familiar this movie should not be compared to the dark knight movies since both are different in their individual ways including differences in story and character development the dark knight movies are cinematically dazzling but the batman is more accurate in portraying batman as his true self1.0\tmatt reeves the batman is strangely satisfying curiosity here we have story about an angry man wearing an impenetrable suit that allows him to co exist with the creeps and criminals of gotham but the story is also about man who has to rely on his powers of deduction in absence of violence and this is where the batman sometimes unwisely plants its focus there is very little action in this film and never scene to cheer for batman in this movie is just angry rich kid who wants to clean up the streets no league of shadows backstory no life changing encounter with flock of bats pattinson batman likely learned what little fighting technique he has from youtube he built his suit to take lots of punches and bullets he drives muscle car he squabbles with the cops who openly throw him shade and consorts with the seedy underbelly in night clubs the batman is regular guy who has just enough advantages to get by but not enough to outright win this makes him instantly recognizable as person and gives the movie amazing presence but it also makes the movie so grounded that it subject matter becomes mostly satire the riddler serial killer arc really goes nowhere and batman fights the mob again this movie is basically batman begins without any of the heroic grandeur with pattinson being the best batman ever in the least dangerous situation batman has ever faced the last hour is basically spoof of the nolen movies and the ending is full on cringe yet couldn take my eyes away pattinson very human batman carries the film through its gorgeous scenery and moody atmosphere it character study not batman film but it succeeds enough to be worth watch1.0\tforgot this movie was pg 13 when watched it due to the tone it has it edgy as hell but it doesn overdo it to the point that it slog the soundtrack really stands out in this movie as it adds to the dark edgy tone the movie takes it isn your average superhero movie this one takes it time and plays to it own drum1.0\tthat saying lot because really liked the dark knight but didn care for the second part of the trilogy so much because they could have gone way farther with it mean the dark knight rises was good and all but it wasn as memorable as the dark knight so after seeing the ben affleck movies thought they went down the drain is that bad anyway was as skeptical about the robert pattinson casting as anyone else but he brought everything to the table maybe even more than bale did with his trilogy1.0\tits an amazing movie with fantastic scenes and action it opens whole new world for the batman character the movie was way above my expectations and im glad saw it before most people loved it and this will go down as the best batman movie for now1.0\twant to emphasise on reboot for films that can only achieve success in out of 10 reboot films considering popular titles like independence day terminator transformers etc which didn do well we have seen such reboot failures but not for the batman am very big fan of christian bales batman movies scared to see this fail but this movie was excellent very happy1.0\tthe best live action batman movie so far was little worried about robert patterson as batman but he knocked it out of the park the riddler is good villain0.0\tthis movie is painful to watch poor actuation and characterization the director should have listened to the fans and the story plot boring and some times out of topic1.0\texcellent superhero movie the story of the movie was good robert pattinson acting was excellent zoë kravitz acting was good but didn like catwoman paul dano acting was great and he was the best actor in the movie don like bruce wayne recommend watching it1.0\tmany critics and people for not having good reason to comment badly say that the film is dark which think is the most ridiculous opinion to lower the rating of the film1.0\tit for the best that didn actually happen because robert pattinson wasn yet ready to play this part and because people would be saying the batman was the definitive version and we probably sadly wouldn have ever gotten the nolan interpretations the look and visual composition of this film is not like anything matt reeves has done before and if you re going to be influenced by two directors for movie like this the proyas and fincher combo is wise one to be inspired by sure reeves has other influences showing up here but those were the two that were obvious to me the editing was exceptionally lucid for most of the film though did find some of the climactic action at the end to be somewhat numbing and boring compared to sequences early in the film not sure if that was me or the film had the same reaction to some but not all of the action at the end of the nolan films final acts which thought never quite lived up to their first two acts the final act of the batman was on the whole arguably better than any the nolan films achieved in my opinion but not so much because of the action the editing is complimented by some wonderfully interesting shot choices which are further complicated by the creative use of narrow focal planes vignette blurring where only the center is clear occasionally entirely soft focus shots and contrasted with very sharp wide angle views of the entire city might these choices be somewhat calling attention to themselves and thus distracting us from being lost in the film perhaps some of the music has similar effect and would personally not have used that one song in the trailers like they did which resulted in it losing some of its novelty within the narrative but it all still very interesting and you can stop paying attention to these shots or the music even if they stand out so this is all double edged sword in 4k on brighter screen that not too outrageously huge and with state of the art sound this was one of best looking and sounding digital presentations ve seen it can have the clarity or vibrance of the best of real film with the best accompanying projections and auditoriums yet in some shots but these filmmakers are embracing what digital can offer and exploiting digital strengths well while the action and gunfight scenes were extremely dynamic the dialogue and ambience were not overly compressed for exaggerated loudness like nolan recent movies the different frequency bands across the mix further had some room to breathe within the space speech was highly intelligible and the overall sound retained its subtlety and delicacy too these folks did the sound right here the complexity of the frame and the choices in surround sound made this film spread out in way think people are going to find difficult replicating at home if you have any interest in the batman then find good theater and don lose chance to see it during its run if had to give one complaint though it that didn feel the relationship between alfred and bruce was developed enough it seemed forced and like the audience buying into it was just taken for granted they could have treated this as the only batman movie that had ever been made instead of assuming we ve seen all the others and understand these two better than is presented here ll probably see it again and decide further if that still my take0.0\tthe film is to dark and the acting is terrible far too many arty shots and the film could have been cut shorter me and my friend walked out of the film after an hour as both of us decided we could not sit through another two hours1.0\tdc has another breakout powerhouse went into this movie with low expectations was more than pleasantly surprised you can feel the passion of everyone involved in this detective movie it does leave me wondering how heroes like superman would fit in without feeling completely wrong for this world it felt very rooted in reality my biggest criticism is that it was tad too long however trying to figure out what points would be worth leaving out and still provide everything we got it definitely must see for fans be prepared it is slower more thoughtful approach to batman this makes the action scenes land harder than marvel action fest think batman the animated series meets the long halloween1.0\tdon really put reviews unless really into the character but this movie blew my mind wasn even batman fan but robert pattinson did such great job playing the character if you re going to watch this movie don compare it with tdk its really different and both are super good in their own way1.0\tabsolutely loved this movie realistic portrayal of batman and gotham city as well amazing performance all around as well can wait to see more of robert pattison batman in the future1.0\tmy new favorite batman movie so dark and gritty loved it pattinson is amazing as the batman wasn so sure at first when he was casted but he is perfect loved his dark brooding version of the character the acting from all the cast was quite stellar collin was completely unrecognizable as the penguin paul dano was just scary as the riddler honestly any review less than rating should be ignored the music score cinematography story acting etc was outstanding the nirvana song was the right match and loved how they started and ended with it love that this batman had more realistic quality right down to the black eye makeup very haunting movie that just stays with you when it done some of the action scenes were intense and just beautiful so damn impressed with this version didn think anything could beat the dark knight series and truthfully this didn it completely different and love the direction it took because it doesn compete with that series because it feels entirely something new it allows you to still appreciate any previous iteration and love this one separately can wait to watch it again0.0\tthis movie was absolutely awful shouldn be hours long and didn even finish it turned that crap off how did it get such good ratings apparently lot of people don know what good movie is yuck1.0\tpattinson is an excellent brooding hero and his performance was top notch kravitz was excellent as well dano performance stole the show turturro was great as usual we needed more bruce alfred interaction feel the directing while not bad could ve taken better turn really long movie could ve been better in less time0.0\tthe movie overall was dull and boring you never felt in touch with the batman or any other character he was behaving like depressed person the plot was generic the acting was okay at best the movie never explained why and how bruce wayne became the batman how he created the suit where he found his equipment etc if you haven watched previous batman films or read the comics then you would know nothing about batman backstory robert pattinson didn fit the role of batman don think he was good he kept pale face the entire movie any actor could have done that the difficult part is to show emotion which he didn do1.0\tquite great adventure perfect movie to see in the theater saw it in imax and it blew me away loved the grittyness and how it is different than all the marvel movies good to have some variety in cinema these days and this is unique vision and angle on the franchise actors were all quite strong and the direction and style were great only real complaint was the dialogue so many of gordon and batman lines were just like one liner saying something like oh what does that mean or what is that about both of them seemed so confused for much of the movie pattinson did really solid job but he did seem sort of confused for many parts of the movie say that is on the script and direction so that could have been better wasn sure about john turturro but he ended up doing ok few odd moments here and there the way that batman sort of rescued some of the people near the end of the film was odd still ended up loving it if you are at all fan of batman then say it must see in the theater especially won be as powerful at home for sure enjoy it1.0\tok so lot of people are gonna expect some marvel action or some fantasy bullcrap you have to understand this is detective triller movie which is what batman is about even tho it basically hours long it keeps you going didn get bored if your true batman fan you ll love this movie and more if you like detective triller movies robert pattinson to me is the best batman voice look feel 10 10 to be honest didn care for he take on bruce wayne tho and he needs to put atleast 15 to 20 pounds of muscle haha0.0\tdont expect to watch anything close to batman movie the batman actor poses he does not act he poses for the girls of the twilight still slow motion movie to entertain depressed patients of sigmud froyd in gloomy dark room in the 1900s before he electrifies them no smart scenario no lines game of badminton far more interesting and spirited no gadgets no sci fi aspects no mythology its class dvd noir pink panther with batman wings movie and unfortunately its not even parody its tragedy for all batman fans0.0\tworst thing is that the hans zimmer music is gone instead you get one of the most annoying soundtrack ever made mr pattinson is not as bad as val kilmer but his bruce wayne is weak somehow you think that he is more vampire than superhero there are many lengthy scenes that do not add absolutely anything you just loosing 170 minutes of your live and pray for the remote to fast forward1.0\tokay in my opinion this movie could have been anywhere from half hour to hour shorter and told the same exact story while ll admit loved the movie and didn want it to end hrs is just too long for batman movie understand it was deep and stuff like that but it was way too long though ll say highly recommend it just maybe he some extra snacks and be sure to leave the kids at home for this one1.0\tthe batman now when you attach bat to human name it initially attracts curiosity more accurately mockery people tend to take it lightly but when every night man dons suit symbolising bat runs through city to eradicate the filthiest of crimes in the most horrific ways possible ways which are darker than the crimes itself it attracts fear he can be everywhere because the city is large but the city doesn know that so crime starts to live in fear he starts making difference but on this journey of ending darkness with more darkness the man behind the mask keeps getting scarred internally he starts drowning into his own dark path of justice untill he realizes that he stands for something much greater than what he thought he did hope cinematography acting background music stunt choreography screenplay direction all sum up to give pioneer experience its must watch film then again its not for everyone don buy tickets if you are normie when it comes to cinema1.0\tthe batman made us excited like fanboys meeting their favorite star for the first time we weren having high expectations because the past batman movies are okay feeling like typical superhero show but hold on there the movie is great robert pattinson is great choice for the movie despite what naysayers said months too much hate for twillight before the movie is release you can feel the conflict the soul of the characters he portrayed the young depressed vengeful disheveled disarranged bruce wayne well we can see how he is in denial with himself being batman and bruce at the same time being newly orphan the acting is on point when you wanted to go into the movie to assuage the character you know the actor is doing amazing job those reviews complaining about him being not charismatic and lackluster bruce is not getting the point he is supposed to play as mess and lackluster depressed dude that is coping with his parent recent death christian bale bruce or ben affleck bruce are supposed to be the later years bruce which is matured and moved on from the death of his parents all need to read your batman history these toxic boys need to move on from their hatred for twilight edward cullen the cinematography is amazing it makes you wanted to explore the places too the plot keeps you on your toes and wanting more it make us feeling like we are the main character in the rpg game everything feels realistic you can feel the human side of batman you can see him doing things and struggle as human hero unlike previous batman movies that cheesy or extra it must watch1.0\tthe cinematography and the scoring were on point there were some scenes that made me gave all my attention to the movie just because of how intense the scenes were despite the cinema experience agree this movie was too long because of the slow character movement in some scenes1.0\tthe batman was film worth awarding above rating stars couldn fault it it is riveting and raw with magical appeal and an endearing charm don like the genre usually but was so taken aback by the beauty of this film that felt it deserved five stars1.0\ttoo dark and too long not match to nolan or burton movie pattinson was good but the best acting was from the riddle in my opinion not single scene on daylight is too much and too dark for my taste yes know that batman must be dark but come on now it like that there is no day in gotham1.0\tjust got out of the movie theater having watched this movie and have to say this is by far the absolute best portrayal of the batman that ve seen in my 45 years on this earth the whole brooding theme of the movie reminded me strongly of the joker movie would rate both this movie and that movie as worthy of almost the same space although the joker would come out on top for me because of joaquin phoenix outstanding performance he is by far the only actor who could ever be my joker however having said that wanted to rate the batman as 10 but it lost one point for me during the movie without giving any spoilers they cast an actor called barry keoghan the batman movie feels like it strongly came out of the telltale universe so for me the only person that will ever fill that particular role as telltale character would be anthony ingruber hopefully if this turns into trilogy then that character can be recast and anthony ingruber offered the role1.0\tthis is in my opinion the best batman everything was correct the noir the darkness the acting and the vilian paul dano steals the show impressive film easily on par with dark knight if not better0.0\tbatman looked and acted like he was broke dock worker how they depicted alfred was unforgivable the cinematography was terrible with some scenes so dark you couldn even tell what you were looking at it took us 20 minutes to figure out the villain was the riddler it was boring to the point we started to get sleepy and they must have spent lot of the music score budget on that nirvana song because the score was basically non existent after that1.0\twhat movie had to watch it twice after my first viewing didn know how felt so waited week and watched it again and came to the conclusion it the best batman movie ever made might be the best cbm ever made every actor killed it especially penguin and bats the score was absolutely amazing that car chase directing and cinematography were gorgeous the score and cinematography are what gives this the edge over the dark knight imo0.0\thours omg soooo long for what nothing exciting going on always the same stuff over and over and everything soooo loooonnng cant say anything bad about the production that was amazing but noooooooo want my hours of my day back please1.0\tthis was everything that batman noir fan can dream about absolutely loved how matt reeves used the noir genre in the batman to full effect and to perfection it was easily one of the greatest movies have ever seen and probably the second best batman movie of all time just beating batman begins and right behind the dark knight matt reeves brought to life the perfect bruce wayne maybe even better than nolan bruce wayne this was nocturnal year two bruce wayne one who was so used to being the batman he forgot who bruce wayne really was the performances were all brilliant with pattinson being the standout and jeffrey wright zoe kravitz paul dano almost stealing the show robert pattinson may even go on to defeat the great christian bale depending on how the next few movies go1.0\tthe batman was one of my most anticipated of 2022 with stellar cast knew the performances would be amazing but god was surprised the movie shows the true essence of batman millionaire who fed up of the systematic corruption that had consumed gotham for decades and had also taken his parents from him loved ho matt reeves focused more on the story and the aesthetics here rather than focusing on senseless cgi that we see in every other superhero movie nowadays not saying not fan of those superhero movies but this movie is truly diamond in the rough1.0\tportraying batman as masked vigilante rather than an invincible superhero is gusty call in the age of superhero movies where protagonists perform ungodly feats with impossible tech in out of the world vistas matt reeves managed to sell batman as possible superhero that is the idea behind batman originally an intelligent strong human being who goes around fighting crime without any supernatural powers the cast was pretty well chosen they couldn have pulled this off otherwise robert pattinson is talented actor was pleasantly surprised by his performance in tenet walked into the theater expecting great performance and wasn disappointed paul dano and john turturro were brilliant colin farrell make up and acting was excellent didn know that colin farrell was in the movie until after the movie feel so smart right now enjoyed the movie thoroughly1.0\tcompletely blown away about how good this film is it its own version of batman it doesn try to copy the epic christian bale batman it just did its own version and loved it1.0\twanted to dislike the batman but cannot it was pretty good movie well told and well performed wanted to dislike it because in general dc movies have lacked that something that made marvel movies so good wanted to dislike it because thought robert pattinson would make poor batman bruce wayne wanted to dislike it because zoe kravitz as catwoman just did not seem more than publicity woke stunt wanted to dislike it because was expecting more woke propaganda was wrong and am glad that was first this is not superhero movie it is not horror movie or much of detective movie because the riddler signs things from the start although you do not know who he is it is not movie that is easy to stuff into genre because it is all of those things and none of them this batman has no super friends helping him and uses very few gadgets his batcave is more like garage not high tech headquarters this is early in this batman career and he is still very angry and as he says at the start motivated by vengeance if there was genre called vengeance that is probably the best genre for this movie since almost every main character has vengeance on his her mind robert pattinson made very good batman was wrong at first thought he made horrible bruce wayne but as read some of the director comments it is apparent that was on purpose bruce wayne was patterned after kurt cobain and seen through that lens pattinson did good job he was uncomfortable being bruce wayne and resented being bruce wayne he wanted to be the batman as much as possible pattinson is far more than just pretty face and have to give him props batman relationship with the gotham pd was still evolving many disliked him as vigilante lt james gordon very well played by jeffrey wright had to vouch for him several times and their dynamic was good and interesting zoe kravitz was very good catwoman far better than halle berry shudder at that memory or ann hathaway and her character motivations were even better than michelle pfeiffer kravitz pulled off feline grace very well and interjected into her walk fighting and everything else her character was extremely well written and was not there just for the eye candy or gimmick she had good reason to be in the story and fulfilled that reason without falling into the damsel in distress cliché or being googly eyed at the batman she had good chemistry with pattinson collin farrell was unrecognizable as penguin version without umbrella or chintzy quacking but was terrific he was the old school version of penguin john turturro has been in some many comedic roles lately forgot how good he can be as carmine falcone he was really good andy serkis not doing motion capture for change made good alfred and paul dano was terrific as the psycho riddler again no costumes and wild gimmicks just good storytelling another concern had was the dark movie where they have people wearing black fighting at night in unlit areas that is one reason generally like costumes because they are usually not black this movie only had costumes both black oddly enough but the lighting was good enough to be able to see the fight choreography well and enjoy it saw it in the theater and am worried that those who wait to see it at home will suffer from the lack of brightness on tv screens but hope that is not the case can easily see this movie being trilogy as it is rumored to be it will not be part of the dceu or have cameos of other superheroes but it is what it is very well scripted and performed movie that although it was hours long never had me lose attention or be bored was not on the edge of my seat mostly but stayed interested as the plot twisted and things were revealed in steady pace it was not the best movie have seen but it was one that did enjoy and that am glad saw in the theater well done1.0\twhat saw was incredible beauty and creativity in short the greatest masterpiece for batman in terms of investigation darkness and depth of story and robert pattinson1.0\twow definitely the best comic book movie for me beats the dark knight love the attention to detail to the crime scenes pattinson is brilliant kravitz is brilliant wright is brilliant what movie1.0\ttldr it good movie but not one ll be buying or watching again gotham looks great loved the dark rainy atmosphere throughout but it lacks edge plays it safe and ultimately suffers from yet another uninspired dull and predictable hollywood script the good the pacing was good certainly didn feel like hour movie it looks great as said above the car chase scene was awesome zoë kravitz was fantastic as was paul dano and the unrecognizable colin farrell as the penguin nirvana the bad the script mostly one dimensional uninteresting characters monotonous and no comic relief whatsoever don think any character smiled throughout the entire movie too long score was meh some odd casting choices love john turturro but he made no sense here and sorry jeffrey wright is good actor but man he bore verdict ultimately say this is the 4th best batman behind the dark knight the dark knight rises and the original batman from 89 toss up between the last two and no way it stays at an where it currently sits say it settles in the mid to high say1.0\tthe batman started off strong like hardboiled crime with batman at the center as the movie progressed it kept my attention and was engaged however sadly towards the last 40 minutes or so the movie became largely weak spoken exposition and some pointless scenes for someone who loves good plot and twist this film did leave me bit disappointed acting was pretty good although at times sided little bit blend side the set design was done well to fit the characters overall expected more1.0\toverall loved the movie robert pattinson is great batman liked the darkness of the movie but three hours was way too long to sit through this seems to be the trend that dc and marvel movies are becoming longer and longer and in the future not going to go see those that are this long1.0\tnot movie for kids never it dense and absolutely the darkest and heaviest comic movie ever everybody knows who and where batman came from this movie shows what he does in his whole splendor many people will consider this movie boring and slow but this is very real world batman was very happy after it ends felt like listening slayer full discography1.0\tas an avid comic book reader this hits so many points that have been missed in every other version of the character the narration from battinson sets the tone as if you were reading comic that was moving infront of you and batman finally seems like the detective he meant to be the riddler is down right unsettling and the colin farrell is both visually and vocally unrecognizable literally everyone killed their roles could ve watched hours of this lol matt reeves and everyone involved just get it easy 10 10 also the general realism makes you believe all of this could really be possible loved it so much1.0\tit was kind of new unseen batman until now nolan dark knight liiiiitle bit better but still 10 for me loved it brilliant batman you will see bruce wayne times for the whole movie it batman most of the time perfect catwoman and riddle1.0\tevery batman movie is compared to the nolan trilogy because that is the benchmark this batman movie however doesn try to compete it takes very different perspective focusing on the detective part of batman repertoire as he tries to solve the riddler crimes and how they link back to him and his family although we do still have few fancy gadgets and violence to go with it this is very dark noir film and perhaps portrays the tone visually and musically of gotham better than any film to date the number of references to subtle elements of comic history are frequent and satisfying to identify and pattinson grungy batman looks very much like he is modelled on batman from the new 52 understand some people will feel frustrated with the long 3hr run time that they ll feel there isn much original elements to the story granted some of the characters aren given the time they need for the viewers to really connect with them but then again not every character needs or deserves full development not least from batman perspective anyway however would counter that by saying that batman adaptions always have to have some level of overlap in this film the adaption of the riddler is truly unique foe that hasn had the screen time he deserves the cinematography is breathtaking in it execution as is the sparing use of colour with some scenes looking like they re lifted straight out of comic page andy serkis as alfred john turturro as carmine falcone jeffrey wright as detective gordon robert pattinson as batman and paul dano as the riddler are all absolutely excellent in their roles you won even recognise colin farrell as the penguin the star in my opinion is zoe kravitz as selina kyle she absolutely steals the show and manages to capture the toughness tenderness and moral complexity of catwoman perfectly lastly the use of nirvana song something in the way is absolutely perfect for the film capturing its essence to tee an incredible unique portrayal of gotham and the dark knight well worth it1.0\tmarvel owns the superhero genre it about time warner and dc tried something different they already did it with joker so why not follow the same route with the batman this is not an action movie or superhero special effects party it slow paced noir that balances itself between dialogue and violence the end result is very nice film that not made for comics fans but for movie enthusiasts basically the polar opposite to justice league or batman superman it dark slow paced and realistic considering the subject matter with fantastic camera work and very well done cgi the penguin chase is perfect example plus the main cast has excellent chemistry so almost every scene feels very natural the only negatives are in some plot details seen million times and the general length some dialogue may have been cut and the film would ve flown lot better in my opinion but it still one of the best batman movies ve seen and ve seen them all since 1989 tim burton original0.0\tentertaining but had to switch off half way thro just seemed to drag on and on same old scenes also question has to be asked why another batman answer is for the kids of today my advice is check out batman 1989 only one daylight scene in whole movie so sets same moody atmosphere but alot more fun1.0\twow batman tale finally gets the major movie treatment the story deserves finally of 10 miss great theme song and don forget to watch the credits1.0\tthe batman is dark detective film at its heart combination of the likes of zodiac se7en and batman the dark knight still reigns undisputedly as the best batman film but this attempt by reeves is solid there is almost zero bruce wayne in this film which don have problem with personally but batman fans are fond of seeing balance between the billionaire and the bat on screen chemistry between zoe kravitz and robbert pattinson is great but can help feel that this cat woman was lacking in some aspect that has already been conveyed perfectly on screens multiple times all the actors are solid but particularly loved jeffrey wright performance as the commissioner which felt real and down to earth the movie drags horrendously in the last hour and you can feel every minute pass the cinematography is an easy 10 10 but the overall movie is an pray they do not continue the story of the final scene ps batman tanking bullets not fan of that1.0\tthis movie is most true to the comics batman is the best when he is solving crimes and ve been waiting for one of these for while the dark knight trilogy is really good but rather watch 10 more of these some of the script sounded bit uncharacteristic of batman but then remembered that this is batman in his 20s trying to figure his life out cannot wait for the trilogy or hopefully double trilogy1.0\twill not write long review on the film but as true fan of comics video games animated and tv series and all films as die hard fan of the dark kinght can say with certainty that the batman is the best theatrical batman of all times this film is perfect in all of its genre1.0\tthe batman was perfect the fight scenes the batmobile gotham the whole movie was everything wanted and then some am just speechless best batman movie ever1.0\tit is long and it is dark but enjoyed the movie for the most part some very cool set piece scenes the acting was pretty good the way gotham was created for the film reminded me of the video game series emo bruce wayne was probably the least enjoyable or part of the movie but it wasn that bad worthy addition to the batman cinema history1.0\tthis awesome am so excited for movie think these movie beat the dark night robert is best actor we chose for batman thanks again and have you are yet bro plz find attachment for my updated resume please bro plz dubbed breaking is master piece and am going is best actor in the morning but he in few weeks have lot going0.0\tthis movie is ok other than that it doesn establish anything new and refreshing it like nolan trilogy but more aggressive even nolans trilogy has more fun and enjoyable time more than this movie this movie is so much overrated it just not what was expecting love darkness movie but my problem was just how the movie didn give me what was expecting1.0\treally enjoyed this movie the score was amazing and the actors did great job specially pattionson in the theater was like wow is this him is this robert pattionson and pattinson nailed it also zoe kravitz was perfect catwoman she is the best live action catwoman with no doubt cinematography was perfect and the flow of the movie was really smooth dramatic plot mainly focus on the detective skills of the batman also it remembers us that this batman is new to this vigilante job and that was perfectly done by matt reeves so finally am giving huge 10 10 stars for this great cbm1.0\tthink it good movie but think it good movie too but the office of the will wi we1.0\tno disrespect to my homeboy christopher nolan but this is the greatest batman movie that ever been made it been long time since ve gotten legitimate enjoyment out of superhero comic book movie and this thing sucked me in from the first scene all the way till the end credits not going to babble on about all the film achievements on the craft side because seeing it in imax the film really speaks for itself walked out of the theatre giddy with excitement which like said doesn happen at all anymore with these kinds of movies anyway if you re not already planning on going to see this movie please do matt reeves clearly put every ounce of blood sweat and tears he had into this movie and it really shows can understand people calling this rip off of films like se7en zodiac but those are amazing films to crib from so not bothered by it also very worth noting this film is pretty goddamn amazing too1.0\tnow waner brothers dc build justice league movie franchise fans of all ages are waiting for you all to get it together1.0\tafter zillion animated looking superheroes finally movie that is not made for teenagers but for adults too this is darkest batman that we ve ever seen the movie is very detailed deep mysterious matt reeves really understood assignment and he did not give us overused old tricks recipes but fresh mysterious dark movie with bruce wayne someone finally figured out psychotic hero very very good pattinson was perfect choice1.0\tright up there with dark knight as best batman film love how this one takes it back to the roots as detective story much of it has police procedural vibe it has dark scary vibe that really enjoyed the characters and acting are well done batman actually has character arc here and changes over the course of the movie which was incredible to see of course the special effects were very well done with some really exciting sequences this is very long movie but the only thing that will let you know it long is your bladder was completely hooked and loving it through its long runtime my only criticism is that there were few details that didn completely make sense like the opening monologue in which batman says the bat signal strikes fear into the hearts of criminals but then when he confronts criminals they act like they ve never heard of batman before there are also some scenes that require suspension of disbelief in an otherwise pretty realistic movie at the end of the day thoroughly enjoyed this one and hope to see more like it0.0\tso the massage of this movie is that politicians are bad but people who want to punish them are worse that person struggled his entire life in an orphanage and had terrible life while batman grew up in privileged life liven with white reach people and then the person who was right and was fighting against injustice ends up in jail and batman lives his great life what the hell1.0\tthe batman 2022 follows batman as he is forced to delve into gotham corruption in order to catch masked criminal known as the riddler this film really was everything wanted it to be even go as far as to call it masterpiece can see any other film coming out this year topping this film firstly the characters and acting were all perfect each character was written well and felt brutally realistic and human problem ve had with live action bruce wayne in the past is that couldn resonate with him and he felt too emotionless however pattinson does the role perfectly and is loveable but also troubled the highlight from this film for me is paul dano as the riddler dano is my favourite actor and he nailed the role he was terrifying and eerie but could relate to some parts of his character the design was brilliant too and really liked it the cinematography and visuals in this film were beautiful and was speechless at so many of the shots the colour palettes were gorgeous and real stand out making this brilliant cinema experience the overall look of gotham was unique too it felt dull and depressing something absolutely adored about this movie was the score it perfectly captured the tone and it was epic it also included some great and fitting songs in the soundtrack too ll never be able to listen to ave maria the same ever again lastly the pacing was really good this was something was little worried for due to the long runtime but this film managed to be entertaining the whole time and didn once get bored it doesn feel too crammed either which is an issue have with superhero films from marvel the tone was bleak and melancholic you can tell this film takes inspiration from se7en1.0\tfor me theres no comparing the batman with the dark knight similar to the joker this movie creates its own identity and is great addition to the caped crusaders story now wanted to rate this at about so decided to round up due to imdb whole number score policy the first half of this movie was absolutely incredible the gotham matt reeves portrayed was exactly what was hoping for its dark gritty brutal and on the verge of total chaos robert pattinson batman is trying to make difference in the crime infected city early on in his time as the hero vigilante and he gets little help from his good friend jim gordon jeffrey wright and his newer ally selina kyle zoë kravitz my favorite parts of this film without spoiling anything is the writing for these complicated puzzles that the riddler provides throughout it gives strong zodiac killer vibe and pulls the actual detective skills out of batman that we havent seen too much of before the penguin played by colin farrel is also an excellent character and provides great depth to the insanity of gotham crime underworld my biggest concerns with the film are the runtime and the final act the build up is incredible so slightly understand the lengthy hours it needed but there were definitely scenes that could have been cut or edited appropriately for time finally on the actual final act found it to be somewhat underwhelming for everything they took us through leading up to it it seemed as if the writing just got little lazy towards the end overall this movie is great addition the dc universe and hope we will get to keep this version of batman christian bale is still my favorite bruce wayne but pattinson has definitely moved into the top spot as batman for me all fans of the caped crusader will love this film1.0\tmy problem with dc titles is they are so horrible that when decent movie like this comes along people lose their minds and start calling it masterpiece it happened with wonder woman which was also decent but heavily flawed was impressed with the story and with the actors but the pacing was slow and the stakes were not high enough sorry you can claim to be edgy and dark and be pg 13 the marvel movies work because they have high stakes great conflict drama and comedy there wasn single laugh here and the tension was low because you just have an idea of where this is going all along this is better then the 1st gen movies from burton and schumacher put in in 3rd behind begins and rises sorry thought dark knight was turd yes heath gave great performance but aaron eckhart and maggie cabbage patch ruined the movie for me for me expectation were high and the film was decent hence my 10 but this is no classic masterpiece or even modern standard by all means you should see this but there are far better superhero films in the lexicon and until dc figures out how to capture lightening in bottle movies like this are as good as it going to get so all said ll close with this james gunn sucks when dc has to hire guys like him and joss to raise their stock it clear the brain trust over there are complete idiots1.0\tmatt reeves has not only created masterpiece of movie but he has also made the best batman movie ever robert pattinson absolutely smashes it as bruce wayne the batman he plays the character with such intensity and vulnerability he is my new favourite batman paul dano plays the riddler and he is frightening colin farrell is incredible andy serkis is incredible zoe kravitz is amazing as cat woman matt reeves genius the score is haunting and beautiful1.0\tthis is not superhero story this is suspenseful film noir crime mystery starring batman it dark it gritty it violent and it captivating rp is great batman possibly the best1.0\twant to give this higher rating not comparing it to the legendary dark knight film because that like comparing apples to oranges hollywood has yet again produced remarkable batman film my only beef had with it is the continued white privilege agenda speech that was made offended by it and not even white leave that out of movies that what protests are for anyways robert pattinson did an outstanding job truly impressed with the bat voice the film overall gave me batman animated series vibe giving the audience an idea of what batman is thinking throughout the investigation was fun dissatisfied with the promo of the film literally all of batmans best moments was shown in the trailer in all the film was still worth seeing and looking forward to the sequel1.0\tthe movie is awesome music is stunning the movie is more shot in dark background or it like dark theme very minimal characters are being used don miss it if you are fan of batman1.0\tduring broadcast can stop moving because of batman incredible performance this is very unexpected in fact after coming home from the cinema still ringing in my head1.0\twas fearing the worst about robert patterson as batman pleased to say he proved me massively wrong he not the best batman michael keaton but he is very good as an early version definitely good film with seeing as it does batman year one justice only bug bear is it did not have to be hours long my 18 year old son however has seen it times now0.0\tfelt like was getting punk while watching this hour excuse for film have no idea how this film is getting these reviews in order to have good batman film you need some good action good villain and decent story this had none of those elements have not been this disappointed in movie in long time perhaps the high expectations from christopher nolan and todd phillips masterpieces set my expectations too high1.0\tthe batman exceeds my expectations in every way it dark gritty noir detective thriller like se7en the movie is beautifully shot every frame could be picture you can put on your wall easily one of the most beautiful movies ever and definitely the most beautiful comic book movie ever made it an excellent written beautiful shotted excellent acted and directed movie with stunning action scenes and my new personal favorite movie of all time this movie is why big screens exist and please please go see it in the cinema because this movie is pure cinema every character gets beautiful development throughout the film and honestly don know why there are so many negative reviews on rotten tomatoes its not kid friendly this sort of reviews they are all laughable and really unfair imo because obv this movie is not gonna be kid friendly why are all trying to put the movie down stupid nevertheless this movie is just awesome and one of the best movies ever made last but not least paul dano riddler is honestly terrifying and easily my 2nd favorite live action comic book villain 1st is heaths joker and easily one of the best antagonists in cinema ever that opening scene where they introduce riddler and batman is so perfect and my favorite opening scene in any movie ever and did tell you about the score batmans catwomans and riddlers themes are so beautiful gosh can stop talking about this masterpiece1.0\twas little worried about pattinson but he managed very well in my opinion the best batman so far it was dark as it should be awesome soundtrack this movie has vibe of the 90 batman cartoon0.0\tyou know that they had five different endings for this movie they were arguing which one do we go with then someone said let put them all back to back to back just when you think it over nope then it over nope robert pat is not as bad as you thought as batman but there only so much that you can take zoe does fine enough job but overall distorted way too long our work rented out theater for 150 employees they all said the same thing not one of them loved this movie1.0\tthis movie explores face which has never been shown in the movies but is one of the most important traits in the comics batman beeing detective hes not known for anything as the worlds greatest detective and its explored in the best way possible the film reminded me lot of zodiac with the riddler beeing the murdered which they need to catch robert pattinson as batman is great and feels even more attached to reality than the nolan trilogy this batman is brutal he is vengance but he is still learning in what he needs to mean he still doesnt hold back against criminals he needs to refine his gadgets it shows that despite beeing some time as batman he needs to grow even more and the interpretation robert gives is excellent he will no longer be known as the vampire that shines but rather as probably the most brutal batman of all the story is also great the mistery at some point in the movie really confused me and needed reminder of where were we heading but it was just for moments the music was really good the fight scenes despite not being lot the ones that are are very impresive everything feels so realistic and grounded in earth that you believe it could actually happen in real life the one big problem have with the movie is how it was filmed dont know if it was mistake at my theather but the movie was too dark not that it was edgy or something but that at somepoints couldnt see what was going on points were really forced my sight to see what was happening and went to see this movie with my family and they had the same problems not knowing what was happening also think was really near speaker because there were moments were said damn its too loud but overall great movie great characters fantastic batman fantastic story despite being moments where couldnt see anything and really hope to see sequel with the quality of this one1.0\tmatt reeves creates memorable scenes throughout this fantastic movie and robert pattinson as grim as it was imagined his character pictures fantastic batman loved the movie because it was fresh it added another dimension to batman the chemistry with selina was good the villains were credible the scenery breathtaking hope sequel will be made where more of burce wayne will be revealed1.0\tthis movie is what ve always wanted from batman almost entirely in his suit this movie has some of the highest highs of any movie have ever seen the cast is amazing the sound design when you guys see the bat mobile for the first time it will shake you to your core highly recommend0.0\trobert pattinson is horrible bruce wayne instead of the broody bad ass he is more like fragile child who is amazing at solving riddles in seconds but is otherwise inept at normal conversation with horrible dialogue making the character look idiotic with an entourage of bad 70s gangster movies caricatures0.0\trobert pattinson puts on piss poor performance as batman he only seems to do one thing well brooding teen boy his acting is one dimensional not captivating in any way fight scenes were incredibly lame and frankly the special effects didn help him much the bike he rode was weird and honestly can you even call that cobbled together contraption batmobile the story line was really slow and seemed to honestly just be full of gaps in the cannon all in all it was big budget film with low budget production quality and subpar acting from start to finish by what seems like very poorly selected cast this was just sad remake of tim burton 1989 batman the writers should have taken clue from their predecessors over the last 30 years maybe they would have made good film then personally absolutely hated it and if never watch it again it ll still be too soon1.0\tthe batman movie review the batman is perfect batman movie on every single level and is masterpiece of movie everything about it is amazing and robert pattinson is my favourite batman of all time just from this one film the story the characters the city and the corrupted psychopath villain of the riddler is all handled perfectly one of the best comic book movies ve ever seen in my entire life must watch for any superhero fan the best batman movie hands down1.0\tit never too late for dignity after few shaming show ups during the last couple of years batman returns with vengeance respectful effort and even more so compared to the other superhero movies out there you can say that the film benefits in way as the competition marvel movies is not even trying won argue against that as reserved superhero film fan was somewhat excited about this one gotta give it to them they sold it well but even though think this is sincere try at creating something special it didn deliver to meet my aggressive expectations while think the film does well on so many levels something was bugging me constantly while watching it and that was the highly convenient writing it difficult to explain it perfectly without bringing examples from the film and spoiling it but what mean by that is things coming together nicely in the story thus conveniently but without feeling earned and genuine it so annoying it takes away so much from the film then again sporadical glitches with the writing are my only problem with the film liked the way reeves approached the story his vision is bold throughout the batman doesn feel like your typical superhero movie reeves avoids any comic book movie trope and fully leans on the mystery thriller elements executing them expertly you can feel the moody atmosphere of the film drew you in you get involved and have an intimate interaction with what you re watching but that not only due to reeves assured direction now oscar winner cinematographer fraser gets to display his skills behind the camera in his most challenging film yet and delivers in high fashion the batman looks gorgeous in its grimness greig manages to maintain shadow ish tonal lighting throughout complementing the theme and yet in the mids of all that dark he also finds room to parade these intense colors of orange red and blue beautiful color palettes have no problem with long movies as long as everything shown in the film comes together nicely it all about the pace if the film maintains the same rhythm throughout it doesn matter how long it is the batman might drag bit here and there especially during the third act but for the most part it runs smoothly and it competently justifies its almost three hour long running time now word about rob remember fuzz going on when they announced pattinson would be playing batman people didn like the choice be reading up and down the internet comments like the guy from twilight and such stupid people robert pattinson is the living proof of the evolution theory he went from being daddy princess favorite to now being the idol of the cult crowds the lighthouse high life and more now that what call true darwinism on serious note think pattinson truly embraced the role and to me he the best batman ever chapeau1.0\trobert patterson as batman felt was different but unique role for him and think he handled it really well not as good as christian bale say but still very believable it had really great characters and cinematography and was glad to see zoe kravitz have role in big movie since mad max fury road1.0\tsaw this movie three times within weeks and have been completely taken away by it the visuals were inspiring to me as an artist as was the setting the music is perfect for this batman and so happy that this movie was mostly batman and less bruce wayne sure we ll get the opportunity to see more of bruce wayne in the next film but really enjoyed the shift of bruce not having time for himself and devoting all his energy to the batman he still figuring it out it his second year that playboy personality is sure to come very excited for where they take the characters left behind and what route the story will go looking forward to the sequel 101.0\tok will say the truth when heard they are going to make yet another batman movie thought to myself dc has really gone crazy by now they throw continuity out the window and didn even care to do dc extended universe anymore and already know they will make 300 more batman movies like confused now there was batman before few movies then the dc justice league with difference batman then suicide squad with dont even know which batman then the joker movie which was incredible that who was the batman there now this one so was like wait so this one is just not related batman movie or another world or what it so hard to follow so many stories so many worlds what is that the 10th movie or so that they are making of batman so came to this throwing all that continuity out the window and just to enjoy yet another batman movie and let me tell you if you manage to forget the other stories movies and think of this one as stand alone movie it fantastic what like about this one is the fantastic acting the amazing dark vibe it feels lot more movie for adults it feels like dc batman movie how dc batman movie should have been made understand they want to make it for kids as that where money comes from so it pg 13 but mean really think if they made it an rated that could have been 12 10 movie they give you lot more of that detective batman as he is the worlds best detective originally at least that was the original tagline of batman acting fantastic effects fantastic vibe fantastic paste fantastic romance is the first time the romantic story here was believable always like to see how they making catwoman in this resetting batman stories like michelle pfeiffer with that drastically crazy sexy vibe of that catwoman which was admittedly not realistic at all but all that movie vibe was comics so it fit that vibe well and with anne hathaway with the more tactical catwoman rule and that 700usd hot toys figure they made for her and finally with halle berry in that movie catwoman which was seen by dont know very few people and all gave it an extremely low score which it didn deserve in my opinion so in here they finally made her correct think not too overly sexy not too overly tactical and not whatever it was that halle berry was playing all was great only concern really is the rated that could have been amazing and for dc please stop making more batman movies or if you do just tell more stories about him there is so many ideas in the comics how he is older and still needs to be the batman and can bearly walk or move and needs to do special suites to make him move as fast or alternative batman movies there is literally infinity ideas in the comics for more batman related stories just stop making the same batman origin movie over and over again as for this movie it really good one probably the best batman origin movie there is0.0\tpattinson did alright as batman kravitz had to make the predictable dig at the rich white guy ya know the same ones that pay her salary because she felt her being black cat woman needed some recognition sorry halle berry been there done that no backstory weak plot why did pattinson always look like homeless man in dire need of shower the few times he wasn wearing the frumpy bat suit christian bale you re still king1.0\tthis as good as hoped it would be firstly robert pattinson plays great batman moody scary reckless and resourceful also it real joy to see detective batman following case and the fact that pattinson really seems to embrace playing batman and unlike the marvel films is more than content to level his mask on even in the most critical scenes is great to watch and helps the film would have been good to see bit more character and emotion from bruce wayne though bit too and know it cliche emo batman felt pattinson dialed it in bit but ll forgive it for how well he played batman he might even have been the best batman ve seen the setting of gotham is also fantastic vibrant busy and dangerous city is truly put across and it feels alive other positives are gordon and kravitz as cat woman and hey she didn beat up batman like half these movies these days where an obviously weaker and less skilled female character beats up male character to show how badass she is but guess to score the woke points in other areas they had to have all the bad guys being white straight men sigh silly comment about rich white men and ofcourse the only good politician was young black lady really trying to push kamala here there also seemed to be hinted at lesbian relationship which will be cut out for overseas censors or am just paranoid don have problem with these points if they naturally flow out of the story but they did feel artificial and placed by the boardroom the movie was also too long most of the scenes fit but it wasn continual builder like the dark knight so it did feel bit long although always enjoyable the riddler villain was good match for batman but would ve liked more face to face conflict seems like bit more negative than it should be the movie was very good it followed its own path and stands out on its own as another side of one of the greatest hero characters looking forward to the next batman film with hopefully new gallery of villains and lot more mask on moments0.0\tthe moody vampire feel did not help and the bitter gut wrenching white male angst about privilege was at best misguided why anyone would want to watch this is beyond me1.0\tthe batman is film that does every thing right when it comes to editing and cinematography it completely blew my mind will compare the whole movie to zack snyders justice league where in the end the flash runs back in time robert plays the characters very well though wouldn mind seeing more of bruce wayne in the next film the movie focuses on the batman side of the protagonist meaning the screen time for bruce wayne wasn there for robert he played batman very well and liked how he was portrayed as utterly violent but merciful the only critic thing have to give this film is how the ending of sequences was handled it became somewhat difficult to feel part of the movie in those ending of sequences still this meant that the sequences themselves was highlighted as the masterpieces they are the scene where the bat car is being revealed puts you right at the edge of your seat but at the end of the revealing of the car it only launches forward bit to trig oz to flee but why not make oz flee on his own and then complete the revealing of the bat car launching after oz in complete diesel rage it just seems as if the writing didn match the cinematography plan for the scene but that could just be me with hot take highly recommend people to watch it themselves and also please experience it in cinema because the cinematography and editing is astonishing1.0\trobert pattinson did really well really feel the connection between him and former dark knight although it about solving puzzle but the action still pretty dope just love this no more word to say1.0\tfantastic movie maybe bit to long might have shaved 30 mins off but it still excellent stuff riddler is an absolute nutter so good farrell as penguin is brilliant you would never have guessed it was him kravitz combines cool fragile strong as cat woman pattison plays bruce wayne batman brilliantly it must watch action is great plot it very good really worth seeing1.0\tthis movie was far better than expected love that it like detective story where the audience can guess with the batman it was getting more and more interesting the story very good the characters were great liked that jim gordon was very much involved the riddler was fantastic and robert pattison nailed his role as batman bruce wayne here is depressing yes like bales wayne more but from what he used to be was great and did great job and he fits so much in this role as bruce wayne catwoman wasn used as much as expected but this is exactly how want it to be the third act was for few seconds questionable and think bit too long but it not bad thing and like it the scores from michaels giacchino are amazing as always and liked the action sequences as well very good comic book adaption and even people who don like batman but love crime thriller stories can watch it1.0\tslick and stylish but maybe just little too long the acting was well done dc appears too have left the overly cartoonish movies in the past the batman was gritty sometimes violent movie and almost entirely dark movie well done1.0\tside of bruce wayne we never saw great movie and incredible acting robert pattinson was awesome its the beggining of era for his carrer the riddler his acting is great and the plans and motivation were dark the other villains did great job in the movie1.0\tthey pulled it off was really afraid me and my boyfriend went to see this on his birthday afraid it would ruin his day but it was hours of marvelous experience was really glad they did it this long that how you make super heroe movie thank you edward cullen vibes only in the 10 first minutes think they dit it just to tease us1.0\tthe batman is very special film think he ll be disappointment to lot of people who want batman that jumps and brawls through cgi imagery throughout the movie but for anyone who wants to watch character drama and thriller that has an incredible soundtrack and where every single frame is work of art and looks perfect batman is for you in addition robert pattinson plays an incredible bruce wayne batman for me contrary to the opinion of others who is something different but also develops much more depth than all his predecessors for me it is great film and definitely recommend it really check it out in cinemas worth it for the soundtrack alone1.0\twas glued to the screen the entire time despite the 3hr long run time robert pattinson and the entire cast has done absolute justice to their roles the movie is dark shows us batman like we ought to be shown taking nothing away from the batman trilogy we so love but this is absolutely sensational kudos to the makers and to the man of the hour robert pattinson to prove us all wrong1.0\tthe same darkness and grit as the joker this batman is angry each punch feels like he going to cave someone head in no mercy full force he is vengeance1.0\tbeste perfomance for pattinson who played bruce wayne batman never underestimated him for playing this film the fight scene is epic but slightly better than tdk chemistry between alfred and bruce not peeled much it makes me sad because alfred its like father to bruce but beside that the batman was such as best dc films in 20221.0\tsadistic serial killer is on the loose detective duo is on the case trying to discipher the many riddles and clues he has left behind if that plot synopsis sounds familiar it because it the exact plot of se7en mixed with bit of zodiac matt reeves must be big fincher fan but here is the kicker so se7en is my all time favorite movie and batman is my all time favorite character well him and michael myers and to see this amalgamation of character and world left me shaken this is fantastic film incredible directed brilliant acted accompanied by beautifully score the film is rain drenched neon illuminated nightmare don bring the kids1.0\tthe batman by matt reeves is delight to the movie lovers he leaves no stone unturned to keep us hooked robert pattinson tries his best to fit the character of batman and is almost successful almost because christian bale has played the character flawlessly nevertheless the movie never leaves us boring1.0\twhat can say about the movie but holy this movie was epic pure and simple matt reeves is freaking genius every single characters had their moments to shine not just robert pattinson and know what people are saying bruce wayne and batman was too different for them but have to understand that every batman is going to be different in each universe and also to further note this year two of batman career of crime fighting he is going to make mistakes he is not the well season crimefighter just yet trust me during his year through year one three in the comics he was making mistakes and like that they touch on that in the movie and like how they explore the detective side of things for batman what can say about the story was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next thing to happen and the riddler was the perfect as villain very different then he was portrayed and loved it and love the way catwoman was portrayed too as the antihero even jim gordon was portrayed right as honest cop each of them had their had moments in the spotlight as stated even when their was fight scene you knew that each punch and kick would hurt and just love the way batman was just fearless in the movie he was taken no from anyone and that why would give this movie very solid 101.0\tmasterpiece very like the movie it is the best batman movie ever villian was so good and the atmosphere of gotham was amazing it is like comic book story and the other characters catwoman penguen gordon was really nice advise everybody to who loves batman1.0\tthis is what batman should be the story of broken man doing his best proper detective story pattinson is out is this world as both bruce wayne ans batman he absolutely crushes this role everyone casted for this film were perfect1.0\tthis is the first batman with an actual plot in which the caped crusader is looking to solve crime it doesn just have mindless action like most of the other batman movies do but instead makes out batman and his ally gordon to be detectives attempting to unravel each of the riddlers maniacal murders pattinson and kravitz make for an interesting duo complementing each other superbly through the film not to mention pattinson portrayal of the role is far superior to any other including that of christian bale1.0\tmatt reeves presented impactful batman outing this one is dark gorgeous visual cinematic experience scripting is excellent emotions and actions blended perfectly robert pattinson is outstanding every characters are well defined powerful dialogues are another backbone the making is bonus the visuals music and some shots are pure goosebumps the dark knight returns with glory1.0\tthis is well shot well edited and feels like it taken from batman more detective noir roots that we see from the comics plus the way they shoot the city brings another character to life with how corrupt gotham is this is everything every comic book fan wants from batman and more1.0\t11 10 this movie stands out from all the other batman movies having more realistic take on the cape crusader the cinematography was outstanding absolutely beautiful this movie had me speechless1.0\twe had bad angle to watch this so need to see it again but the constant flashing lights and lights pointing right into the camera is what wanted to mention here had my eyes shades or covered for about 25 minutes1.0\thate robert pattinson with his alleged body odor and his effete sparkling and don really like batman what super about this superhero but well wow loved this movie yes pattinson is the most emo batman you re likely to ever see but it works it dark it complex it rather realistic actually the soundtrack actually reinforces and moves the story along really interesting and new take on the caped crusader well worth the long run time of over hours1.0\tthis film purely depicts the real batman story strong storyline no exaggerated action sequences strong characters build up and most importantly robert pattinson looks absolutely stunning in that bat suite1.0\tit the best batman movie after dark night it not normal batman more like detective movie the whole movie is dark realistic and robert pattinson killed that role it perfect fresh fully entertaining movie1.0\twent in with lukewarm expectations loved the first teaser that was released back in august 2020 and was super hyped but that slowly started dying down for me as the release date came closer was still excited to see the movie as love matt reeves previous works still consider the new planet of the apes trilogy to be one of the best trios ever made and boy did reeves not disappoint with his version of the batman from the start it made clear that this is going to be dark eerie and gloomy movie the tone is set and it never changes which think worked well for the movie it an amazing detective thriller story where we join batman and gordon in solving the crimes happening in gotham this intertwined with other socio political things happening with falcone and oz show how rotten gotham is selina gets involved in this too loved zoe version of catwoman she did an amazing job here and although you see very little of paul dano outside of his riddler costume but when he does its chilling and memorable the action sequences are great the fights are so grounded and real and show how strong batman is the chase sequence that was teased in the trailers was one of the best sequences in the movie the sound music and visuals it was very exhilarating greig fraser work in this movie is so damn good am dumbfounded how he managed to pull two visually great movies within year dune and now this he is one of the best cinematographers working in the industry and he is at the top of his game the sets locations and visual effects look very raw and believable and almost convinces you that you re there in gotham with all these characters it is almost hour long movie and would say at some points you do feel the length but think the overall story justifies its duration am super excited for the spin off tv series that matt reeves has lined up and the obvious sequel to this movie1.0\tthis movie is truly amazing it is detective story that is better then most of any thing else dc made am really hope for trilogy and robert pattinson is the batman1.0\treally good one of the best batman movies watched it twice 10 tdk is still no for me pattinson has become my favorite batman completely nailed the characterization matt reeves really did great job he made batman great again just like christopher nolan the direction cast acting camera work music cinematography action etc everything was great few negatives are pacing runtime the villain tease in the end felt misplaced the batman universe he created has lot of potential and bright future hope he makes sequel soon1.0\tthis is cinema for too long we ve been too invested in the same trite formula of what superhero movie should be dc has been guilty of it as well with bvs justice league etc but with the batman we travel back to the heart of detective comics with full blown crime mystery thriller sure it had its fair share of large scale action sequences and sure it was little longer than would ve liked but the film itself is work of art brilliant cinematography music story acting for the most part we ve seen better bruce waynes but pattinson plays batman true to the comics the standouts for me are zoe kravitz as selina kyle and colin farrell as the penguin completely unrecognizable dano is terrifying as the riddler and jeffrey wright is great as always excited for the next installment 10 101.0\tthe batman is great film it as close to live action graphic novel as you will get the acting plot and dynamic are enthralling robert pattinson makes for great batman he seems to truly understand the role and looking forward to seeing him do this again so many things to like about this film the whole concept and execution smack of realism and as much as ve enjoyed the marvel offerings much prefer the grit and grime of this particular world the batmobile is friggen awesome1.0\tfirst of all it is not as good as the dark knight trilogy but it is very good batman movie the acting and cinematography are also great robert was really good batman1.0\tan absloute must watch what masterpiece review must contain 150 letters so am gonna type some gibrish in here bxbhxhhuoususuusuusususus7sjdjjjjdjdjjxkzz no but seriously go watch it such an amazing film1.0\tve read through these reviews and vast majority of them are the ones that are below are the ones must address this movie is dark and glum as some might say because this is set as batman first year detective side of the batman side of batman really digging into the depth of the effect his death of the parents if you read the comics batman has never been an outgoing hero what stands out about him is that he has no super powers he just man and that what this movie is about0.0\tthe movie has lot of flaws its one of the most overrated movie in the history of cinema the batman is trying hard to be the dark knight movies the movie was so dark can see damn think during the fight scenes robert pattinson was ok as batman the movie does not deserve so much praise0.0\twas complete waste of time well here some more characters waste of money waste of brain support waste at concessions waste of parking fee will not get back the lost time if covid scare had public relations advertisement0.0\tabout two hours too long and robert pattinson in the lead is still playing moody taciturn vampire albeit with pointy eared mask decent supporting cast but mediocre writing and directing drags them all down one positive is the humanization of batman not the utter lack of chemistry with catwoman but his physical limitations still all the gadgets but he actually has to run at times1.0\tput stars only because can say that is nice to watch as peace of art meaning cinematography aestetics and special effects they also really tried to make interesting plot but they were kind of unable to make it exciting everything was so flat and audience waited for something special happened but it all started from looks like kind of the dark detective movie to end up as mediocree teen tv one we were waiting for the punchline and each time when we got there we only got more confussion in general important things were short or were said in the lines of dialogues but what we saw stayed flat and boring am sorry that some people compare this teen movie with masterpiece and oscar winning movie jocker only one thing can connect these two and that is the dark visuals and nothing else we are even not sure if we saw something but wouldn say what to prevent spoilers producers even didn try to make any new music besides original theme didn like stealing the song from nirvana and you all know that score made only for that movie for jocker got the oscar as well1.0\tgot lucky to go to fans first premier thebatman perfect masterpiece battinson is absolutely phenomenal just straight up every action scenes gave me goosebumps this is well made brilliant masterpiece by matt reeves and michael giacchino music oh damn totally worth waiting for definitely gonna see 100 more times direction 10 10 cinematography 10 10 acting 10 10 screenplay 10 10 story 10 10 music 10 101.0\tfamiliar characters storylines are given gritty neo noir makeover with new perspectives on old themes the design lighting music along with many layered performances culminate in moody riveting worthy iteration nitrosmoviechallenge1.0\tall the buzzwords apply moody dark gritty immersive the film is all those things the batman exists within beautifully grungy world more real than its predecessors and yet at times the visceral darkness moves beyond the limitations of real becoming something more something fantastical and brooding fear has most definitely become tool robert pattison arrives to hell with the naysayers thought it was unique portrayal that easily stands proud next to that of christian bales he plays younger angstier bruce wayne filled with anger when we first meet him seemingly blinkered by his desire for enacting vengeance less worldly than his counterpart in the dark knight but no less convincing or inspiring when standing for justice in the face of adversity with that said all the performances were very good but notably and possibly my favourite must be colin farrell as the penguin hope we see lot more of him in the sequel overall enjoyed the plot and the unravelling of the riddler but for me it was all the other stuff that successfully drew me in the cinematography the editing the dialogue the fight choreography the soundtrack the verisimilitude of the world building absolutely loved the super noir detective thriller aspect of it all and the characters involved and their dynamics often more so than the actual core story and motivations of the antagonists but feel in this instance it almost didn matter the third act became muddled in places but thought they stuck the landing and delivered powerful closing sequence with batman choosing to become symbol for hope instead of just fear alone demonstrating growth and new awareness for the consequences of his actions it an epic piece of comic inspired art and recommend it purely for the lighting and camera work alone especially during the incredibly noteworthy car chase sequence which has got to go down as one of the greatest ever but there plenty more to love here good job matt reeves1.0\tfirst up always thought the villains of the batman films with the exception of batman begins were more interesting than the big bat himself here we finally meet an interesting haunting and searching batman bruce wayne gone is the bored billionaire playboy this bruce is all depressive and lost pattinson does an outstanding job and not just as the reclusive bruce his batman is equally impressive and thank god we see lot of him in action this is batman as film noir detective it is more reminiscent of sin city and watchmen than any of the previous batman films the villains impress as well kravitz is more believable as cat burglar and fierce cooky than hathaway from tdkr farrell as penguin doesn have lot of screentime but boy every time we see him he really steals the show and then there is paul dano as the riddler zodiac type psychopath that is utterly frightening great classic soundtrack full of leitmotif it is bit too long just under hours and around two third of the film it drags bit but definitely fresh and good new bat flick1.0\tand yes paid for my own tickets drove two hours for the privilege of watching it march 1st and do genuinely consider this the best batman movie ever made matt reeves was able to give us wholly different look at the character of batman while staying true to the original dc feel of the caped crusader it dark and gritty detective crime story that sets the stage perfectly in my opinion for the evolution of bruce wayne into more mature dark knight no one can go through watching the murder of their parents without incurring deep permanent emotional scars and loved how reeves and pattinson were able to convey the very natural human emotions in very real fashion without showing the same tired scene that been way overdone and without making bruce wayne any less of badass the brilliant delivery of the combination of pain anger pathos et al encapsulated everything that makes batman batman btw seriously liked the fact that everything was done with real measure no over the top theatrics etc all that went into the film belonged also rate robert pattinson performance as the best batman performance given to date yes fan but became fan because of his extraordinary talent as an actor consider his roles in such movies as the rover or good time for example to claim bad casting simply because he got his big break in teen vampire movie where he also gave superior performance especially given the nature of the material is just vitriol stemming from jaded elitest mentality if you want negative opinion about his performance in this movie to be taken seriously lose the twilight comparison since there is no comparison to be made between movies zoe kravitz also turned in an excellent believable performance thought casting her in the role of selina kyle was great decision in fact had no problem with any of the casting decisions paul dano peter sarsgaard colin farrell john tuturro and all the rest were terrific it all simply worked my recommendation is just this if you re dc fan watch the batman and form your own opinion not everyone will feel it rates or 10 stars but can see how anyone could honestly and fairly say there were no redeeming qualities1.0\tafter nolan batman trilogy felt batman had got bit off the track snyder cut justice league did fantastic job and now reeves and pattinson have finally pulled it off with this one good plot amazing hand to hand combat beautiful soundtrack and finally nice suit so yeah batman is back1.0\talways thought that the riddler was goofy villain that didn make me fear for gotham or batman at all but this movie changed that the riddler is actually creepy in this and his mere presence is intense the overall movie was also very intense and was very interesting the whole time1.0\tpattinsson really gives depth and darkness to batman this film moves in different direction to the dark knight trilogy and away from the cartoon traditional zap kapow good guy bad guy the batman instead is closer to the horror and thriller genre great performances from the troubled brooding pattinson playing against the equally dark farrell well worth watch think it holds it own against the dark knight trilogy but suspect it will be personal preference as to which you prefer have to say didn like the butler previously played by michael caine in the dark knight the character just didn seem to mesh although to be fair didn get much exposure solid 101.0\thas dc finally discovered the formula for making good superhero film you need an actual story that serves as the main focus and the abilities of the hero compliment it not the other way around batman is first and foremost detective and this film accentuated this aspect of the character more than his physical prowess expected to be disappointed in pattinson as the batman but was pleasantly surprised it was not an oscar worthy performance but he just seemed to fit this particular moody incarnation of the dark knight though the runtime is lengthy there was not single wasted scene and left fully satisfied1.0\twow it probably the longest ve spent in the cinema but it was so worth it patterson is very good batman it was dark and grungey film which was brilliant sound track was also brilliant well played1.0\tthe only thing was missing in this movie is the rated would have been the best live action batman robert did great job as the caped crusader but the main credit goes to matt reeves think this is the best version of gotham city have ever seen can wait to see the second and third one only then will be compared to nolan trilogy the dark knight1.0\tknow this is the first one in the trilogy and as the first movie it is not too bad liked robert pattinson as batman definitely liked catwoman and riddler other than that it is nothing that special fighting scenes are horrible even for second year batman the story was ok but it tried to tell too many stories the story about wayne family about falcony about gotham in general and its history and mix all that with mysteries and riddles from the riddler that is just too much to follow especially for people who are not already familiar with gotham and batman like my wife liked the gotham and the vibe of the movie it is just some little things that make me bit angry for example in the beginning it shows that criminals run away when bat symbol is shown in the sky awesome and then 30 minutes later no one has problem calling him freak to his face and starting fights with him what so batman in this one is nothing mythical even little bit nothing special he is more like kickass dressed as superhero and that is about it1.0\tit was good was skeptic at first as to create new batman story post the incredible nolan trilogy is quite big boot to fill it was different bruce wayne comes across little more emo and same character as batman but it worked it would be good to see batman multiverse someday1.0\ttdk trilogy has set the highest standard for batman universe for the past decade the batman set new one the batman exposes batman from different point of view less action less technology but show more brain and heart in other word batman is merely human who feels anger sorrow1.0\tnot overly taken by pattinson as an actor went into this movie not expecting that much quite long movie but held my interest throughour one point found little underwhelming were the masks work by pattinson and kravitz the rest of their costumes were excellent but these mask designs for this movie were fairly poor in comparison to what we have seen in other batman movies other than this point was quite entertained1.0\theard before watched the movie that it was going to be good movie and happy that it turned out that way very impressive absolutely masterpiece the best film have seen in 2022 so far everything is great from the excellent choice of actors to the outstanding dark lighting there is not dull moment in the film each scene is simply fascinating the plot is also quite detailed and there is no feeling of lack of detail or skipping in the film robert pattinson shows that he is suitable for the batman job and alongside zoë kravitz as catwoman they turned out to be one of the best couples in batman franchise history the only downside can say about this movie is the length hours for me it was fine and imperceptible but for some people it might be challenge so be prepared can wait for the next movie0.0\tthis was the most boring drawn out film have ever seen also why would they pick the vampire from twilight to play batman seriously would never have gone to see this if knew it was three hours either they included scenes that were pointless there was no need for it to be so long the plot was also dull it was more of boring mystery film1.0\tnever usually write reviews but this time it definitely credit to matt reeves robert pattison and the rest of the cast well done and we definitely need more and more if this saga0.0\tthe movie is hrs long and super mega boring don recall more boring movie in recent memory it just sequence of set scenes glued together by tedious car chases or bike chases zoe kravitz acting is way sub par but she does excel when she doesn talk contrary to my intial belief pattinson is actually quite good when he the batman when he out of character he just an emo like back to the 90s emo culture weird riddler is completely re mastered he was never like this in the comics or other batman shows bored out of my brain with this dribble1.0\twatch movies like the batman to see what super hero can do batman super power is his detective skills unfortunately this batman didn have much skill to speak of the movie like most batman movies is dark but this felt especially dreary1.0\tthis movie is not made for everyone if you like joker film you will love this movie this movie is bit slow that might make some people dont like it but for me love it because every dialogue is connected this movie is really different from another batman movie robert pattinson batman also different from the previous live action batman this batman is really smart and really show the world why batman is called the world greatest detective its better to read the batman prequel novel so that you can understand more about this movie0.0\tone of the films that skipped almost the first 40 minutes of the film due to boredom and waste of time but the rest was good but not to give it more than star it waste of stars1.0\tliked it there were few minor things that could be improved in some of the characters but that did not diminish my enjoyment of the movie overall will definitely be watching it again1.0\tfirst time watching the batman series and have not read the comics on the whole it ok the overall pace is slower and can make one little sleepy but if it from the role of the actor or something it still seems to be ok1.0\tthis movie was the best batman movie people enjoyed batman origin and his action from past movies but this movie has gave us different prospective of the character batman detective skill is great but we didn see that untill now also story telling in this movie is great and every actor did their best for the role matt reeves really made the best batman movie everyone must watch this movie0.0\tthe worst film ever seen went in with open mind but was greeted with colombo in mask the saving grace was cat woman in tight hot pants terrble terrible stop remaking films1.0\tjust saw the batman and it was fine movie nothing too special thought the movie was too long it went on about 45 minutes too long when they could have just ended there while understand why they did it and happened to get why they did it but it is still too long the new batman theme is underwhelming robert pattinson has decent batman voice and costume that does the job while his bruce wayne was lacking and was too edgy looking his bruce wayne pals in comparison to bales wayne it was too dark not enough levity and the riddler costume looked bad get the reason why but it still it is not accurate to the comics don believe batman needs to be super dark it could have few jokes in it and there was way to much rain like is gotham seattle it is fine movie but there is lots that can be improved in the sequel1.0\tfirst of all it good movie plot is well written and the movie has an artistic side too it as it goes with dark feeling and special light effects felt it was going too slow at times wanted some more action and faster pace catwoman was not good in my opinion patinson did surprisingly good as batman and the other characters in gothem were really good1.0\teverything about the film is great including the filming of greig fraser the soundtrack to michael giacino and of course the direction of matt reeves1.0\tbatman is problematic character in modern world he could do far more to fix gotham with his money as bruce wayne than his fists as batman this film faces that full on it also mentions that crime has gotten worse since he started his crusade of street vengeance and he has given the wrong people the wrong type of inspiration was truly impressed they went that far there are some issues when watching it you will definitely be able to see the films this one pulls from there are sequences that feel like deleted scenes from seven saw and penguin sometimes seems like de niro capone wandered in off the set of the untouchables the riddler is very good villain at 1st though he should come with the disclaimer riddler by chris nolan because he very much channels nolan brand of gritty realism the way joker did in the dark knight later you can see reeves pulling back trying to make him more comic bookish for sequels thought emo bruce would bug me but it might be the best disguise yet no one would suspect this bruce wayne of being batman ever he says some of the same things to the same people and they are credibly oblivious it worth seeing1.0\tliked this take on the batman character it really humanized him and gave bruce some interesting traits pattinson executed the dark depressing tone extremely well and was fully invested in his arc in fact found myself wanting more bruce wayne screen time all other characters played the part well though do feel there were too many of them thus creating too many tangents in the plot and creating bit of muddled mess personally think the entire sub plot should ve been dropped entirely and the screentime should ve been given to paul dano there could ve been some wicked chemistry between the riddler and batman which would ve made more compelling rivalry the prison scene between the two was prime example of this all in all enjoyable film just felt room for improvement1.0\twhat fantastic bit of cinema rp completely owns the roles as batman in his own unique spin if you love the watchmen then you ll love this the casting the mood and the acting was all perfect really refreshing take on comic book hero dc decided to go down the dark gritty route on this one and for me it has massively paid off0.0\tthis was truly horrible so predictable there was nothing that was creative or captivating about this movie the batman was an emo guy with no personality just hated every minute of it what is wrong with hollywood movies just lack of talent on both producers and acting side not worths watch wish could get those three hours back1.0\tthe perfect mix of classic mystery and action this is what superhero films have been needing for while frankly breath of fresh air had low hopes for this one to be honest the trailers made it seem almost like new cw show but don be mislead this is classic batman1.0\tdrawing heavily from the long halloween this version of batman finds gotham at its most grimey and horrible it incredibly well scored and cast colin farrell is stand out and some of the hand to hand fighting is exceptional few ropey scenes stop this being perfect and few revalations could ve used more time to breathe with that said this film is too long mostly because of long brooding shots of batman1.0\tall have to say is wow what movie this doesn even feel like superhero film this is straight up crime thriller film with batman in it love how gothic and neon gotham look with its dirty edgy atmosphere the cinematography the acting the glorious music score was fantastic this is up there with the dark knight and now my second favorite batman film1.0\tthe batman is one of the few movies that enjoyed watching recently it is like an arkham game coming into love action the plot is perfect cinematography is great the theme of the movie is consistent and the most important thing it introduces this version of the batman successfully robert pattinson version has perfectly managed to find its place in all the different versions of the batman really looking forward for its sequel to come1.0\tfantastic movie from beginning to end pattinson was amazing as were the rest of the cast definitely worth the wait well done dc plenty of nods to previous batman from tv film and comics over the years as well as merging stories that gave completely new cinematic version loved it1.0\tthat probably the best part it not super hero movie dc knew how to stand out from the generics it zodiac seven bit of the dark knight the actions aren that cool but stills holds its vibe robat robert pattinson is not just detective hero he becomes symbol but not of hope but of fearsome reality just somehow wish andy alfred could have had more grounds as alfred but yeh micheal alfred already took best alfred of the decade1.0\twatched this twice now have to really say this crime drama and detective noir take for batman was really risky and ambitious move from matt reeves and dc but the result is superb it like nolan said that unlike other characters batman benefits from different interpretations glad to see that dc has allowed creative freedom for directors to allow them to produce such beautiful movies1.0\tthis film is masterpiece it has been ages since christopher nolan has done the trilogy of the dark knight it is the moment that we have all been waiting for believe that this film will be taken to more different fresh and new approach and that is what the audience expects from this film more1.0\tdark gritty batman esque comic accurate loved every aspect of the movie the way they potrayed every character was just amazing the storyline and mystical touch to it was mesmerising the chemistry between the bat and the cat reminded me of the batman telltale game played few years ago the visuals and cinematography just makes it so much better the action was limited but loved every bit of it and yes robert nailed the role battinson is real must watch film1.0\tthis is by far the greatest comic book movie ever made let alone the best batman film we have ever gotten matt reeves and the team he managed to assemble have excelled with virtually every single facet of this film and the inordinate amount of passion they all brought on board it comic brought to life in the best way possible it beautifully moving dark emotional journey through the alleys and slums of gotham city that shows an immense understanding of not only this character and those around him but the world he inhabits as whole matt reeves robert pattinson michael giacchino and greig fraser understand batman in way that no one in the history of this franchise has before and that truly truly does show1.0\tthe gritty and gothic theme is so weel suited and the music and the characters really bring life to this movie while nolan work was phenomenal gotham just felt like chicago new york this feels like gotham from the comics brought to life really enjoyed battinson must watch1.0\tit very good intense dark and well crafted the story is beautiful tackles beautiful topics and flows beautifully cast ensemble is amazing as well on technical note it amazing too visual effects sound score and production design are all nice its only issue is that it unnecessarily so long0.0\thaven seen movie this bad in years it was as if the thing was trying to project itself as some sort of art emo art if anything and emo has been out of style more than an entire generation the music was wonderful at least1.0\tthis movie was very good movie liked it but yes there were things that were boring like the long plot or the villain all the talking fights were good in my opinion good movie1.0\tthe batman leads to the new era of wodc hope matt reeves takes the batman to the wholeverse this movie is suprise us so much new character designs cast colour themes story cinematography etc all are perfect for us we are highly waiting the battison wholeverse1.0\tthe batman is better than the dark knight this is what batman cinematic movie should of always been it was dark yet action packed with one of the best batmobiles of all time zoe was pretty good as catwomen she my second favorite after michelle pfeiffer1.0\tthe plot is excellent it one of the best versions of batman that makes it classic it not like the typical previous versions just loved it the batman shows us an excellent plot of the character that has never been seen before from his detective side and this already makes him film with dark touch within the crime story and on the other hand dramatic in the realization of the characters in addition it is perfect combination of shakesperanias ideas with the influences of comics all this makes it unique and completely different within the other versions1.0\tmust admit thought casting pattinson as the batman was laugh but he did such an amazing job he was great and hope this role will help him get away from the edward cullen character that everyone still sees him as the batman finally did pattinson the justice he deserved1.0\thopefully the joker will be present in the next episode and it will be great that was perfect in the following episodes the cat woman should have more romantic relationship with batman1.0\twhat this film does achieve is telling solid new batman story one with some pretty compelling twists and strong point of view on who exactly the caped crusader is by default that makes it one of the better batman movies ever made0.0\thad high hopes for this movie great cast and it had great audience review then watched it it very very slow ended up turning it off halfway through because it wasn getting any better just don know what to say about this other than was very disappointed maybe went in with too high of expectations not huge batman fan but this is probably the worst batman movie ve seen1.0\tone of the best movies ve seen the characters the plot the cgi everything and everyone was perfect robert pattinson was one of the best batman movie that you must see1.0\tit decent batman flick but far too long it feels like the editors just didn know how to cut some scenes dragged on and many just weren necessary it hours and would have been far better movie if it had been cut to it wasn bad but also not really anything memorable either felt that pattinson did good job as batman but not so much as bruce wayne his bruce wayne felt like the cringy spiderman emo tobey mcguire zoe kravitz was just ok as catwoman don get the hype behind her she can hold candle to michelle pfeiffer catwoman and frankly thought anne hathaway even did better than kravitz1.0\tve waited long for batman to return to his prime state and this is finally it incredible scenography and plot really loved how they made the character riddle1.0\tthis movie makes me feel that cinema is not dead characters are live villains are exact face of corruption in the gotham riddler is masterpiece specially because of violence that has been added to his actions robert patinsons dark and dead eyes catwoman is well done just sat down and enjoy the movie1.0\tto be honest can think of anything didn like in this film it probably the best batman movie you may not love it there are some things that aren really for everyone but personally thought it was amazing and it one of my favourite comic book movies one can call it bleak violent or too confusing but no one can deny the fact that at it worst it still huge step above other comic book movies it really has the guts to say something and just that alone makes it at the very least unique experience as far as comic book movies go it rich complex masterfully directed work of art with incredible acting cinematography pacing music action all of it you should really watch the movie it definitely worth it1.0\texceptional this movie is the exact description of what batman movie should look like this movie has finally done justice to the fans rush to you nearest theatres and watch it you won regret what performance by robert pattinson this guy has finally shown what he is capable of1.0\tthe batman 2022 my review will contain the categories acting directing and story acting 10 the acting of this new batman movie has improved alot since the disastrous release of dc batman vs superman that alone is good thing robert pattinson as bruce wayne was very lovely to watch im surprised but he always had that charm so im very happy for him his acting was like younger version of christian bales batman the dark knight which is very good the penguin reminded me of the penguin from the video games batman arkham the penguin felt very rich of power and like mobster which he is felt like if the penguin was real man this version of the penguin is the closest one we have got lastly the riddler just wow acting was definetly 10 10 on this one just go watch this movie bet you he will creep you out very good choice of cast for this role and really enjoyed darker version of this character directing 10 the music was good even great however it annoyed me that the same intro song kept playing after every scene like maybe just change the melody or song for some scenes however still good music so 10 in general the movie was very dark when say dark mean darker than the dark night the movie felt like if the batman universe was real this is what it would look like city looked awesome very similiar to new york it felt like scary scorcese movie but with superheroes kind of lastly just wanna say you will love the intro for the batmobile just wow story 10 story was good kind of fresh it wasnt boring but could get depressing at some points however the music and characters kept you interested enjoyed this movies version of the catwoman she and batman had good bond lastly this movie felt like scary mobster detective movie yes said it it wasnt bad tho promise really think you should watch this movie if you like creepy detective movies and if you love batman of course hope you liked my review all the best1.0\tfrom acting to amazing cinematography everything in the batman is nothing but pure art this is certainly new look for the classic comic hero but it not an unwelcome one this version of batman offers gothic realistic look at the cape crusader taking characters that were often overlooked and simply being described as comedy relief riddler and penguin to whole new level the soundtracks are out of this world and the actions scenes one in particular are amazing perfect batman movie1.0\tfirst of all they have let the riddler outsmart the batman second is this worth like the joker outsmarting the batman in tdk answer is no third the movie starts with promising story but in the end it ends like any other superhero movie that where we feel like the production house have compromised on story and they didn want to experiment any fresh ideas1.0\tthis movie is incredible robert pattinson was perfectly casted for this role he was able to portray so many beautiful emotions in his character which worked extremely well with the storyline zoe kravitz was an amazing cat woman she portrayed strong and indipendent character and her chemistry with pattinson was just beautiful all of the casting in this movie in my opinion was perfect everybody role was perfect for them and really made the storyline incredible overall amazing movie loved the cinematography and how dark the overal movie was guessing there will be sequel very excited to see that1.0\tmiss heroes like this so dark love it and one more thing like watching detective movie really like and recommend this movie can wait and very curious for the next movie dc you can do it1.0\tthe batman takes heavy influences from the dark knight and the long halloween but is able to create its own unique stamp on the batman mythos thanks to the brutally dark world reeves has crafted and pattinson stoic portrayal of the caped crusader1.0\tthis is the first batman movie where batman gets significantly more screen time than bruce wayne that made this an enjoyable movie just like in the comics you saw batman more than an out of costume bruce wayne christopher nolan trilogy did decent job with this but this film took it to the next level watched this on hbo now and glad did feel the pacing could have been better so only they could have cut this down to hours 20 minutes pretty easily1.0\tthe batman character never runs out of stories and this one is one of the best if not the best one yet think all the actors do great job the movie is visually beautiful and the score is incredible what gets me the most though is the pacing it bit slow but it very consistent and well done the movie never fully stopped and lost my attention it constantly through new ideas and new plot points even in the most quiet and what should be uninteresting moments because of this the movie is incredibly tense there constant aura that is so chilling which amplifies the impact of fight scenes drastically im really glad this even darker take on batman worked and curious as to how they can continue the revived franchise1.0\toz was the best for me beutifull colors and sound though the story could have been more deep in the beginning there is alot to work with from here jugding from the end1.0\tin summary the batman offers us one of the most artistically striking batman productions ever made with its incredible cinematography story acting and atmosphere and aims to start new breath for the dc universe when both matt reeves and batman hunger for movies came together very meticulous job emerged and it was clear that he worked hard on every frame if you want to watch batman movie that is different from other batman movies and takes place in the se7en universe can clearly recommend this batman movie for you to watch in the cinema although there are aspects that criticize and dislike it was definitely production worth seeing for me1.0\tthe batman 2022 superhero movies have always been topic of fiery debates and while some people love them others consider them to be substandard movies nolan dark knight trilogy came out before the general craze and it felt elevated above the conventional amusement park nature of the genre the batman on the other hand was released in the midst of superhero saturation and managed to not only rise above convention but also to top his predecessor in both grit and realism it wasn just grounded it seemingly went underground the batman is up noir detective story without any superhero flashiness which feels more like mix of joker se7en and zodiac however it still is batman film set in the grim gotham city with iconic characters being represented as they have never been before for decades batman has been portrayed as nearly inhuman combatant ready to dispatch any foe with an array of gadgets this on the other hand is unlike any batman movie because of how rugged and lifelike it feels whether you look at the costume or the general menacing atmosphere despite being gritty detective story it never feels boring due to plenty of riveting action and genuine suspense the detective element is taken extremely seriously with proper mystery clues and investigations of the heinous crimes colin farrell is absolutely unrecognizable as darkly charismatic villain who never overreaches into becoming ridiculous the greatest standout though is the riddler who feels like proper psychopathic villain with eccentric mannerisms that gives feeling of serial killer documentary aesthetically the movie looks fantastic with meticulous use of darkness and colors to create an adequate ambience supported by heart pounding music my only problem is the miscasting of john turturo who plays key villain and yet all could see were his previous comedic performances sadly jeffrey wright felt like he was lost in this film if you are wondering about pattinson though he nailed it as both batman and bruce wayne this film might not be better that tdk but it is still brilliant achievement as both the comic book adaptation and work of cinema movies shmovies on instagram for honest movie and tv show reviews0.0\ttried too hard to be dark and gloomy film admire the attempt but disappointed with the execution very good casting but some of the plot was being dragged along by an unfulfilling finale build up1.0\tstarts okay builds very nicely but then completely drops the ball at the end it does sag little in the middle too bit over long could have been better edited but once again in the end it all just lets itself down the issue is remarkably limited amount of tension building especially towards the end something get set up mystery but then as soon as all is revealed it rather naff outcome want to drop it more stars but did very much like the vast majority of the film and am hopeful towards forthcoming movies this being part or believe anyway watch it you may just like the ending whole lot more than did the friend went with couldn understand my issue with the end of it perhaps it just bit of lazy writing and can seem to help picking up on things like that1.0\tuber dark take from matt reeves that requires anti depressants and sizeable dose of warm sunshine pattinson is an outstanding batman exuding genuine menace and intimidation as he lurks miserably in the shadows his emo version of bruce wayne is all smudged eye shadow and teenage angst perhaps this petulant bruce will demonstrate semblance of maturity in the inevitable sequels the bat is dealing with multiple villains in this cesspool none creepier than dano riddler who manages to deeply upset everyone with his bizarre screeching zodiac style clues and gory murders farrell is unrecognisable but very good as the penguin while kravitz slinks around looking amazing but not really achieving much where reeves really succeeds is in world and mythology building the film is epic and vast painting gothic nightmare that is semi realistic is it more epic than nolan yes more entertaining no give me playboy bruce with sense of humour over this misery guts any day 100.0\tbad story terible badman he is breaking down the badman worse guy to play the epic story of badman waist of hours cant beleaf the dint the put great actor in the movie time to remove the movie for new one thank god dint pay for it will ask my money back if did1.0\twhen robert pattison was announced as the next batman remember the internet going all up in arms over the news as always personally rooted for him and stayed optimistic because all wanted was good batman movie am not disappointed my opinion might change adjust with time but having seen the movie twice in cinema can say that to date this is probably my favourite live action batman the gadgets characters and action seem grounded and realistic while maintaining sort of batman feel to it unlike the nolan movies which felt bit for lack of better word sterile gotham is dark and gothic the action is brutal yet batman has to struggle through it and can be ganged upon it is not an invincible superhero but guy with enough willpower and resolve to keep going what is most important at last we got detective story batman is afterall first and foremost the worlds greatest detective yet this aspect of the character has been often sidetracked in favour of action in previous incarnations what is not to be forgotten is the beautiful cinematography score and sound design seeing the car chase and hearing that engine roar in dolby atmos excited pure glee owerall rate this movie 15 10 if could1.0\tthe batman was fantastic the cinematography was amazing right off the bat pun intended gotham had dull always raining tone it just straight up felt like the best live action gotham in any movie with the slums in batman begins as about the same vibe in my opinion but much smaller in nolan all the main leads did fantastic batman gordon catwoman penguin and the riddler very different than any version but worked well with the very grounded and realistic tone of the movie story was incredible it was long movie coming to about hours but it never felt like it was dragging the story always had that what going to happen next momentum giving you that investment batman himself also was incredible loved how they made it point to show how he has lot of gadgets and actually uses them throughout this is younger bruce wayne only years into batman and it was shown well in how he was actually taking some brutal beatings and not just an untouchable god and get this he was doing quite bit of actual detective work but still learning not the worlds greatest detective just yet which makes it just very real and another thing if you are fan of the comics you will be pleasantly surprised this heavily pulled from some of the best batman comics and was fun for fan like myself to catch them1.0\tthis is the perfect batman movie till date which revolves around only batman and his struggles fighting with his ego and perplexity in his life very comic accurate movie shows the darkness of gotham and its increasing crime with deep pockets of politics1.0\tthe show is unbelievably great great example of mystery and noir fiction it is surprisingly similar to the movies se7en and zodiac just love how the riddler mind was unreadable and unpredictable batman never knew single thing about his plans the movie itself is fuelled with mysteries it never failed me to grab my attention on every single detail about it would love to see this type of batman movie again darker and grittier batman with its true colors during his vigilantism 10 101.0\tthe build up and the wait is over got to see the movie last night in imax and it was beyond my expectations pattinson and the way reeves portrayed him is next to none all the characters played key intriquet roles especially the riddler and batman any fan of the comics that have actually read and enjoyed the comics will love matt reeves direction on our new dark knight1.0\tit good movie although it hard to get into nolan world plus the movie is linear and with few surprises beyond the script give it since it lacked more anticlimax0.0\tperhaps this movie suffered for me from some of its own hype before seeing this was told this was the most comic accurate version of batman by people who clearly have not read the comics riddler here is nothing like he is in comics he is presented as more intelligent than batman but this is due to batman being poor detective rather than riddler being hyper intelligent batman is depicted the same in and out of costume as an emo nirvana loving muscle car enthusiast an odd choice as never knew anyone to be emo and love working on cars robert pattinson is as wooden as brie larson in this film from start to finish but perhaps this is the good acting keep hear associated with him the movie does have style you could say created by color filters used in very dimly lit rooms and just about every scene reminds you of another better made movie this will not age well1.0\tthe hour movie run time is completely worth it mature dark and gritty movie it amazing robert pattison as batman is the best we have seen and also plays great younger bruce wayne and is the best casting choice which just pips bale collin farrell was fantastic as the penguin and the make up used on him is so good you can even recognise him zoe kravitz as selina kyle catwomen is the best we have seen she originally audition for the role in the dark knight returns which questions need to be asked why she didn get the role back then paul dano is amazing as the riddler gotham city actually looks and feels like gotham from the comics the music and the cinematography are outstanding can get the theme out my head can wait to get more batman movies0.0\tam officially batmen ed out everything in this movie had been done before though like paul dano the riddler was just recreation of the joker scarecrow from the nolan trilogy the organized crime schtick was beaten to death in the dark knight movies as well the penguin is just trope from every martin scorsese film the plot line of an imperfect thomas wayne that was immediately retconned was such waste of time andy serkis was an underutilized alfred and zoe kravitz is not good catwoman it was an hour too long and had about or ending scenes but the movie just never seemed to end warner brothers need to invest in different franchise and stop beating this dead horse hope to not see another batman film for another 10 20 years0.0\tthis movie was just remake of earlier ones with new villain but same plot line detective work by batman was below par the cast were good but were not supported by the weak script expectations were high but sadly this movie is too long hopefully sequels will be more fun ps the batman movie announcement by previous batman actor in 2016 should have been green lighted1.0\tit is top tier batman film and top tier comic book film it true detective story which batman needed every actor is phenomenal but the stars are robert pattinson as batman dano as the riddler and jeffrey wright as gordon gotham feels like it own city again the action is very dynamic and there is no filler any negative review must have seen something else this will easily be seen as the best film of 20220.0\tbad tiresome dark sad depressing slow boring pointlessly long few dialogues too loud dismal music the whole movie could be summed up in 12 minutes1.0\tit everything you want in super hero movie felt so proud seeing robert pattinson get all the accolades that he deserves thanks matt reeves for giving us the best super hero movie of all time0.0\tfirst of all the acting is what makes this movie tolerable to all those fans who say have you read comics this is supposed to be this is the best guys this is not comics this movie how slow it can be copying the screen play instead of story from comics hour 45 mins for hour 30 minutes story excited for goosebumps scenes but there is only two or three totally if you were in verge of complete boredom and you couldn find anything watch this1.0\tthat song something in the way comes in starting and ending of the movie simply touched my heart very intelligent and unique cinema everyone should try it it okay if you didn watched dc movies the batman this name itself is enough promise you that you will come out with smile1.0\twas skeptical about robert being able to pull off batman but wow was amazed the riddler was spot on and perfect love they didn make batman with super gadgets just real vibes love love love how dark it was love that bruce wayne wasn flashy and didn care about money recommend everyone watch this and will watch again1.0\tvery well filmed nice camera angles different take on the batman universe good acting good action wasn bored at all and it didn feel too long anybody giving this movie or etc out of ten really doesn have clue what they are talking about1.0\tand can see that matt reeves truly cares to make great batman movie he understands how gotham city is literally hell on earth due to the corruption and surrounding danger he understands the depth of the villains in this adaptation of batman he understands the chemistry between batman and catwoman he understands how ominous mysterious and gritty his presence is supposed to be because matt reeves understands batman every action scene is was great because of how it was being shot no need for over edited nonsense nor shaky cam even if it was handheld in some or most action sequences surely couldn tell the cinematography is beautiful yet dreadful which is what sets the right mood for batman adaptation what mean by that is that if anyone wants to make batman adaptation whether if it movie animated movie video game another comic book etc you got to have the right ambience for what makes the scenery in any batman adaptation gloomy eerie and yet touching to admire this one for sure knocks it out of the park when it comes to ambience in scenery or cinematography and these villains my god how great they were riddler being the limelight of this movie is of course unsettling and being taken serious penguin is funny yet scary catwoman is still the same catwoman we all know and love lastly robert pattinson makes perfect batman great delivery robert pattinson am so excited to see what else evolves in this universe of batman1.0\tthis movie is amazing just flat out amazing the cinematography is great the score is great the characters are great and the plot is great the batman is hell of movie it focuses more on the world greatest detective aspect of batman and its very dark gritty and noir enjoyed this movie very much and personally think it the best batman movie ever1.0\treally very nice movie it shows sides of batman that no other movies didn show as fan of the arkham videogame series loved this movie so much so that saw it twice in the cinema in one week highly recommended1.0\tmatt reeves the batman is slowed peaced crime movie with some action elements it was nice experience watching batman as detective doing detective work and slowly unfold the mystery about the riddler and his own family do not like to compare movies but cannot help myself either if you are into crimes thriller movies such as seven or spiral this movie has some similarities the side characters were also interesting however the love interest with selina kylie felt forced and uneccassery for the story to undfold there were plenty of villains where the riddler was the main antagonist man they did him justice and him and batman defently stole the show compared to the other great actor in the movie good antagonist is often the oppposite ideal of the protagonist however in this case the work for the same cause but in different ways this leads to great character development of batman in the end where he is forced to question why he is batman and what does the bat stand for1.0\tthis hours long dark and depressing adaptation of batman show us the confused and depressed inner self of bruce wayne in his first years as batman without any jokes depressing mood imperfection and most importantly the most detective work in any batman films this movie is absolutely outstanding through batman without insane gear who tends to fail lot the imperfect camera quality with interesting camera angles capturing gotham that actually feels like gotham and an absolute terrifying serial killer like riddler who is like hannibal lecter and jigsaw combined matt reeves created batman movie that not only looks like comic but at the same time is more realistic than any other batman movie yet really recommend watching it think it is masterpiece1.0\tabsolutely loved this film right from the opening scene knew this was going to be good watch the plot is interesting combined with the slower pacing which allows you more time to see bruce do some investigation into the riddler and solve his puzzles patterson performance as batman and wayne was brilliant and love the vibe he brings to the character to make it his own the cinematography for this film was beautiful so many shots looked so incredible and the fight scenes were such joy to watch this was heavily helped by the choreography as batman is lot more athletic and acrobatic then previous iterations which allows for some really intense and brutal fights exactly what want from batman film although controversial really appreciated the riddler in this film dano aloof meniacle demeanor creates an air of mystery and uncertainty as what his next moves are as he genuinely seems like disturbed individual wright played great gordon not as good as oldman but definitely not bad portrayal by any means it just that oldman set such high bar thought the farrell as penguin was also well done but deserved some more screen time which is my only gripe with the film the batmobile and his batsuit both have rugged and jagged aesthetic which although is subjective really thought they looked fresh and very different to what we ve previously seen from this character to conclude definitely think this film is worth your time and think you ll absolutely love it too1.0\tthis movie is awesome the visuals sound design acting and direction are executed at top notch level love the noir aesthetic of gotham city the fight scenes are brutal and the best out of any batman movie only gripe have is with the way bruce wayne is depicted as an emo soft spoken recluse get what they are doing they are trying to show how much bruce wayne is affected by his childhood trauma but think good batman movie needs contrast between batman and bruce wayne at the end of the day the character of batman plays bruce wayne bruce wayne is batman mask all of bruce wayne antics as playboy millionaire are needed for the character that how he keeps up appearances in public and it how he deals with his trauma also this distinction makes it harder for some random joe to put two and two together about bruce wayne being batman it would have been cool seeing that side of bruce wayne and the way in which robert pattinson would approach that still best batman movie since the dark knight it must see1.0\tthe batman is movie of gotham and its corruption matt reeves takes enough time in almost every scene to make you feel and sit through the emotion and makes you feel the weight robert pattinson is great if not the best batman he brings the sense of fear to the character with just walking towards the camera this is as much selina story as it is gotham and batman zoe did fantastic job of portraying selina1.0\tmy wait of over year half became worth it so glad it did my gosh the action sequences the car chase were so brilliantly written directed1.0\tthe batman is filled with excitment and the story is written well for superhero movie the acting of the characters are amazing the riddler is terrifying when he came it truly scary1.0\tbest batman hands down love the dark tone and the characters in the movie this movie is 10 10 for me this film was unique in so many ways unlike some other movies have seen since snyder cut it had the perfect dark dc tone and was just perfect1.0\tthe batman juxtaposed beautiful visuals with enigmatic characters and captivating story together to more than justify its existence matt reeves director of the beloved planet of the apes films proves this was his passion project each scene is piece of art on screen perfectly exploiting the environment to push the story forward reeves has done world building establishing gotham in different look and demeanor than any previous iteration this movie is dark and bleak utilizing black grey and red color palette it film noir detective thriller centered around damaged young bruce wayne searching for his place in the grim reality of crime ridden gotham themes of corruption integrity and justice fill this heavy script at 2hrs 55min it the longest of the string of bat films up to this point yet you barely feel it the pacing and editing is orchestral especially due to the immaculate score michael giacchino is solidifying himself as one of the greatest composers and this is one of his most memorable soundtracks the acting performances are superb across the board zoë kravitz mesmerizes john turturro surprises paul dano terrifies and colin farrell is unrecognizable the enigmatic bruce wayne himself robert pattinson has earned his place as he delivers bat worthy performance he able to convey so much through minimal dialogue with his eyes and facial expressions additionally the beautiful cinematography and production design make gotham essentially another character which adds more depth to the film every action sequence and dialogue exchange is built with tension and mystery due to excellent direction matt reeves has produced his vision of the caped crusader and although it easy to start comparing to the goat the dark knight it strongly stands on its own overall the batman gives us new and exciting take on the timeless comic book character it story that encompasses all the darkness of bruce wayne in detective noir film which brings the audience into the relentless damaged and heroic psyche of the bat who scares from the shadows te 221.0\tfrom start to finish was hooked everything from direction story action music and acting was extremely well done robert pattinson portrayal of the batman bruce wayne is the best ve seen since christian bale version and he had amazing chemistry with zoe kravitz catwoman who was fabulous paul dano riddler was so terrifying and ruthless making him great main villain of the film it definitely ranked up there as one of my favourite movies ever hats off to matt reeves for his incredible script and direction really hope we get the planned trilogy with matt reeves returning to direct them all definitely give this 10 100.0\tthe movie was boring and very cliche the cast is weak and didn work for me at all feels like 1966 batman edgelord version acting is uninspired its wannabe se7en copy better leave this stuff to fincher he knows what he is doing and oh god those costumes are just the worst really big downgrade from the dceu movies that ironhead studios worked on0.0\tthen woke ruined it enjoyable then bang its tume to put tge film off is there any need for the virtual signals glad didn go cinema to watch this nolan trilogy was the best1.0\tthis movie exceeded my expectations and robert pattinson delivered as different kind of batman initially doubted his portrayal as bruce wayne but he did good job but they easily could have cut off 45 minutes without losing any storyline it was just unnecessarily long and slowed the movie down1.0\tnot the worlds massive batman fan lost never really likes the dark knight series so going to see this was expecting too much the film is perfection the story was paced brilliantly never had dull moment music was good acting was brilliant actors who stood out were farrell and dano was use to the original penguin but now farrell under all the latex pulled off performance rarely seen dano if could give him the oscar now would no more comical green suits but horror serial killer please give him film on his own as the riddler if you are one of those people who go the loo lot at film book an aisle seat it nearly hours long1.0\thaving been huge fan of the batman trilogy by nolan must admit how beautifully amazed was with how relatable the whole city scenario felt robert has built the character throughout the movie which feels like an authentic journey of superhero the whole movie is set after the sunset and that gives it stand up with the dark theme the story and inclusion of cat woman adds on unlike the earlier random cat woman characters every actor is top cast in the film and the story develops throughout and this is perfect detective movie authentic batman film indeed1.0\thave to admit that wasn convinced when they announced that pattinson was attached to the project despite being an amazing actor couldn see him as batman well one thing for sure was completely wrong he is so charismatic in the role that couldn get my eyes off him what performance overall the movie was good and visually stunning though sometimes few shots didn make sense what bothered me were the lack of very good fight scenes they were too few and poorly choreographed and ridiculous too realistic to my taste for dc comics movie as for catwoman and the penguin it didn work for me pfeiffer and devito can be beaten afraid was really disappointed in the music too repetitive which stopped me from being 100 in the movie pisses me off when they don keep the original themes that we all know and love giacchino is an amazing composer spider man soundtracks are phenomenal but was quite bored on this one0.0\tthis has to be probably the worst batman movie ve ever seen the movie is absolutely boring no emotion no nothing only darkness which makes the movie so hard to see and understandable definitely dc has no clue on how to make super hero movie this is disaster do yourself favor watch the series from the 60 it will be more fun than this one1.0\twill try to make this quick and add no spoilers to the movie this movie is more targeted to 16years and over it very dark and it how batman should be everyone is going to compare this movie to christopher nolan batman trilogy which is hard to beat and why it shouldn be compared is other batman movies are big action sequences entertainment over the top this movie is more of thriller mystery and not so over the top for me was lot better then batman begins and other batman movies except the dark night with health leadger and the dark night raisers cinematographer of this film is amazing it all elmo the acting is fantastic just needed more of the riddler this movie may be little disturbing to some people but the first 20mins of the film you can tell it not your usual batman movie found it little boring within the last 30mins of the film and in some parts also found it so exciting for the first 60mins of the film1.0\tmy hopes might have been little too high for this one after seeing the trailers but its still very good movie robert pattinson knocks it out of the park as socially awkward batman his bruce wayne unfortunately isn as successful jeffrey wright and colin farrell both are great and wanted to see more of both of them paul dano chews the scenery as the riddler zoe kravitz and john turturro are both only ok as femme fatale selina kyle and crime boss carmine falcone andy serkis was underused as what looks to have been very interesting take on alfred the film is long dark and has pretty interesting mystery but almost doesn feel long enough batman actually has to use his detective skills for once in movie which was nice to see it definitely has the vibe of zodiac or se7en the score for this film by michael giacchino is amazing be surprised if heard better score this year1.0\tgod there so much want to write about this movie but ll try to sum it up everything about the design of this movie is absolutely perfect gotham is filthy and dark the costumes are imposing and realistic the cinematography is absolutely beautiful and the score ties all these together in an absolutely incredible way the characters are perfect too paul dano riddler is terrifyingly perfect catwoman is as seductive as she is heart driven and skillful gordon is great buddy to batman and shines against the filth in the gcpd and pattinson gives the single best live action batman portrayal that have ever and maybe will ever see even the batmobile is perfect in this movie acting like demonic predator during the best chase scene ve ever watched with all of this mixed into dark gritty detective mystery for plot it shines as my favorite batman movie of all time1.0\tunmatched best superhero film ever made it was moody gritty and dark with keeping batman character intact the visuals complemented the story perfectly loved gotham vibe altogether every character introduction shot will get you hyped the batman learns towards the end of the movie that his vengeance will also have to be within the best interest of the citizens he has to be compassionate towards the people meanwhile also delivering justice in the crime ridden streets of gotham this film is must watch 10 100.0\treally bad acting bad portrayal of batman bruce wayne alfred and pretty much everyone there was bit of wokeness but it could have been worse it long and drawn out dark scenes shaky camera pretty much every bad thing you can think of after the christian bale movies the bar is so high they should hang up the batman franchise for awhile0.0\tthe entire movie was italian ascent what are you doing or what are you talking about saying dialogues failed to leave lasting impression of any sort direction style tried to copy or mimick sin city but failed sharply definitely the worst batman movie of 2000s1.0\tcoming from someone who doesn even consider batman as one of my favorite super hero this is exactly what the batman should be did enjoy the nolan films and obviously tdk but let be honest the one thing that makes tdk as good as it is is the joker ledger without doubt made pretty good movie into classic one which is why most would say it the best batman movie but this film is what the batman is for years there was always talk about how we were to get the detective side of batman and then got scene or two of him dusting some prints no no no he supposed to be the worlds greatest detective and this movie actually makes you believe that he at all these big crime scenes notices clues before the police can solves riddles faster than anyone else it like mix of seven and saw there are times where this thing feels like horror movie and this is by far the darkest batman we ve seen compared to the nolan films that nothing up until now affleck was probably my favorite batman loved the anger brutal combat and the fact that he just wants to beat the hell out of people typa batman what pattinson brings is exactly that but carries it into his bruce wayne side the thing is there is no bruce wayne side he is straight up batman he doesn put on this fake billionaire persona but he does it perfect and with little to no words just from his face you can see how broken sad and angry he really is there are scenes where he doesn have to say word and it like he telling you everything he feeling he nailed it this is also by far the most realistic batman film ever being as this is his 2nd year in as batman you can see it he kinda sloppy and takes some beating but he fights out of pure rage and anger and it great everything from the batmobile to the gadgets it actually seems like something him and his butler could create he even has flying squirrel looking suit when jumping off building because ya know jumping off 30 story building with cape is kinda sketchy also the villains in this are great the riddler definitely ranks at the top of batman movie villains for me the penguin is also supposed to get spin off show which really looking forward to his character is really good in this as well catwoman is great in this too you get to see the bat and the cat in action which is really nice last but not least gotham mean this place is character by itself you get to actually see and feel how much of trash city gotham really is it unlike any other gotham we ve seen before could probably keep going but for now good bye1.0\tcool movie love this version till the end of the film very appreciate to all of this film actor when you see this film you will get new story about bruce wayne and the city so dark and love this fantastic film of the year1.0\thave been calling for robert pattinson to play batman for the last few years never once thought live in world where that would happen boy am glad do amazing film from start to finish dark gritty mysterious amazing acting all round love it showing the detective side of batman and the tormented side also can fault this film as my title says epic1.0\tthis is just great on every aspect cinematography writing acting it so dark and gritty know people complain about the length but to be honest it just perfect it doesn feel rushed it takes its time 10 101.0\tthe first of the movie where phenomenal the cinematography and the shots were so artistic sometimes forgot that was watching the movie because was staring at these beautiful shots robert pattinson performance was amazing always wanted more gloomy batman to hit the big screen the supporting cast is as good but in the third act something was bit off bit rushed might say riddlers plan was bad and so was the thing with his accompanies wish we got more riddler and more of the gotham corruption if it was like that have given the movie 10 10 pretty easily too1.0\tunfortunately didn get to see this movie in the cinema it would have been amazing to see on the big screen but seeing it on the small screen was still very enjoyable the batman is great movie that builds and establishes this new dc world its dark gritty and very realistic not quite as real as chris nolan movies but close enough matt reeves does brilliant job at directing this as you would expect from someone of his skills he can really make gritty intense movie while this movie does feel slow in some parts and the runtime can feel like drag the movie never really gets boring and that thanks to the very artistic feel of the movie the cinematography is stunning it is by far the most beautiful looking superhero movie in very long time you casn tel matt truly took his time to make this and has straight forward vision the cast in this movie is the highlight robert is amazing as batman his screen presence is perferct and his body movements and fight scenes are just right now say he amazing as batman because well bruce wayne isn in this film its batman from start to finish and this movie makes it perfectly clear that bruce is pretty much non existent here robert plays this grim bruce very well and you can tell that bruce isn comfortable outside his batman suit since he always in basic clothing and his hair isn taken care off it really sets the character up well for furture development dano as the riddler was also perfect casting choice he brillant actor that is master at playing the weird nutjob and here is no exception while we don really get to see him his actions carry this movie and he gives off john doe vibe from se7en which works well for this film every other cast memeber does great job from zoe to jeffrey and john turturro then there is colin farrell as penguin if someone has said good looking man like colin can play one of the most disgusting looking villians out there would say no chance but by god they make it work colin is flawless that it flawless there is nothing to fault his performance just wish he was in the movie little longer but it looks like we will get more of him in future projects the batman is great movie while very slow paced it has an overly long runtime but has brilliant acting directing visuals and music this movie may not be for everyone especially if they are expecting to see an action packed superhero film with mindless action and boring leads with no vision1.0\tfrom the very start the movie sets the tone and the stakes of what to come packed with loads of action intense dialogues exceptional vfx sound breaking music and great villain exploring the second year of the masked vigilante he has to deal with riddle mystery and advance his detective abilities well made beginning of vast universe waiting to see what is to come after dark tease for the future of batman the film has also amazing performances not just from the main characters but from everyone involved1.0\tit slow paced dark and intriguing movie we follow the batman as he is trying to catch the riddler like detective or pi it superhero movie with no super powers no goofy funny scene no flashy special effects this movie has it own tone and doesn look like any other superhero movie and that exactly why it works dc movies work best when they re not trying to be like marvel and forget everything you know about robert pattinson he was made for this1.0\talmost hours but the pace in decent had somewhat average expectations especially since ben affleck was really poor batman and overall justice league made the franchise back to average at best this is hours dark thriller with real long police like investigation the cast delivered great performance wish we saw more andy serkis alfred and mr oz colin farrell there will be some batmans in the 2030 and 2040 but this one will be among the best1.0\tthe batman is finally here this is movie that have been following and looking forward to since day when learned that the inspiration for this movie was based on two of my favorite batman comics batman year one and long halloween this is the batman movie we want and the batman movie we deserve mix of zodiac se7en really love nolan take on batman and grew up with his batman movies so those movies is always gonna have special place in my heart but this is the batman grew up with reading about in the comics raw dark ruthless and mysteries hero that became known as the worlds greatest detective and solved crime in dirty run down and corrupt gotham that is the batman know and that is exaclty the batman we got in this movie and loved every second of it this is by far the best adaptation of batman so what did think of pattinson as batman he was great he had kind of kurt cobain vibe going on there and he really nailed the voice of batman and paul dano did an excellent job as the riddler but it was zoe kravitz as catwoman colin farrell as the penguin and john turturro as the mob boss carmine falcone that really stole the show1.0\tll be honest right when saw the first trailer of this movie knew it was going to be good watch it sure did turn out to be it dark thrilling action is good background music is brilliant and the acting by all main characters is good specially robert pattinson really hope he plays batman in few movies from here on he looked the part his voice was great too watch it and you won be bored yes the length could ve been chopped by 20 mins or so but it doesn drag enjoy this in theatre it worth it1.0\tit was an amazing experience the film had action mystery and distinctive symbolism the cinematography was fabulous and the acting was excellent the batman was worth the wait1.0\ttaking inspiration from batman year one comics watched the animated movie though matt reeves created an incomparable suspense thriller action masterpiece the cast acting cinematography bgm everything was more than perfect the movie showed the real image of gotham city it mainly focused why batman is called the greatest detective of world haven watched the dark knight in theaters idk but for me this is much better than tdk experienced the movie in imax 2d english at inox south city mall and the experience was quite good want more from matt reeves in future hope the it sequel will beat records of tdk as always say only batman can beat batman spoiler alert you must not watch the post credit scene1.0\tlittle slow in establishing its story but very well done wasn sold at first when hearing robert pattinson in the title role eh he alright limited dialogue but fits the image in this dark world anything better than the earlier franchise players prior to nolan bale trilogy and ben affleck horrific portrayal have held the dark knight as the pinacle batman movie with health ledger incredible performance but this sits right there with it it maybe early in judging but perhaps the best take joker in its greatness all unto its own monumental classic this is another masterpiece and with the setup for sequel already feasting for with this unique and believably ideal take in the character just back from premier tonight but might be clamoring for return before end of the weekend about time dc gets it films quality grade1.0\tactors in this film that really stood out were john turturro falcons this actor performance is always genius and classy colin farrell penguin although his story arc was lacking and especially paul dino riddler great performes by all but these characters truly carried the film paul dino has so much range as an actor that am surprised he does not receive more recognition his performance as riddler was amazing and felt so many feelings ranging from fear to empathy for the character likejaquin phoenix joker you can see how monster was created with disturbing past and detailed character arc to boot1.0\tthe dark noir feeling from the 90s animated series the detective story from the arkham games and the brooding brutality from the comics the batman had it all0.0\tthe most irrelevant actor for the role except for the fact that he is not good actor the choice for the role is completely irrelevant and silly we have very good batman movie and we do not need another one1.0\tthis incarnation of batman shares the most resemblance to the comics if you liked year one you will like this interpretation of the detective overall the batman is an excellent movie and definitely stands out from the prior versions robert pattinson does spectacular job and deeply embodies his tortured role of the batman my only comment is that there is something slightly off about his portrayal of bruce wayne when not suited up in conclusion the batman is so dark that it almost feels like high quality horror movie this is the depth of darkness familiar in the comic books1.0\tif you are batman fan you will love this movie direction was 10 10 the story was very compelling and the performances were fantastic robert pattison is really good being batman and enjoyed the cast lot the pacing is very good and it is visually stunning1.0\tbatman is officially back this movie is masterfully directed matt reeves did what he rolodex by directing noir driven batman movie and boy oh boy does he deliver the story was amazingly written and the pace of the movie is great it could be long for others but personally love longer movies the cast was fantastic zoe kravitz did great job as selina kyle and she played that character so well robert pattinson did amazing as batman he can tell story with his eyes in this film loved colin farrells over the top penguin and he is just fully lost in this character actually had to say to myself this is colin farrell are you kidding me last but not least paul dano as the riddler was probably my favorite cast choice and he stole the show greg frasier does great job with his cinematography some of the shots felt like it was ripped right out of comic book page he delivered perfectly michael giacchino also delivers with the score go the film looking back at recent batman films he had tough path ahead of him amazing scores from hans zimmer james newton howard and danny elfman are not small names and michael seemed to make an original yet familiar score overall it was an amazing movie well grounded well directed amazingly made film it good to have another dark batman movie1.0\thave not seen anything similar to this movie before let alone any batman rendition the cast the story the soundtrack everything was impeccable didn have lot of trust in robert pattinson for this role nonetheless ve always seen him as great actor but boy did he prove me wrong he gave stellar performance major hats off to matt reeves for making this happen because this doesn feel like any batman movie we have ever seen before it is so dark almost like noir but you can feel everything the storyline is well crafted and extremely captivating along with amazing visuals so much so that you don even realize that this movie is three hours long 24 hours after the movie still in awe this movie is not kid friendly ve seen people leave the theatre with their children like 15 20 minutes into the movie1.0\tacting whether rp collins zoey jeffrey or anyone else paul dano batman detective skills batman character development batman car absolute must watch0.0\tthe movie wasn capable of delivering the feelings and thoughts of the batman the way it should even minimally it was obvious from the dark knight 2008 that they were trying to make batman look weak incapable and nobody even though the dark knight was marvelous they weakened the character in way that we couldn feel or see this movie ruthlessly crushed the character and made it disgusting they delivered completely emotional batman that is moved by fear and lack of persistence alfred character was weak as well the penguin with tacky character and that silly catwoman is recipe for failure the director didn use the minimum of his imagination to create scene to remember robert pattinson belongs to romance he has no place in hero movie this movie can be good only if it is intended to enliven batman in the next one but they should prepare their imaginations with the most creative ideas for that hope and only that give them star rating the ideas of the movie weren coherent and lacking the minimum of thinking just like the way wrote this review in rush incoherent irrelevant and inconsequential1.0\thad high hopes for this movie and it didn dissapoint would say this is the most realistic batman we ve gotten on the big screen really liked that it was more of detective movie and not just fighting which there is still alot of but thought they balanced it out great1.0\tdon take your time if your here means you need good suggestion that it worth your time or not and trust me if your batman fan or not after watching this you will go for it it is one of the best movie ever from superhero movies some people feel its to long but trust me it not like other superhero movies it beyond them0.0\tvery slow movie omg it dragged just wanted the movie to end agter awhile really felt it was drama movie disguised as action really don understand the hype almost feel asleep couple time beause got so bored worst batman movie ever1.0\t10 majority of the people that have watched this movie would give it above 10 the riddler was psychotic and did an excellent job bruce wayne robert patterson looks like bruce wayne and he dominated his performance with his physical facial expressions which were similar to past batman movies the overall graphics fighting scenes action parts were epic realistic for the most part and just as cool as ever go and see this movie0.0\tboring story with boring actors the only highlight was how hot catwoman is easy pay day for all those involved many of these superhero movies lack substance quality making it difficult to connect with the stories and characters1.0\tit outstanding wonderful interpretation and sound track very well done definitely it worth seeing it definitely recommend it to everyone that has being waiting for long to the new batman1.0\tbit sceptical at first but this is mystery and detective work at its best brilliant casting choice is great vibe is awesome take the mask characters away and it would still be an awesome watch batman is daaarrrkkk1.0\tabsolutely great experience expected very different super hero movie from matt reeves and that exactly what got that movie was all the way above my expectations an excellent noir vibe all around the movie keeping your eyes stuck on the screen for every second of it robert pattison was my favorite batman maybe the best one yet and tge whole plot was excellent1.0\tif you are expecting your usual corny batman movie this is not the film for you this movie is full of action suspense drama and for the intellectual keeps you thinking all the way to end although had doubts was very happy with pattinson portrayal of batman and colin as penguin is just wow unrecognisable would call this film the real batman nothing came across as unrealistic am one to fall asleep in slow short movies but this 3hr film kept me engaged from start to finish wanting more undoubtedly the best batman movie to date well done to the entire crew1.0\tthe batman sets itself apart from previous versions of the universe by showing us true detective story unlike anything we ve seen yet combining elements from classic batman stories including the long halloween hush year one and court of owls while also providing brand new story that will keep you guessing the whole time excellent performances by all around but especially by robert pattinson jeffery wright and zoë kravitz who is easily the best portrayal of catwoman yet excited to see where these characters go in the future the score of the movie is fantastic and does great job setting the tone of each scene only have two major complaints it seemed to have problems knowing how to end it it seemed to be wrapping up at one point only to continue for another 30ish minutes don get me wrong those 30ish minutes were fantastic and gripping when the movie was actually ending it seemed to have three different closing shots almost as if they couldn figure out which one was the best way to close it so they threw them all in we didn get enough of andy serkis alfred serkis always is enjoyable to see but don think we got enough of him in the movie those two things are very minor though and still think the batman is close second to the dark knight as the best batman movie yet1.0\tthe batman is the greatest comic book film ever made let alone the best batman film matt reeves fleshes out unique and intense story drawing on several classic batman stories including the long halloween batman ego batman year one batman earth one batman zero year batman hush etc batinson was great what truly new and unique amalgamation of all these batman from across decades of stories he really did something special zoe kravitz as catwoman was excellent she plays year one selina kyle to the riddler was scary and was brought to life in new interpretation by paul dano this is not the tights or bowler hat riddler gotham city is the most unique it been since the burton verse wow gotham must be portrayed as character in in of itself and they did that masterfully imax is must this noir detective drama in the rain is perfect call back to batmans roots in his original detective stories the last thing cause could go on forever is the batmobile this will be the new iconic look for years to come much like each interpretation inspires the batmobile for generation this one is no different 10 out of 101.0\tthe dark knight is my favourite batman film but this comes close this is the closest batman movie has been compared to the comics they have finally done gotham right the riddler was incredible even if he wasn in the movie all that much batman in this was amazing the fight scenes incredible and seeing batman being detective instead of just fighting the bad guy was sight to see the teaser of hush could be good sequel the final 3rd of the film was joy to watch will be interesting to see where these films go from here and the stakes get raised1.0\tnot only is the my favourite batman movie it might just be my favourite movie of all time as die hard batman fan loved how they went back to his comic book roots his relationship with catwoman his team work with jim gordon consisting of good cop bad cop where he can do the brutal things that the law prohibits jim from doing how dark and run down gotham looked how he used fear to fight crime it was like what batman begins touched on but then never followed up with in the sequels they finally showed very smart batman and the world greatest detective the soundtrack was perfect as well as huge fan of hans zimmer never thought anyone would score batman movie better the whole casting was perfect too colin farrell zoe kravitz paul dano and jerffrey wright were stellar and pattison has over taken as the best batman from michael keaton in my opinion the next movie can come soon enough1.0\ttypical batman story crime investigation engaging the batman movie this batman movie is different from previous batman movies matt reeves as director and writer done excellent job most of the batman movies has perfect villians so batman side is not much focused but in this movie character arc for batman bruce wayne was very well portrayed and at same time movie had dominating and promising antagonist too batman lives double lifes in this more than bruce wayne side they mostly focused on batman side crime investigations was really intresting felt like se7en movie vibe action sequence were also well made pattinson as batman gave terrific performance paul dano as riddler had less screentime but created great impact zoe kravitz as catwoman done good job other cast really done their part well technically everything was topnotch cinematography every frames were very well crafted music mind blowing production design editing cgi were great overall must watch movie please don miss it to watch it on theater it completely gives you great experience1.0\tthis film feels like an step up version of what joker and whatever the snyder original vision for his superman is it is defiantly moodier but is able to stood its ground its story is relevant unlike joker while it ultimately let it go of its consequence it is at least thought through it gives an escape but still puts them accountable since they are complicit to it also enjoyed how the film took its time to really flesh out important characters and give them weight zoe kravitz is wonderful as the catwoman it is very great step up to almost all the version of catwoman that ever was it is strong sexual but without losing an inch of her own dignity colin farrell is marvelous yet undistinguishable as the penguin paul dano riddler is mostly good but found his last scenes bit uncomfortably over acted jeffrey wright is fine also also loved the route the story went it is not the typical style that tend to see with superhero films in fact it almost feels like film noir its mystery with lot of turns like that in addition the cinematography feels very inspired by watchmen and nolan batman films negatively have little to say though would definitely cut some walking shots here and there some even looks like straight out of 2010s edm mv ultimately the three hour runtime was definitely worth it very fantastic film would rewatch this is what think dc should go its very different thematically and style wise to what marvel is pushing out ps zoe kravitz freakishly looks like ariana grande in the club scenes lol pps love the stinky emo virgin batman that robpattz is giving out guess his edward days is still not over1.0\twhat great interpretation of batman thought pattinson did an amazing job can wait for sequel and hope they bring other amazing comic characters back to life as they did gripping and amazing job with the likes of the riddler penguin and cat woman will we see poison ivy joker and half face return to the big screen with pattinsons amazing batman facing them off hope so oh and that batmobile scene epic1.0\tve never been fan of the marvel style superhero movies as they lack degree of realism was big fan of nolan trilogy because he brought realistic perspective to the character this movie takes that realism even further where the hero doesn always stick the landing admits he can be everywhere at once and has self doubt however he still manages to portray batman as badass though he has obvious physical and emotional flaws he is human after all also appreciated the detective aspect to batman was so surprised at the performances because when heard of this version initially thought everyone was miscasted was thrilled to be wrong because pattinson surprisingly gives bale run for his money that saying lot kravitz always struck me as kind of list actress but she is the best version of selina kyle out of all the movies her fighting skills were amazing yet natural only know the villain from the girl next door but man he is way up there on the list only second to ledger did think it could have used little more action and some more fight sequences but what they did have was awesome overall one of the strongest versions of batman maybe second only to the dark knight1.0\tmatt reeves does good job creating new iteration of the batman character that is familiar to fans however unique enough to stand on its own you definitely do not need to know anything about batman or to have ever seen batman movie to follow this in this three hour story we see very very dark gotham city in the midst of murder plot involving the mayor this unfold more like detective story than superhero tale but that is part of the appeal the story is underpinned by stories of endemic and systemic corruption being revealed by paul dano riddler so is riddler villain or hero the movie does good job of showcasing the riddler the penguin and cat woman in ways that are not overtly cartoonish zoe kravitz is great in this movie even though think her character is little superfluous robert pattinson is good in the lead role although better as batman than as bruce wayne jeffrey wright good as commissioner gordon and john turturo is good as carmine falcon the cinematography and direction are top notch this is not my favorite batman am christian bale guy however this is very good0.0\tlot of chin acting and the usual cgi pish cannot imagine women would be pleased with some of their portrayals in the club scenes plot somewhat confused and convenient least an hour too long know we are encouraged to suspend belief for this type of film but you might be better suspending your attendance quite liked the discordant music score1.0\tthrilling detective story where batman actually is doing detective work the action is incredible also there is some horror elements in there an amazing ending truly brilliant1.0\tthis movie is awesome was getting so tired of superhero movies all feeling the same but the batman tilt stands out from the hyperstylized dc and the cookie cutter marvel films we ve been served in recent years besides joker and logan of course reeves had vision and he went for it the grit of gotham is real and lived in the trauma of bruce upbringing is truly explored the film truly soaks you in the world that is created truly excellent it may have felt little long for superhero film but it still left me wanting more in the end anyone who doubted pattinson is eating their words now and have also not seen anything he has been in in recent years good time the lighthouse and the devil all the time he is truly world class actor and he is finally getting the mainstream credit he deserves every other actor is fantastic in their role as well know it isn fair to compare this to the dark knight but it is definitely up there with nolan best1.0\tdc is based of detective comics which what inspired to be batman world best detective the batman finally got deep into the detective side of the character and how rookie batsy might make mistakes too which love to see how sometimes batman fail but redeem himself at the end the acting was phenomenal from all actors all of them the movie vibe is given me like se7en and zodiac with twist of batman and that doesn mean its not original its actually way different at the same time the visual actions are incredible and the soundtrack oh my goodness for god sake just go and watch it this movie will not feel hours even if it does feel it you will understand why even though there small flaws but the advantages shadows it thats movie and half1.0\tfinally movie that shows the real batman used to read batman back in the 90 and still have lot of gns this is batman finally wb nailed it1.0\tthe movie is just amazing to watch it is intense and the depth shown is seldom seen in superhero movies might be biased but what nwh achieved by taking the other spider men and 20 years this movie did but itself matt reves rob pattinson zoe kravitz and everyone else just know knocked it out of the park1.0\tthis film was good let me start with that before am downvoted into oblivion the casting was excellent robert pattinson has the batman voice down jeffrey wright as commissioner gordon was inspired and colin farrell disappeared into his character every performance in the whole film was phenomenal it was the writing and runtime that let it down zoe kravitz as catwoman was woefully underdeveloped and seemed unimportant shoehorned in to provide love interest andy serkis was great choice for alfred but was only there for two or three scenes same with paul dano when dano was on screen he was excellent he just wasn there all that much even with the hour runtime which flew by there wasn enough time to give these great actors the screen time they deserved still back to positives cinematography is crazy good it very different from what you usually see in film like this and was brilliant from the first frame to the last coupled with some excellent production design it helped give gotham real sense of character something it lacked since the burton films now that ve given another positive feel safe enough to add negative it glaring similarity to seven and zodiac whole scenes were ruined for me because watched both films and could see exactly what was going to happen it made film supposed to be filled with surprises as easy to predict as children book this shows to me worrying trend in dc films joker took two films by much celebrated director martin scorsese and then made them into superhero film the batman has done the same with fincher if hadn watched those two films feel this one would likely be nine instead it low there were other reasons the convenience of the utility belt and batsuit being one he never felt in real danger because anytime he needed something he had it on him the riddler felt conveniently written only as smart as the scene needed and his plan thought was inconsistent with his motivations now know sound like hate this film and don had wonderful time watching it and as said the three hours flew by just feel that everyone is ignoring the lows while celebrating the highs is this as good as the dark knight no is this as good as batman begins yes think it better it strong start for franchise and ll be there day one for the sequel but think it important we remember that this film isn perfect it overall enjoyable but has some major flaws 101.0\twhen saw this film was about hours it put me off bit but have to say it is great movie and warrants the time the acting is excellent plot is superb and the characters pitched just right this is not film all about shocks explosion and twists it is film about dark vigilante and the way it portrays batman is not as the super hero we have come to know he is far more human one of the film of the year so far0.0\tdon waste your time or money horrible batman horrible bat woman last checked bat woman had life struggle as an immigrant from cuba way to completely wash out that story line1.0\tthe story we all know but in more realistic view its still comic but the characters are better played and its cool to see lot of batman enemies in one movie don understand the rating of 12 year old because it has its dark brutal moments you don want to show you kids on that age can wait for the next one1.0\tthis is my first ever film review most movies these days aren good enough to even warrant reviews at all first off when it comes to films these days majority of them are quick cash grab or outright garbage produced by people who don know how to tell story properly and can figure out an endgame in relation to where they are going from beginning to end so am quite blunt and have no problem mocking movie for any stupidity or forced trope that gets tossed into cinema with that in mind the batman can be classed as an absolute masterpiece matt reeves delivers masterclass in noir horror detective storytelling while blending classic comics brilliantly this film kicks and it doesn stop kicking it nearly hours in length but it paced quite well so you don ever feel like you re sitting there watching you feel engaged as if you re also involved in solving the mysteries all characters own their role and you don just get left behind to observe like you re watching actors in portrayal at least in my opinion you sense you re watching actual characters in developed universe batman himself as character is more grounded than ever before with emotion you can perceive and genuine turmoil within while keeping his purpose intact there is vulnerability to him that you can actually identify with fans of an overpowered infallible never outclassed batman beware this is the character how he would truly exist in the real world with all the abilities and deficiencies natural man in suit and cowl would have without detracting from his gravitas his core beliefs or his world class forensic talent he is spectre in every way the same goes for riddler he is also ghost all his own and while flawed still delivers phenomenal performance that can be chilling and intriguing the action is purposeful and not overused so there is gravity and consequence when it is shown on screen the batmobile chase scene is intense you feel the engines the swerve and the collisions and this is coming from someone who hates chase scenes for how ridiculously unrealistic they are strong plot is extremely important and it is certainly present here and for lengthy film am pleased to say that it doesn get bogged down in overcomplexity and you never get lost trying to discern what is going on the cinematography is an experience the aesthetic and color palettes that reeves was going for was captured in way that made gotham appear comic accurate and simultaneously practical the score enriches each moment and gives the scenes momentum without distracting you from what you re seeing and has several variations of the main theme for different events this movie made nolan trilogy seem like an overpriced painting in an expensive art gallery for high maintenance patrons this film easily slides into the number one slot of batman movies of all time is easily re watchable and highly addictive and easily sets new standard of excellence for detective comics can stress this enough do not miss this vision story plot characters cinematography action execution entertainment value overall1.0\tin my opinion it was little dragged on as well as lacked action lot of the movie was slow doesn really seem like batman movie did enjoy it but when think about the dc universe believe that it doesn fit and pattinson doesn fit it either he played an alright batman but the movie was subpar at best1.0\treally like batman films but when saw the very first teaser immediately look away and thought this can be good but how wrong was super wrong the first 20 minutes of the film are work of art starting from the dark visuals to the excellent sound track cannot say bad thing about it it is three hour film and in the end wanted more the cast is amazing the very dark scenes are superb and the music is from another world don watch this on your phone0.0\tnot much batman about it emo batman plays detective in city where electricity bills are so hight even millionaire car afford to have lights on on any of the rooms not to mentione hospital buildings no character development for any of the characters not typical superhero movie there like good 3min action screne most others are seconds fights and lot of talking1.0\tliked this movie even though it didn have to be that long liked christopher nolan version much more from his very start it took me while to figure out what the heart of my problem with matt reeves version think it has lot to do with the very nature of batman as non super superhero what super about batman is his obsession or if you prefer his endless drive as character he probably the best character written down for dc comics but what makes him so relatable in the comics books makes him almost bland on screen broody obsessed and almost one dimensional christopher nolan realized that and spent lot of time depicting other sides of his character his youth his relations with girl that wasn part of the comics book his relations with his business partners and so on it allowed christian bale to build complete character matt reeves wanted his batman darker he made the riddler an insane sociopath into tormented soul gave catwoman deeper relationship with batman yes there always hinted attraction between her an batman there often open flirting by her mostly and there sympathy that batman has for her but only in the earth version they do get real thing going between them and as far as know we read about it but never see it in the comics as it happens basically reeves creates real fascinating character for catwoman which zoe kravitz does wonders with but he leaves batman almost as boring as he was when george clooney or michael keaton played him these movies were watchable because of stellar performances of those who played the villains and when those who played the villains were less than stellar the movies didn work at all so matt reeves does give us movie with great villains that is if you do call catwoman as he depicts her villain at all but john turturro as carmine falcone is also very good paul dano as the riddler is spending too long under full face mask leaving us with nothing but his voice when we do get to see him we get more of the insane and less of the tormented soul which is shame on the other hand reeves did create beautiful dark movie superbly shot with amazing lighting work he simply assumed we already know batman story too well so he omitted it from his longish movie but as result he didn give robert pattinson his chance to create complete character it mistake that both tim burton and joel schumacher made and schumacher failed with his villains too mainly when making batman and robin so reeves doesn do so bad but still after nolan version thought directors would learn how to do it better1.0\tdon remember ever watching such dark movie before the camera angles were shot great and the soundtrack of the movie connects you even more to the movie hours is long time but if it were plus more hours would watch the movie again greetings from turkey0.0\tfirst of all hated the batman suit hated that everyone walked and moved so slow in this movie and hated the constant narration of batman the action was mediocre and very little as they focused on batman just walking slow all other scenes of him is riding motorcycle or max max style batmobile which thought was horrible rendition didn like the military batmobile in batman begins but would have taken that over the camaro style batmobile in this version riddler was good but showed no semblance of the riddler we see in the comics just like bane was not the bane of the comics or video games in dark knight rises he puts on winter mask and wore glasses outside the mask with saran wrap around the back of his head who in the world developed this horrible vision of riddler someone who doesn like or read comic books guess next we have the batman did no one else want the part or did the director lose bet and had to use robert pattinson who resorted to being nothing more than emo character for the female viewers with his hair falling in front of his eyes when he was bruce wayne mean seriously move the hair please his acting was subpar as well felt forced most of the time and just wooden in most places andy serkis was great choice for alfred so that deserved star at least catwoman hmmm well they couldn afford to make mask or they ran out of funds so they just cut whole in ski mask and said try this on will you perfect no need to get creative or use that money she was decent catwoman but she couldn hold my attention very long skin tight suit and ski mask and of course her little rant of white privilege yup they checked all the boxes in this one caused me to just dismiss her character altogether found myself looking at my phone which is frowned on in movie theaters than watching this movie it was slow depressing checked all the boxes changed al the characters to fit the narrative and please the pc and leftist crowd and it tried too much to be like dark knight rises which it never could attain and it tried to be witty but turned out to be just another serial killer movie with guy in an awful batsuit with horrible action what little there was of it had low expectations walking into this one and left with even lower when was able to finally leave had been with just my wife and kid and should note here that my boy loves all movies with superheroes and loves batman but even he hated this one and said it was boring and even he wanted to leave we would have left after the first 20 30 minutes of torture my wife also loved the previous batman movies save the schwartzennegger and carrey movies for good reason but this one she despised the most like me would actually prefer the schwartzenneger movie over this one any day would even prefer the green lantern movie over this any day save your money and several hours watch the sunset read book watch the original batman movies these all have much more redeeming qualities than this sour lemon of movie you ll thank me later1.0\tdefinitely think so yes this film is lengthy however it truly didn feel that way to me was enthralled from start to finish between the noir aesthetics the score the acting the energy and the suspense was beyond satisfied with the batman still debating whether or not believe robert is the best to ever have been in cast in the role he brought such flawed dark edge to bruce wayne that christian bale did not however christian until now has been the exact image of how always imagined batman would be zoe is easily the best selina kyle and that shouldn be up for debate this is easily one of the best comic films ever created and anyone who disagrees is wrong1.0\tto really enjoy this you need to realize this is young batman in his first years he doesnt fit the batman style persona we see so often yet the major problem had with the film was the villian he was not well acted voiced or well written his motive and methodology changes completely and he starts doing things that really contradict his message with an average villian this movie would be so much better sad dont have more to say as am huuge batman fan1.0\twonderful movie hours long movie that what makes you to enjoy the movie the acting of robert pattinson did good job in this movie screenplay was good1.0\tabsolutely loved this film it started out with 1930 detective movie vibe which really liked robert pattinson was brilliant as bruce wayne batman as was andy serkis as alfred paul dano hit homerun as the riddler the whole cast did amazing the story was very engaging and kept me intrigued the whole hours simply can say enouph great things about this movie0.0\tdk why people are loving this movie so much there was no scene imo that worth whistling only reason even bothered watching this movie was robert pattinson was really thrilled to watch him play batman but the movie sucked balls didn liked it hope people find my review helpful unlike others didn sugar coated my words just wrote what was true1.0\tliked that the movie is dark and contains drama pattinson bruce wayne is weak in this movie compared to other batman movies as batman think he is good in this movie think the main villain riddler was very good didn like the catwoman scenes very much overall the movie was good but it wasn at the level of nolan batmans still think the best batman movie is undoubtedly the dark knight the batman 100.0\twent into the movie blind and was still disappointed at what they done to batman pattinson cannot carry either batman or bruce wayne as batman he fails at being intimidating and fails at being detective who asked for moody emo version of bruce wayne overall the movie dragged on way too long much of which is scenes that linger way longer than needed and too many plots going on the riddler was not recognizeable wouldn put that on the actor as if he would have been new villain could have seen it work out but bi polar little twitter warrior incarnate isn what the riddler is about the only highlights of this movie is colin farrell as the penguin who did good job as the penguin and jeffrey wright was just spot on as james gordon but neither can safe this absolute mess of movie0.0\twas rather disappointed with this am fan of rp but sadly his bruce wayne portrayal was below average don feel like he captured the character in the super hero way as batman he was better but still not up to par the story line was okay dragged out little which is never really bad thing as long as it picks up which think it did some action scenes were really good but overall looked like college students version fan fiction with the directing and effects upset to not see many batman gadgets as well this felt more like vigilante teenager that happens to have cool car was expecting more1.0\tbetween the score cinematic style pacing and incredible acting this was hands down the best batman yet don watch the trailer or read detailed reviews just watch it and thank me through the ether1.0\tloved it robert did fab job didn expect him to be that good movie is pretty engaging and just loved every bit of it definitely must watch1.0\tthe batman is great movie as simple as that the major merit of the film is the world built and the atmosphere that are like taken straight out of comic book this is thanks to superb direction there are like four or five scenes that are already printed in my mind and fantastic score that always follows perfectly the scenes also the performances are great and they contribute in making all the characters super interesting and want to see them again in future products the only thing that prevents this movie to ascend into greatness is the plot it doesn have anything wrong but it only linear and simple it is presented in complicate way but in the end is simple but without any huge problem also the motivations of the villain were not that interesting to me and felt bit flat and maybe the final part was little too long but this atmosphere and this new different interpretation of batman it more detective and more scary than in previous movies are outstanding and the simple plot doesn ruin anything really liked this one very good one1.0\twhile am huge batman fan was not excited for this movie as it been done before or has it this movie skips the origin story but doesn skimp on the history or gotham or how any the characters got to there present state it gritty it dark it fun the first hour wasn so sure about this take but after that the story kicks into high gear and it was so fun to watch1.0\trobert pattinson is very good batman great introvert version of bruce wayne the movie is poorly written in every super hero movie there should be villain that has good on screen time one that makes you feel that he has an idea and has background story but in this batman movie there was no villain just random corrupted people and random killer with no real motive reminded me of for vendetta minus the cool poetry spoiler alert joker wise in the next batman movie they will make another disaster of joker like what happened with jared letto all over again since they casted nobody while everyone was waiting for juaqin phoenix joker and they almost wanted us to be excited for that anyway if were you save my money and wait for pirated leak to watch this film1.0\tdetective batman at it finest initially thought the three hour run time ran the risk of being too long but that wasn the case it flew by the third act which was my concern after reading some critic reviews ahead of the film didn disappoint me thought the ending was well executed and moved away from the typical superhero film conclusion the cinematography in this film was amazing the plot was very well executed however there were few flaws as mentioned above had no issue with the run time however understand those who are critical of it at times it felt like there was pacing issue this film won be for everyone it arguably the darkest batman film yet and moves away from the usual comic book film pattinson does decent job playing role which is closest to that of edward cullen who he played in twilight whilst trying to move away from his association with those films and think he can do that now overall really enjoyed the film and highly recommend this the comparison with the dark knight however are highly reactionary1.0\tdifferent approach from everything we already saw from the batman stories the cinematography and soundtrack were impeccable and described the right tone for the movie in my opinion the setting of this movie is also another amazing part of the story gotham has dirty and caotic appeal to its identity the photography is also another amazing part of the movie which gives us many theatrical scenes consequently the casting of this movie was decisive and important characters from batman arc were faithful to the story the characters of falcone great surprise by the way penguin and even the riddler were good enough for the perks of the movie however the most impactful aspect within characters was the relationship between jim gordon the the batman it was well established and perfectly cordinated by both actors also the interaction between batman and cat woman was pretty interesting and handled well by the actors and the director himself overall the batman is great movie and creates new type of interpretation of the fears and traumas in bruce wayne life it is precisely focused on the wayne legacy within gotham and creates the tension for new stories and more movies to come1.0\tthis movies represents what batman should be vengenace and detective with very dark side thumbs up to matt reeves all the actors have played their role perfectly finalyy worthy movie which can be compared to nolan movies1.0\tas heard on christopher nolan interview the batman character thrives on reinterpretation and the most recent one does it justice can deny nolan trilogy and his take on the masked vigilante are on my top favorite movies of all time so can say with certainty that was very hesitant in believing this movie could even compare to his approach and know comparisons shouldn be made in the first place since these are different takes on the character but am happy to say that highly enjoyed and was pleasantly surprised this new version and its dark and grim environment before digging into more details want to start by saying that the soundtrack puts the movie in whole other level its one of those flicks where it makes so much of difference and dictates the entire mood and atmosphere of the story the plot is very engaging we see more faithful take on the comics with the detective aspect of the batman being more highlighted here also we see more dark and damaged bruce wayne while the movie explores in deeper fashion the internal struggle of the individual it odd because in some ways this movie is less realistic than the dark knight trilogy with more super hero like moments however its set in more realistic environment where both hero and villains are depicted in very humane way allowing the audience to connect with these characters would say that some moments of the story are bit predictable and while pattinson does an amazing job as batman wasn sold on his take on bruce wayne but can get that the dull and numb approach resonates with the psychology of this specific batman version on the acting department as mentioned believe robert did amazing as the batman and zoe is the best catwoman so far on the big screen of course the special mention goes to paul dano who steals the show with the amazing and terrifying performance as the riddler it long movie but never felt it was over extending the pace feels right for the whole story to unfold and since there are lot of important characters from the comics within one movie think the story had natural flow to it don know if sequels are coming up but they set the bar high without doubt still favor nolan trilogy personally but matt reeves did amazing it surpassed my expectations1.0\there the 4k lowedown on the batman pg 13 2022 theater genre fantasy comic my score cast 10 acting plot 10 ending story 10 imagine pace 10 comic 10 funny when the riddler sadistic serial killer begins murdering key political figures in gotham batman is forced to investigate the city hidden corruption and question his family involvement our scars can destroy us even after the physical wounds have healed right down to the narration this was the closest to the dark horse comics version of batman that have seen with equal parts christian bale and heath ledger robert pattinson appeared very damaged as the caped crusader zoe kravitz brought back the eartha kitt version of catwoman for me expected it to be dark so there was very little humor what didn expect was the movie being hours long it dragged lot in the middle this is definitely worth seeing on the big screen just be ready for marathon1.0\tit hard to watch movie like this and review it irrespective of the other movies mean what can this movie do that the others happened and yet was wrong despite having some pretty substantial flaws with the movie loved it kinda so let dive in the characters are great here some of the best versions of this character pattinson may be my favourite batman so far and really like how distant his character is kravitz is great catwoman and farrell is great penguin ll always have preference for the burton versions but these characters are pretty much entirely different jeffrey wright may be my favourite gordon though if being honest don find that an especially difficult role to fill the riddler is awesome and one of the best on screen villains to date could ve used more of him but he was the first villain who thought was genuinely terrifying alfred is good although there isn much of andy serkis if you re expecting him another surprise character is played by john turturro who thought was really great and probably the best portrayal of this character that brings me to the style of this movie all the movies before this have been very different and it was concern of mine that these would be too much like the nolan ones but there distinct noir influence here that makes this one distinct the city is grimy and always raining but not in the sort of over the top burton landscape of the first two the action is easily the best part which ve always thought has been lacking in these movies in general batman feels raw and brutal there no sense that this guy is superhero he really in there giving his all the sound design is great and very intense was worried about the coloring going into the film but looking on nice cinema screen it looked really good and the music really delivers it hard to imagine how anyone would possibly expect to match the previous scores but feel like this one is pretty great and then we get into the story which is my biggest weakness the overall structure of this movie is divided into three acts would say very long first act second act and third act the first act is amazing and easily what kept me going it was an easy 10 10 characters are introduced with good development there lot of good detective scenes and it overall just enthralling and then to keep it spoiler free character begins to stop appearing and side plot pops up that honestly wasn handled well at all this development leads into comic book storyline that honestly wasn handled very well it could have been but thought the movie ultimately didn commit to what the necessity of that plot required you ll definitely figure it out once you watch it that isn to say its bad but it is much less engaging then the interesting story the film sets up and then when they return to the main story the movie is more interesting but it overall felt pointless the third act is kinda hampered by this but it overall really good and then they kinda ruin certain character by introducing someone else there was also few too many times thought that the riddler echoed ledger joker not in the performance there were just too many scenes were was like hey didn they already do this it shame with the story because think the fundamentals are there and would even be able to forgive it if this movie had lesser story but the fact that the overarching story is good and then it just looses its footing makes the drop even more of an issue which will say is also positive if you enjoy the middle plot and some of the flaws mentioned you might love this movie was honestly feeling 10 10 but had to detract bit for some of the negatives definitely worth seeing though1.0\tlet me start of by saying really enjoyed this flick with the fact that this is dark and dirty gotham city we don get to see much difference between bruce wayne and batman in the past bruce was the positive happier side of the two and batman was the more cynical this batman universe there is no room for any happiness just crime fighting to try to make it better it also dives into batman being detective we see this in other batman movies universes but this was big part of the plot batman is also not mythical creature that just disappears when he wants mean in the end he is just normal guy with lot of money and really wants to just make gotham better safer place the question he asks himself though is he actually making difference1.0\twithout truly nitpicking liked the movie it just too damn long and jim carrey riddler is better riddle me this riddle me that who afraid of the big black bat1.0\thuge batman fan and was very skeptical about seeing this because it was robert pattinson and couldn see him as playing batman this movie was beyond great and zoe ohhh my goodness she was just amazing in this movie the entire casting was great0.0\twell went against my better judgement after reading the negative reviews and gave this movie try how anyone can rate this movie good is beyond me all the negative reviews are correct this movie is so freaking boring its easily an hour too long rob pattinson is terrible as batman stick to vampires dude everything knew batman to be was destroyed in this woke movie the only good thing ll say is they managed good story line but it was serious snooze fest with minimal action no way ll ever watch the sequel had to come home and watch the dark knight just to feel better about my favorite super hero sorry christian bale and heath ledger will always be the best batman and joker on the silver screen1.0\tam more of marvel fan but have to say this movie made me have an appreciation for batman robert pattinson did so well and the fact that the movie was also one big mystery definitely made me love it although it is by default as have not seen any of the others this is my favourite batman movie1.0\tnot single scene during these hours fail to amaze me the visuals the music the perfect portrayal of the characters from every actor actress in this movie is perfection after 10 minutes knew this was going to be great but every scene thereafter continued to get better and better never thought christian bale batman could be topped but give pattinson triology in this style and don think there will even be question about which triology is the better amazing work1.0\tloved the batman again and again one word comes to be to describe it extraordinary it may seem familiar but it unlike anything you ve seen before and in the days of superhero movies that something really freaking1.0\tthe batman was incredibly crafted movie it had all the elements it need to become an masterpiece greatness on same level as the dark knight never felt that the movie is lengthy as it keeps you interested the whole time thanks to mattreeves1.0\tone of my favorite films this year presenting stunning cinematography as one of the main strengths of this film the story is so complex and amazing the action and detective scenes are so balanced and impartial brutal action scenes and deductions that blow my mind even though there are action scenes for lovers of the mystery genre this is one of the recommended choices1.0\twas another batman necessary maybe and maybe not regardless this was unique direction to take the beloved comic book hero coming in at lengthy three hours the movie was half an hour too long little more editing was needed to take off the scenes that dragged the first hour and half was exciting and enjoyable to watch the city the corruption the despair all very effective the cinematography was brilliant the score was subtle when it needed to be and in your face just at the right moments the story is compelling and the noire worked well acting was mostly fine the riddler was slightly disappointing paul dano is wonderful actor but it seemed like he was playing character here rather then being one in other terms the riddler was overdone over played like ohhhh crazy psychopath ooooooo overall great addition to the dc discography excited to see what comes next1.0\tfor anybody who is long term batman fan like myself believe you will thoroughly enjoy this movie it has everything the villain roster was used extremely well and set up potential situations for the future of this batman franchise the colour palette that was used in the film really suited the tone there was nothing out of place pattinson did superb job whilst in the cowl this film was most definitely batman comic in motion it truly captured batman at the start of his vigilante career it also didn feel like almost hour movie either time went by so fast which is always good sign look forward to seeing more from this team of actors in the future1.0\tas life long batman fan have longed for someone to do justice to batman as conceived in the wonderful comics christopher nolan the dark knight was the best film so far in my opinion but there were still elements missing and the usual emphasis on gadgetry matt reeves has changed that with film that finally puts the emphasis on batman himself his personality the anguish and rage that drives him and his abilities as detective the gadgets are downplayed and the action sequences are more realistic robert pattinson is surprisingly good as batman who has real vulnerability and whose inner conflict is all too near the surface there is an element of police thriller and mystery about the film which makes it all the more engaging some people might wonder about the length of the film at nearly three hours but one hardly notices the time this is film with solid plot which grips from the first and never lets go there is also an astonishing performance from colin farrell as the penguin batman lives and can wait for the sequel1.0\tdc fans are gonna love this movie so comic accurate guessing bruce wayne is at his starting stages of being the batman and the movie portrays this perfectly this sequel of batman with robert pattinson is great start and hope it stays like this with only batman and his crazy villains in gotham no need for superman no need for justice league this is the batman we need acting was amazing direction was amazing graphics was amazing although the movie could have been shortened doesn bother the audience too much when you get good content1.0\tthe batman is movie that is dark and undeniably beautiful the hours was totally worth it it really is one of the greatest movie ever watch in the theater1.0\tthis is another title worth going to the cinema for and ve heard lot of good things about this movie robert pattinson is an interesting choice for the hero know him from the twilight series among others many well known faces act in this movie even colin farrell as the penguin which is not recognizable at first glance the movie is very dark which fits batman movies the story on the other hand is very well told and the riddler plays an important role as villain the movie has something of detective movie in it because the riddler poses riddles aimed at batman you never know what going to happen next and it exciting also worth mentioning is catwoman with whom batman develops strange relationship to come to the conclusion would like to say that really liked the movie and that my cinema experience was worth it only the best for this movie from me1.0\tthe batman was pretty solid film and just as good as the nolan trilogy there was the potential for this film to just copy the nolan trilogy but it definitely got it own identity apart from it it has decent plot more murder mystery style and the riddler was fantastic truly terrifying villain it properly reimagined and it completely works the cinematography of this film was truly outstanding the majority of the shots were simply work of art the set design was outstanding instead of having generic new york style city gotham completely has its own identity it dark it gritty it dirty and most importantly it feels grounded it creates its own world which feels intriguing and necessary to explore especially during the night club scene which felt so real that it was completely immersive the film could be criticised for having slightly long run time for hours it does sometimes feel bit long especially the long action sequences however there is lot of storytelling to make up for it very good film and just as good as batman begins definitely one to recommend1.0\tcame into this movie with high expectations they exceeded after watching this movie to start the dark and depressing tone of gotham really stands out in this iteration of the batman series it matches the dark and gloomy theme really showing city that is on its last legs to start with the riddler paul danos potrayl of the ridder is up there for me he has such an sadistic tone of voice while putting on an eerily expression essentially he like darker version of batman he lurks in the shadows hidden and waiting for his target and it shows he has livestreams great clues it really shows of the zodiac inspired vibes the other characters such as penguin and catwomen were good would of liked to see penguin in more scenes but colin farrels version was good catwoman was good not much to say about her the movie was quite cliche at some points and it was easy to guess what was going to happen the music was fire really was vibe pattinson batman is probably one of my favourites was little worried before watching it but love him he an more unhinged batman his detective story was great alfred was great still think gothams alfred was better but this one was extremely great overall thought it was great soft reboot of the franchise and excited for spin offs and sequels1.0\tpattinson is by far my favorite batman such real and deep take on the character zoe had great chemistry with robert and presented well developed female character which unfortunately don see too often came in with very high expectations and this met them for sure wonderful movie definitely in my top of all time1.0\tthis batman is up there with the dark knight wish rob would have been cast to play batman in justice league and batman vs superman ben affleck wasn it hope rob continues as batman like christian bale val kilmer and michael keaton1.0\tthis movie is hands down awesome so much mystery and there is feeling of desolation and doom the dark themes are so powerful and truly leave the viewer filled with terror and awe simultaneously nevertheless there is only one thing wish the filmmakers did they should have made it rated they could add so much more violence which in my opinion would have made it better and they could have cursed more both would add further depth of grime and filth that show the true horrors of gotham on side note the fact that they made the world of gotham feel so dirty without the rated rating is very impressive and should be praised but simply wish they went all out feel they held back little bit1.0\tthis is amazing film for dc fans and boring hours for common viewer it was very dark at my cinema and hard to see what happens but think this is unusual problem for me1.0\tthis movie is unlike any other it is dark bold real the music dives you much deeper into what the story is unfolding we get to see more human side of the batman love everything about this film0.0\tmovie was total waste of time there was lot of silent pauses needles scenes that seemed to go on for ever nodded off twice was so angry with this waste of movie felt like walking out half way don know how made it to the end christopher nolan was the daddy this is just load of garbage don waste three hours of your life watching dark what seemed to be never ending rainy film so angry wasted my time1.0\twill admit cringed bit at the thought of pattison as batman but it gets the bad taste of affleck out of your mouth and takes us back to the welcoming dark knight glory dano riddler was amazing jeffrey wright as gordon was another great role all around great movie1.0\twhen the trailer fists came out over years ago was super excited but little skeptical because love the christopher nolen films and was worried this remake was gonna be too soon but boy were my doughy wrong was blown out of the water by this film it was gritty dark violent and mysterious loved it it had very noir feel too it which gave it that extra bit of edge loved that it was film focused on batman as he just starting to come into his own still trying to figure out who he is in the world also loved that this film took him back to his roots and made him detective and quick shoutout to zoe cravats as cat woman she did an amazing job robert pattinson as batman was probably the biggest highlight and draw of this film he was made for this role he didn do anything overboard and didn do anything goofy or cartoonish he played it straight and with power also loved that fact that he doesn speak many lines you can just see and feel the emotions and thoughts through his eyes it truest was mesmerizing performance another quick shoutout to the other actors who appeared in this film they all did outstanding jobs and put fresh spin on these classic characters and have to say that the riddler was expertly casted what performance if your having any doubts of fear it won live up to expectations ignore those feelings and go see the movie it is slow burn but it worth it in the end it film that must be seen on the big screen0.0\tmovie dragged on from the very beginning if you thought zack synder films were slow you ll be in he11 trying to make it through this could hardly stay awake1.0\tthe background music was the goat dcbeaxbfd tggtbbrhrr rhrhrjrhrjrjgegrjtktururi5yyeyktjeulr67458e7 kk smsyntwhrhtwe6e784or6e5twjsnetw4w56362987llrr7eykykekwynnangnfv zcngnzgsgntawt1.0\tthe last few years we have been bombarded with decent good superhero movies this is the one movie that stands on it own two legs and delivers no universe tied no other characters to hype the movie up no promise of future connection just this movie with great story characters and acting the score is amazing it good comeback for michael that did forgettable job with no way home amazing theme for batman1.0\tgive colin farrell an oscar when saw that pattinson will be the new batman was disappinted and expected to be real disaster but boy this movie was brutal the acting the music the plot the dark and rainy atmosphere everything was on point but for me colin farrell absolutely stole the show with his penguin character he was bit similar to de niro in couple of his gangster movies also looked like him bit haha can wait to see the coming movies with pattinson1.0\tif you like the marvel recipe for how to make movie well then you re going to hate this one bright colorful poses humor every 15 minutes lame over the top scene after scene yeah not in the batman this was more of drama than action film it had more in common with suspense movie than superhero movie it reminded me of the joker movie the hours went by fast for me at one point it did drag little but the pacing is really good so got sucked right back in shout out to paul dano his acting was amazing he was so unnerving his delivery of his lines was superb his eyes you could see his anger his pain such good performance everyone else was good too enjoyed the entire cast but riddler stole the show the movie is so well made the dark knight was better movie but the batman was better portrayal of batman they showed his anger his depression and how he is consumed with his parents death and what that would actually look like it comes off as emo batman but that who he would actually be so don mind it if you re that consumed by your past it shows in the present and it did my only complaint is the same one have with every batman film they downgrade batman and have to make him as realistic as possible wish they would make him like he is in the comics in the movie he smart not brilliant he good fighter but not amazing for example his cape is just for show he uses squirrel suit to soar around which yeah is realistic but rather him just use his cape does it make sense with reality no the squirrel suit makes sense but he not realistic he near perfect with ridiculous gadgets and like to see that we re okay with wonder woman reflecting bullets superman being well superman ironman flying around at jet speed shooting pulse cannons thor being god but batman yeah he has to be realistic literally his cape doesn do anything because that not realistic enough for it to have purpose so let give him squirrel suit lol meanwhile every other superhero is so unbelievable but every batman movie they re like how do we show he just man but hes not just man he insanely over the top and wish they portray him as such just one time okay my rant is over go see the movie1.0\tthis movie should be the standard for every superhero movie in the future the performances all around were amazing especially robert pattinson batman from the suit to the voice it is pure perfection also cannot forget about paul dano take on the riddler who is breath taking scary with the movie being nearing three hours in run time it is epic from beginning to end this movie captures every detail perfectly others will complain that it is too dark and gloomy that is what and who batman bruce wayne is 10 10 film get your tickets now1.0\tthe riddler paul dano has recently murdered number of high profile politicians in gotham city with the gotham police department unable to crack the case lt gordon jeffrey wright calls on batman robert pattinson to bring this maniacal killer to justice along the way batman becomes entangled with catwoman zoe kravitz who is seeking vengeance against mob boss carmine falcone john turturo and his henchman the penguin colin farrell while batman digs through the city past he leans on his butler alfred andy serkis to help see how deep corruption runs this film is journey in every sense of the word simple riddle sets off series of events that intertwine and dig deep into the past of gotham director and writer matt reeves along with co writer peter craig craft compelling tale that leaves no stone unturned reeves is meticulous in his direction with meaning behind every shot he has constructed true detective story involving batman it doesn take long to realize that reeves knows exactly what he wants and all of the actors are on board with his vision and when that happens you end up with borderline masterpiece every technical aspect of this film lends itself to the spectacular finished product the cinematography is what pulls you into gotham alongside every character when you combine that with brooding score which slightly resembles john williams imperial march you get dark landscape of gotham once that is layered on top of the seedy production design of gotham city which looks like an early 1970 new york with futuristic element you have recipe for gorgeous film there is such great blend of visual effects that you have to actively seek out the effects which is testament of the great work done and lastly the incredible stunt coordinating and choreography all of the hand to hand combat is hard hitting and grounded leaving batman vulnerable and giving him realistic human quality there is also an incredible car chase sequence that fires on all cylinders when you have batman film your lead has to portray the caped crusader and his real life persona bruce wayne robert pattinson channels his inner batman and portrays gritty detective still trying to get his footing while donning the cowl pattinson fully transcends into the bat he does however leave little to be desired while portraying bruce wayne this is not the eccentric billionaire wayne who flashes his money this is hermit wayne still young in adulthood perhaps in the future we can look back at this portrayal as building block for what is to come the rest of the cast were equally on top of their game jeffrey wright plays the trusting gordon who goes against the grain and partners up with batman the two play good cop and bad cop that leans into the noir aspect of this film paul dano is sadistic as riddler behind mask for majority of the runtime he lets his voice and body language pull you into the darkness zoe kravitz brings an elegance to her role moving around the screen with the grace of cat the chemistry between batman and catwoman is palpable they both want the same thing but want to go about it in different ways john turturro has the dramatic acting chops to portray ruthless fearless crime lord while his time on screen is limited andy serkis plays alfred as stern father figure who has no trouble telling young bruce the way things are finally colin farrell is masterful in his portrayal of the penguin he was lost in that role there were times when forgot it was colin farrell he was the standout performance in my opinion when you get to the flaws in this film you re getting to preference felt like knocking 20 minutes off the three hour runtime would have been beneficial once the third act hit reeves may have let up on the gas leaving you wishing it would have kept the pace of the second act don take that as knock on the third act it was phenomenal but some tightening up would have helped pattinson as bruce wayne was little bit of downer but this is different bruce than we are accustomed to there is nothing more to say other than that this film is close to masterpiece all of the characters relationships setups style and atmosphere play hand in this opening and closing voiceovers bring you into the mind of batman and everything in between lets you experience the journey he is on and what he must do to become the hero that gotham needs matt reeves has created batman film that will stand the test of time by not only being great batman film but masterstroke in filmmaking1.0\tit is everything promised my matt reeves dark gritty and noir though it was hour movie but it didn feel that long the only problem with this movie was limited roles of bruce wayne and alfred its stupid to compare it directly with nolan dark knight both are unique in their own way this movie showed unexplored side of batman robert pattinson and zoe kravitz played their role to the perfection loved it looking forward for trilogy here1.0\tas we know batman is dark character this went to the depth with batman as behavioral wise and detective wise this batman explains him mentally and show his emotional side robert patterson did it cat women did amazing riddler penguin and etc the whole cast did it maybe all should read the comic books before judging why it dark and etc go watch it pay attention1.0\tlook big fan of the batman franchise always have been but when look back on some of the earlier versions honestly can say that this one compares favourably it good without being great it sticks with the same themes moribund anti hero deeply psychotic criminal gothic dark corrupt city overrun by broad spectrum of criminals ranging from petty thieves to open gang land warfare but the storyline in this iteration seems needlessly complex at times at nearly hours it also runs for about 45 minutes longer than it needed to clue see it in comfortable or premium cinema with large bucket of popcorn overall worth the time to watch and good fun1.0\tpattinson is amazing as batman like everyone had my doubts he could be compelling batman and was wrong he and zoe kravitz are perfectly cast hell the whole movie is perfectly cast colin farell couldn believe it was you as penguin beautifully shot and the music was great it was gritty without being gratuitously gory seriously the best movie ve seen in so long worth every minute of screen time can wait for the sequel1.0\tthis is the batman movie ve been waiting for this is literally the best thing have ever seen pattinson was perfect for this role and exceeded all my expectations thank you matt reeves1.0\tmatt reeve the batman 2022 this movie runtime is 2hrs 56mins but it does not bore you even for one second there is so much going on in this movie that it keeps you engaged in the film in every scene this is whole new take on the gotham caped crusader dark knight this new batman is ground to earth and not yet full gadgety and technologically advanced which gives this movie true and realistic touch which fans loved the most for this first movie suggestion do watch it in theatre screens with dolby atmos you will enjoy the movie alottt more my score 101.0\thave seen lot of batman movies over the years and each characters and stories have always brought their own vibe with them have to admit that don follow comic books and hence don generally do the comic book accuracy comparisons that most people make with the superhero movies have loved the bale nolan combination and don hate affleck portrayal either but boy didn see this batman coming matt reeves takes you to whole new universe within 180 minutes with the new batman it is gritty it is dark literally and figuratively and it is exceptionally shot matt reeves batman focuses primarily on telling the story of gotham unlike many other batman movies before it is almost as if the audience sees gotham through the eyes of batman once again literally and figuratively while batman partners up with commissioner gordon to solve the city corruption and crime he has to face more nuanced threat from the riddler the batman in this movie is not pretty or hunky but he is very intelligent and has great detective skills he is troubled individual and matt reeves puts no effort on making him look pretty which gives us whole new experience the story is much more complicated than just the protagonist vs the antagonist and it explores batman character depth was just little bit unconvinced with the chaotic climax but it does serve bigger purpose the action scenes are more raw and realistic and there are no eye pleasing attempts the movie predominantly runs on black and red theme just like the title card and it is quite sight robert pattinson definitely has to take all the praise for his portrayal of very unique batman he is pretty much batman throughout the movie and there are barely any attempts of exploring wayne within him but we still have to see how he will fit in the justice league universe in case there is an expansion with pattinson in plan one of the highlights of the movie is commissioner gordon and batman chemistry and jeffry wright plays key part executing it really well zoe kravitz as catwoman is more than eye pleasing and her character development has been done well while colin farrell doesn have much to do as the penguin he really executes the character and accent well he almost makes you feel like you are watching de nero john turturro has played very smooth version of falcone paul dano as the riddler primarily dominates with his voice the batman 2022 is more not just superhero movie but an intense crime detective drama make sure to watch it in very good imax screen as most of the movie is dark but beautifully dark1.0\tit was awesome just wanna say the best batman ever robbert pattinson nailed it had goosebumps while watching the movie in the movie you ll introduce yourself with perfect batman1.0\tused to tell people that ve never watched the dark knight rises because in my mind could never remember seeing the movie now after watching the batman realized that do remember seeing the dark knight rises it was just as boring and unmemorable as this one0.0\thours too long poor acting even worse plot you won get this hours of your life back trust me other than my son the rest of the family scored it1.0\tstarts slow and subtle and then picks up pace as it progresses focus remains on villains and the batman which is great to stay focued on main characters excellent score and action sequences has more of the comic feel which might let you think is the print ok but that how it is ending could have been better with more climax action sequence so the viewers could have had more closure as most fans will compare it with dark night but this is totally new approach amd concept so need to compare and watch it with open mind thanks1.0\tif you re looking for explosions fast paced antics and pure adrenaline with side of humor this movie is not for you some people say this is mystery film but it is not while mystery is involved this movie is for people looking for noir esque thriller focused on self discovery and understanding with side of some badass visuals and fight choreography1.0\twell it kinda feel little bored at the middle of the movie cause the detective clues and whatnot but overall good casting scoring cinematic all good highly recommended this movie its absolutely cinema even my gals who liked marvel says this movie is 10 101.0\tthe batman is outstanding in every way the camera work the editing the director the only thing that could be criticized is the duration it could have been shortened by good 15 minutes without sacrificing quality but even so every minute is pleasure provided you have comfortable seat in the cinema and this is definitely movie you have to see in the theater the sound editing and score are fantastic the film shows batman as detective and the story develops slowly but is extremely complex also find the confrontation of the hero and the villain brilliant found the moment when batman realizes that the line between heroism and madness is very narrow outstanding however you should keep in mind that this is not pure action movie but dark detective story into the abysses of humanity it is not colorful comic adventure but dark tale1.0\tall the hate this film has had is wrong this is the perfect batman movie it is so accurate to the dark twisted vibe that the comic books pattison plays beautifully twisted and broken batman and is perfect for the role hope there are many more to come1.0\tfantastic movie with great cinematography and storyline one of the best comicbook movie every single character played fantastic role best live action batman1.0\tstoryline acting cinematography sound and score all came together to make this almost hour movie seem short robert pattinson is the dark knight his performance was outstanding paul dano was that brilliant broken character like he was in prisoners this movie is must see0.0\twas bored enough to buy ticket to watch this movie and have to say it one of the worst batman flicks recently created ben affleck was so much better in his version of batman im surprised there hasn been ton of disgruntled viewers like the previous batman vs superman enjoyed vs way more im just not feeling this new guy as the batman wouldn recommend anyone paying to see it wait to see it free when it appears on amc or tbs1.0\talways love any batman movie but this is just refreshing new setting new detective storyline different approach to characters by the actors with the same characters it feels diiferent the horror game was on point also with the dark creature looming the music by michael giachino is always amazing my vote is have spoken0.0\tlet us start with robert pattinson he does try to convince as the batman as best as he can given the lacking script rather poor overall presentation in the line of bumpy batman franchise storyline lacking cohesion to previous incarnations who knows where this fits in character development we are presented with randomness in the timeline overall one is left to ponder the what when and where this all is supposed to make sense we are left to wonder what this installment represents in the saga it is unfortunately large budget rendition that feels very displaced and has not foundation to stand on its own1.0\twas excited ever since this was announced couple of years ago initially going in thought may of overhyped it but oh boy was wrong this movie is amazing the whole mood of the film was outstanding the whole dark atmosphere of the movie was hit to perfection the cinematography in this film was so thought out and it truly made me smile seeing some of the scenes one thay really stood out to me is towards the end where batman had blue and red police lights reflecting off his face to me this was absolutely phenomenal the soundtrack gave me goosebumps from the chilling batman music to the nirvana cover which fits the movie unbelievably well the person who really stole the show for me was the riddler whenever riddler was on the screen was on edge thinking what he would do next to shock the audience few problems had with this movie though is that at one point things felt rushed for example not to give any spoilers but something occurs in the movie which could of been real change to how the movie played out but it was instantly shut down which thought was pretty lazy but it didn really stop me from liking the movie anyless anyways cannot stop thinking about this movie and urge you to watch this movie this is my first review and is probably written awfully but hope did ok with expressing how good this movie is1.0\tif you are expecting an action filled dark knight movie serial repeat you will be very dissappointed if you expecting dark but fun tim burton movie serial repeat you will be very dissappointed the batman stands on it own two feet with version that is more about building background story alike the tv series gotham did but with the art film style plot speed and twists that joker delivered more recently my advise is go and see the movie expecting something fresh and you will enjoy on side note so nice to see riddler return to big screen and proper interpretation of penguin nearly all the underground gang is portrayed decently which as said earlier builds the gotham story0.0\tabout the only thing can say good about this movie is that robert pattinson wasn terrible as batman but was poor excuse for bruce wayne the few and far between action scenes seemed like battle between the cinematography and the music to see which could be more annoying too dark to see what going on ridiculous musical crescendos for no reason at all way too long huge batman fan but honestly couldn wait for it to be over and contemplated leaving before the end1.0\tto be fair biased when it comes to batman he my favorite superhero and has been since was years old watching adam west play him on tv the trailers managed to set high expectations but caused me to fear that we re seeing the best parts of the film too obviously there lot of hype surrounding the movie and concerns that it might be overblown because studio wants to earn it money back then on the other side you have the fanboys who love their superhero movies and will rate them high even though it piece of trash fanboy not even going to apologise for publicly admitting it and batman is my favorite superhero ll even admit that can make good argument in support of any batman movie but there comes time when you just need to open the door and invite someone to try it out themselves the movie is hours long but it doesn feel like it at all and that about the highest praise can provide do have some minor issues with the story they could have ended the movie sooner than they did and it felt like the final act was little contrived but it didn feel forced or that it didn add to the plot in any way just didn think it matched the overall tone of the movie their pick for catwoman wasn my favorite not saying that didn like her saying that she didn own the role margot robbie owns the harley quinn role don think anyone could do it better linda carter owns the wonder woman role zoe kravitz fell short of that kind of casting choice but can emphasize this enough she not bad at all and even admit that there some great chemistry between her and batman but this could be because ve got mixed feelings of how she portrayed in the movie not huge fan of this portrayal of alfred either ve always seen him as the traditional butler something you would see watching downton abbey this seems to be influenced by gotham or even joker but these are minor issues ve got and minor they are riddler makes great batman adversary here and will be compared to the dark knight version of joker in many aspects complete departure from classic versions but well grounded in realism and hope to see him make another return maybe even influence other material he used in1.0\treally love this movie robert pattinson is the best batman in the movies the elements of the arkhan games are so good mater piece of cinema is my new favorite batman movie and think that robert pattinson need more recognition of awards0.0\tif there was ever movie that benefited from marketing campaign and pre release hype this is the one can remember time when wanted movie to end so badly from beginning to end was subjected to poor acting poor directing poor cinematography and poor editing if you enjoy spending three full hours watching dark overly dramatic sloth like movie then this is your pick by the time it was over was just happy to have scene where everyone was in focus and wasn looking through hazy rainy or otherwise obscured lens can even describe how bad the acting was and having an emo batman was just painful to watch as was the quasi romantic scenes with catwoman who went nowhere as character bottom line hours of your life you re going to want back1.0\twhy anyone was thinking that this new version of batman would follow the same formula as the previous trilogy did is laughable things change this new reboot was fantastic it isn anything like the mind numbing garbage that marvel have been spewing out lately this new batman movie has some bite to it if you understand anything at all about basic human psychology then you should enjoy this it goes much deeper into the mind of bruce wayne than any of its predecessors an idea that should have been realised years ago matt reeves has achieved something special here it just too bad that some people don have the iq to see it doubt they even watched the whole movie and missed the gripping ending1.0\tbatman is poet the introduction of batman is perfectly executed he is scary mysterious and powerful the visuals complemented by pattinson narration are phenomenal some of the best scenes featured narration robert pattinson is phenomenal actor and great batman pattinson interpretation of the caped crusader is very different from previous iterations but that isn necessarily bad thing one of the best parts about batman is bruce wayne pattinson bruce wayne barely makes any public appearances and he doesn act as the funny playboy we ve come to know he is truer to himself and doesn put up the bruce wayne charade but it clearly different take on batman which is fine and it works very well fighting choreography was never nolan finest quality the batman does much better job the fight scenes are exquisite but the warehouse scene in batman superman dawn of justice is probably still superior it almost an impossible task to produce better fight scene but the batman comes close pattinson masked vigilante is not as experienced as affleck and it shows he is more vulnerable and his tech is not as advanced this does however make for great grounded action and storytelling pattinson batmobile looks diy but it awesome it almost impossible to not mention the score while discussing batman movie michael giacchino does good job but his score doesn hit as hard as previous scores more specifically hans zimmer score greater score would make some of the scenes more rewarding some scenes are visually breathtaking and choreographed masterfully but they are not as rewarding as they should1.0\tthis movie is lot to take in the plot has many layers and the movie has lot of great easter eggs for the comic fans and this makes the movie fun for repeat viewings the performances are top notch all around have no issues with anyone in the cast robert pattinson not only gives good performance as batman but his costume is also my favorite out of all the batman movies so far it all about that jawline seriously though he looks amazing in the batman suit the movie is dark and rainy and beautiful gotham has never looked so good the look and feel of the film is right out of comic book matt reeves definitely outdid himself in the cinematography department was very happy with the movie and am really looking forward to the sequel hopefully sequels the only problem have with this movie is the riddlers final act throughout the entire movie the riddler has very specific plan going after specific people for reasons that are very clear his final act doesn follow that same plan it kind of felt like matt reeves forgot they had to have big finale since it still comic book movie and said let just do this even though it doesn quite fit into the rest of riddlers story still enjoyed it and it didn ruin the movie for me just wish the same thought went into riddlers finale that went into the rest of his story1.0\toverall this is definetly worth your time the only thing people hate about this film is that it dark gritty and almost humorless so if these are the things you want in batman film go watch marvel film this film lives up to the hype and is an epic gritty and thrilling movie witch will keep you on the edge of your seat this is batman movie maybe even the greatest1.0\tnot the batman you ll expect to see which in way good thing that they didn try to follow any other batman characters prior to this one they introduced political correctness here and there in bits and pieces with some lines which felt unnecessary to the plot to me batman was mostly driven by being bruce wayne on this one which is unlike batman the difference between batman and bruce wayne wasn distinguishable except the costume will ferrel was great lacked the backstory of characters big time felt its good build up for the following batman movies1.0\tamazing movie the best batman loved the photografy and mixed sounds1.0\tve been huge batman fan for most of my life and this is without question my favorite batman movie period can wait to watch it again thank you matt reeves robert pattinson1.0\tthink it was dream for batman fan like me but know some people may not like it because it different from any other batman movie we ever had hope everyone gives it fair chance im still impressed by some of the shots loved it1.0\tleft the cinema amazed happy and wanting to see much more was even sad when it ended didn find any defects the photography camera games and soundtrack are breathtaking congratulations to the entire team robert zoe and paul delivered lot this charade and this batman are epic and the best in my opinion tomorrow will review again to enjoy it more calmly1.0\tve been waiting long time to see the dark knight detective done cinematically and it did not disappoint almost felt like an indie film as it opens beautifully shot with thumping soundtrack at times and great sound design batman is genuinely scary when he appears and when the muscle car makes its entrance you will be transfixed very atmospheric with touch of seven to it and pattison does great job in role no one would have seen him do probably the closest have seen the character done to the comics and reminiscent of scott snyder comic run everyone involved plays their part really well and it is real gritty caped crime fighter we see an awesome new take on long running fan favourite0.0\tthe emo moody batman is more melodrama than drama batman with his inner monologue reminds me of rorschach in watchmen than any version of batman recognise the sets are dark and gothic bit reminiscent of tim burton but not as interesting just sort of annoying like want to adjust my television did not see it in theater am not sure why this film were made am not sure who conceptualised it or why just know it was disappointing and tedious and frankly imagine many millennials will have never seen the nolan batman let alone tim burton say that because in conversation the other day young man told me how he liked bladerunner 2049 and didn even realise there was an original film he did the same with when mentioned that dune was series of books and that there had been david lynch first film no criticism just pointing out to lot of audience this is th only batman so there would be no comparison and there should be0.0\tgot full hours of sleep the night before saw this movie and had cups of coffee caffeinated diet coke before walking into the theater still managed to fall asleep during this snooze fest all of the dialogue was monotoned and long winded the few action sequences managed to stay awake for weren particularly inventive or new the movie was entirely too long and resulted in an extremely anticlimactic ending none of the performances were particularly noteworthy either if the movie is on streaming somewhere soon fine give it watch but say save your money and don go to the theater1.0\tthe most pleasing aspect of this iteration of the famous comic character is think director matt reeves provides story that focuses on the best qualities of the batman the detective it not theme that has been succinctly explored on screen before with this character which think will please any type of cinema goer when they watch this loved the blend of genres that the narrative uses the horror and crime tropes both working hand in hand to delightful effect as the films noir ish atmosphere had such an immersive impact on my experience watching it se7en was film that was definitely referred too during production because the similarities were so apparent the noir elements of the film were my favourites worked so well however the outstanding positive from the film was greg fraser cinematography simply beautiful art the intimate close ups the pristine landscape of gotham and the gorgeous colour palette all shot with fraser expertise performances were all to great standard pattison portrayal suited this film and its theme really well his voice persona was typical of the character but love to see his batman again zoe kravitz was great catwoman paul dano was typically excellent as the riddler and colin farrell was amazing as the penguin such an underrated actor an excellent film that excelled in many aspects can wait too see more while it might not be anywhere near the dark knight it still provides high levels of entertainment that left me wanting more1.0\tand that said this is really well made but prefer the dark knight trilogy and especially batman begins there are lot of positives though the acting is sensational zoe kravitz is great so is pattinson farrell can believe it him it really strong performances overall and the cinematography is right up there it great to watch these things deserve higher rating however enjoy that it different take on well known character but for my liking it just too dark to be completely enjoyable at least for its genre it probably sounds silly but to me dc and marvel are at its best when the stories are little bit cartoonish this story reminds me more about se7en than dc which just means there are other movies in the batman franchise that have enjoyed more there is no doubt though that this will have sequels given its success and will definitely watch them it still that good1.0\twhen first saw that this film runtime is going to be hours was kinda skeptical was unsure if they are going to be able to keep it well paced and was afraid that it will eventually become boring or that the plot will start to get interesting at the end oh boy was wrong this movie manages to hook you in from it first scene which feels like it from horror movie this is more of crime detective thriller than superhero action extravaganza but it really fast paced and there always something going on with nice action as well the sound in the cinema was freaking amazing the cinematography and the colours of gotham were fantastic robert pattinson was amazing as the batman all of the supporting characters were amazing the villain is extremely creepy and scary he will give you chills it also has nice twists watch this even if you are not superhero fan you won be dissapointed1.0\tin my opinion this is the best batman movie of all time before all you dark night fanboys come at me hear me out that dark night is more of joker movie than batman movie in the batman felt everybody shined especially robert pattinson thought he would be terrible as batman but was clearly wrong he shined so much in that role same thing goes for paul dano he really captured that dark version of riddler amazingly the only downside in this movie that it is dark night another thing wanted to mention is the people that are complaining about the race swap in my opinion think you guys are just complaining for the sake of complaining because zoe kravitz delivered the single greatest cat woman performance so yeah in my opinion this is the best batman movie1.0\tthis movie is in my opininion the definition of the world batman the whole film is about him but the other characters are so well desenvolved too get out of the theater paralised1.0\tthe batman is absolutely incredible take fantastic batman detective comics style story add little of seven little of saw then mix them together you will get one hell of batman tale all the pattinson naysayers are gonna change their minds and the entire cast couldn have been better everyone killed it if the hour run time scares you go take piss and watch it all over again right now absolutely beautiful enjoy it in the theater0.0\tthis is hilariously funny it doesn take much to tickle some of you folks anymore pattinson does not incorporate batman at all no way runtime unnecessary almost hours for filler they should have called it the batman and catwoman aka hallie berry woke redemption story and commissioner gordon overacting it loses momentum in the first 45 minutes and doesn regain it this director got high off of his movie too soon to direct it correctly catwoman calls out all you white viewers by saying that all the bad politicians and cops out there are white and privileged labeling and generalizing as most movies do these days the african american female replacement mayor quote unlike the other people of this city isn afraid to stand up from there on out was done the riddler is john doe from the movie seven very obviously transparently derivative and close to embarrassing the same dialogue the same scenes identically the same villain motive the same musical score0.0\tmy absolute least favorite batman movie so slow and drawn out the monotone voice over put me to sleep with the sleepy score kept waiting for the movie to wake me up and it never happened ask for my money back but good sleep is hard to come by1.0\teverything about the first two thirds of matt reeves batman is amazing once the mystery is solved the the last act comes around and felt some steam was lost could gush about the cinematography forever excellent movie1.0\tgreat nice creation absolutely best am big fan of batman from dark knight joker great idea implementation and work on that movie is awesome thanks to director and cast1.0\trobert pattinson was great choice to star as batman and say batman because we see really little of bruce wayne and really enjoyed that loved the plot and the tension built around the riddler perfectly played by paul dano gotham is dark as ever and that makes this movie really great little too long for my taste but worth it in the end0.0\talthough the performances are pretty good the film direction and photography fail not to mention the fact that the script is mess the batman an el rata alada film fails in the introduction of the de characters stumbles in the development of the story does not take advantage of the potential of the actors and finally presents story that does not convince or close the plot line used1.0\tnot gonna say much but it was great one negative is that the pg 13 ratings tames it little too much but still it was really good also the riddler was good in the beginning but he kinda became more bland as the movie went on1.0\tthis movie did not disappoint it was badass and dark like batman movie should be loved the portrayals of each character especially the riddler none of them disappointed the movie was amazing and can wait for the sequel and hopefully get to see the characters come back and grow and transform more into their alter egos1.0\tthoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end not one scene would cut out from the film the runtime didn bother me at all and thought it was going to end later than it did just by reading other reviews what love about this movie is that it feels more realistic than the nolan trilogy which is an incredible feat1.0\twhen saw the trailer was not convinced but read comments stating that it is detective story so gave it try and loved it the story is very interesting and the actors are great not batman for kids though1.0\tll make it clear right now that have not seen the dark knight trilogy so none of what about to say is comparison towards that just simple comics fan that said this movie is amazing first of all it positively gorgeous no one can convince me this is not genuine piece of excellent cinematography cannot stop thinking about the visuals nor can stop listening to the score micheal giacchino strikes again the main concern had going into this movie was that it three hours it does not feel like it at all it an artful blend of what admittedly could have been two different movies but the themes are so closely intertwined that it only makes sense to have them be one all of the casting by the way is positively brilliant there was no one thought wasn right for their role had been skeptical about serkis as alfred but it actually serves to highlight his military background in subtle way which dearly enjoyed kravitz and pattinson stood out to me especially their performances were both spectacular and their chemistry was both brilliantly written and acted now the thing that always makes or breaks batman movie for me is how they actually write bruce and happy to report that this movie excels in its portrayal if you re looking for performance that highlights the juxtaposition between batman the vigilante and bruce wayne the playboy this is not that this is year two batman still wracked with grief and guilt from the deaths of his parents and still endeavouring to figure out how to truly make difference in his city and think for that it perfectly executed incredibly excited to see more from this cast and this crew and especially excited to see more from battinson1.0\tthis was probably the darkest caped crusader installment yet love the serious dramatic element of the dc comic hero over the light hearted comedic marvel characters acting was awesome but there are so many new twists and turns in bruce wayne backstory with each reboot zoe was definitely the best catwoman to date1.0\tfinally my turn to see the newest batman flick and did enjoyed it it has lot of mystery and my subject line says it all intriguing it engaging like your part of gothams lifestyle kudos to patterson as the new batman the reason why gave is that at times it bit dragging got the habit of checking the time from time to time bit orchestrated acting but overall it good movie to see1.0\tbatman is not inspiring he weak he struggling he inexperienced and that how he is whole different take on the world greatest detective and the movie will never expect what is coming it gets deeper and deeper putting you in the edge of the seat it pleasure to mention that just witnessed one of the best gotham city till date and paul dano is the wouldn care about box office or how it going to compete against mcu but these dc guys keeps taking comic book movies to next level seen lots of people compare it to tdk but it incomparable can express with just sheet of paper how great both movies are in their own aspect this movie is solid 10 100.0\tcaught this one on hbo max and to say the least it was disappointment spent most of the movie turning the volume up and down the action scenes were loud and 80 of the dialogue was whisper this time around the acting and story line are on the weak side think the review welcome to the world of the sissy bat sums the movie up really well really wish could say something better about the version of batman0.0\tfrom the trailer had high hopes really looked forward to seeing matt reeves vision for the caped crusader unfortunately was disappointed on every front story pacing acting all terrible with few exceptions colin farrell as oz is revelation andy serkis as alfred is fantastic and in their limited screen times paul dano john turturro crush it as always the bat mobile was awesome too everyone else overacts or appears to be new to acting and with runtime of nearly hours it practically torture this movie could ve told the exact same story in 90 95 minutes easily when they set up sequel near the end didn know whether to be angry or sad or just laugh would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy1.0\tamazing movie dark type and charismatic robert pattinson plays real good batman despite many thought he wasn the one who could deliver it the noir kind of movie amazing plot and chills giving soundtracks and background music makes this one one of the best superhero films throughout good job reeves1.0\tcontent was great roles were accurate but the catwoman thing did make it weird there was no such befitting role of selena the catwoman was there using the role of selena as link to get to the rat dosen calculate her implications in batman life creating romantic highlight apart from the gritty situations was just like adding toppings on rotten pizza1.0\tthis is decent batman film robert pattinson nails the character as bruce wayne and batman the background score and cinematography is good the movie is bit slow could have been better can wait for the sequel1.0\tthe introductory film towards more crime solving batman is certainly fitting for the worlds greatest detective this film introduces gotham as gritty and dark as you hope gotham to be presenting it as almost the protagonist of the story we follow new but establish bruce wayne who is both navigating himself and his vigilante persona often unable to distinguish one from another the cinematography is dramatic and dark in the best way possible every presentation of action and story alike works with dark tones that is so well balanced that it never seemed too monotone while mystery unfolds it draws you in through the desperation of bruce and his established acquaintances the classic batman side characters sets up what we are familiar with alongside fresh presentation of both casting and direction the flaw however resides in the lack of depth within the characters the bat and the cat offers great opportunity to contrast the similarities of two broken and scarred characters and bruce realisation that there needs to be line however it all seemed abit too misplaced and rushed this still does not negate the fact that the dynamic between bruce and selena at times were intimate with dash of danger robert pattinsons portrayal of batman and bruce lacked the dichotomy that is often at the centrepiece of why we cared for batman it also takes away from the charm that was portrayed by bale and his predecessors which while making sense for newfound batman whose still learning his ways made the character lot less relatable and thus less emotionally engaging after establishing new world of gotham it is exciting to see how they ll expand on pattinsons batman through his maturing years as the dark knight through corruption and relationships1.0\thour of just darkness sensuousness gritty of dc batman was just superb and is in the same fray as nolan trilogy and even dark knight the riddler being antagonist was just as perfect as heath ledger believe this story has long way to go the cinematography was also just beautiful and detailed no missing points in between the story pattinson can really grow on you as batman waiting to watch it again1.0\tnew angry batman for new generation robert pattinson new batman has arrived waiting for sequel with joker in next part watch movie for horrifying cenima work1.0\tthe journey from vengeance to hope ensuring he didn lose himself in the transition more than movie it was don know just wanna make sure it 150 or more otherwise this review won see the daylight well paul dano got to showcase his ownself for about mins and he completely nailed it and the chemistry between the bat and the cat was pretty good and we also got to see very vulnerable side of batman the fight scenes were brilliant as well one might say it was little bit stretchy but it was worth it1.0\tso good the characters make me want to cream whenever they go on screen they are simply amazing recommend this so much it is the best batman movie ever watched1.0\tthe batman is the flim had in my life one of the greatest movie greatest crime thriller film in this movie batman is not in action he only in his 2nd year so now only he start the job of cape crusider vigilante dark knight himself so don be disappointed this was just start for this universe but this is masterpiece1.0\twhile not my favorite take on gotham orphan vigilante feel that this version of batman needed to be told very dark wet and gritty but didn find it as menacing as reviews suggested seemed to drag bit during the first act but by the second act the film is sure to have your undivided attention really hope this universe continues feel that robert pattinson batman will be fleshed out and more members of the bat family gets introduced1.0\twas little skeptic about pattinson as batman but man he was just outstanding loved every part of the movie shows what the dark knight truly means0.0\tbeing fan of batman was pretty excited to welcome in the new pattinson version to this franchise it would be great to explore gritty younger batman honing his detective skills and for some meaningful flare use fancy gadgets which is part of what made him the one of the greats yet after aftering setting this visually this new darker feel and edge has gotten out of control no light humor to lighten the characters and get us to bond to them and for high percentage of the movie literally couldn see the movie it was mostly shot at night and no relief for your eyes which strained bit to catch some fairly important details the dialogue was uninspiring nothing to write home about as may have been spoiled since watching christian bale bane deliver some gems that repeat to this day patterson acting ability was actually pretty good and give him no bad mark as pretty sure he fulfilled the writers director mark on the movie but the script is terrible even old major villain from the batman franchise felt like an afterthought to the movie choice of an unfamiliar bad guy zoë kravitz actually outshone patterson by an inch and really did well revising the character the story felt initially compelling and worth digging deeper into to unravel what could ve been really good mystery and shine batman high iq detective skills but nope batman felt like an afterthought almost like rich kid trying to figure out the world and finding his place in in sorry this new realism or woke element isn necessary in today expectation of batman or maybe old school or asking too much of him comics prior movies may have spoiled me where are the gadgets the batmobile was in the shadows and hard to see can tell really what truly looking at was it some garage clunker muscle car or what sorry was deeply disappointed in the story and myself as like previous viewer almost fell asleep times in the movie not worth cinema money you need to watch this at home where you turn up your tv light features to high brightness and watch this at your own place overall wouldn re watch as this batman has absolutely no place standing next to any major justice league character again no real fault to pattinson please redo do the story is this isn it1.0\tcrime thriller for the ages matt reeves has put onscreen the type of batman movie that ve been waiting for the dark knight is one of my very movies of all time and this movie is right there with it can go on and on about the things love about it but gonna say just about everything loved it1.0\tthis movie is gonna change the whole superhero genre it game changing matt reeves is genius this probably edges the dark knight in terms of quality portrayal performances tdk edges the batman in terms rewatchability the only con is the length which is fine for me but certain audiences might not approve of it1.0\tthis movie really had beautiufl cinemotagraphy stunning acting and great plot pattinson showes great emotions while acting and it was really dark and serious and for hour movie enjoyed every second of it amazing movie and cant wait for the sequel1.0\tthrilling the film takes almost hours but it so engrossing that you don feel that you just can look away because this story is so intriguing really enjoyed the fact that the batman story contains digressions to the modern reality there were also couple of funny scenes which breached the dark movie ambience also the cast was great they really breathe life into the characters1.0\tthis film is dark gritty smart complex and poignant it is arguably as good as tim burton original and better than nolan batman begins though in my opinion dark knight is still the best overall batman movie riddler is deep frightening and intriguing his puzzles walk that fine line of being difficult but solvable for the audience often when batman spits out solution it was just on the tip of your tongue dano is masterful as psychopathic genius with more than screw loose channeling kevin spacey in seven at times all of the major characters are richly written and masterfully acted kravits is enticing playful and sympathetic farrell completely disappears into the penguin pattinson is even surprisingly good batman though on negative note he plays neither the witty cultured bruce wayne of keaton nor the over the top ostentatious bruce wayne of bale in fact pattinson doesn really do much with bruce wayne at all0.0\thorrendous three hours of my life never getting back he can act it was so dark could barely see anything it went from whispers that could hear to booming noise that wasn needed long drawn out talking scenes full of nothing incredibly shallow characters it was saw meets seven just like you said but both of those movies are hundred times better than this rubbish1.0\treally enjoyed the noir style of this film robert pattinson was young raw batman the length of the film was perfect for the story it had to tell overall the movie is amazing and look forward to more films like this from matt reeves would give this 101.0\tfinally got out completely excited from the movies after watching super hero movie is not for everybody have to say but it was absolutely delight1.0\tthis isn kids batman movie it is dark and gloomy with heavy feel bruce wayne is tortured young man trying to find way to right the wrongs of the city he grew up in robert pattinson plays the part perfectly as an emotionally stunted bruce who transforms himself into one man vigilante as the early version batman unsure and unconfident to start it long movie but set the stage perfectly for hopefully the next part of the saga that sees batman transform into the superhero that he becomes that we saw develop as the movie ended1.0\twhy is this the best batman movie ll give the short answer and then the long answer short answer best actor in the suit best and most ambitious cinematography fantastic sound design and score respect for and direct use of source material stellar supporting cast great detective story the long answer the batman is neo noir detective story it not superhero movie because batman is not superhero he rich dude in suit we re thrown right into it batman has been fighting crime for years he already friends with jim gordon one of the few uncorrupt cops in gotham the riddler is serial killer targeting corrupt officials of gotham city and they work together to solve the crime they have almost buddy cop vibe even though he doesn know who batman really is along the way batman has run ins with mafiosos penguin and carmine falcone working at their club is selina kyle who he enlists to help him get inside info on them in hopes they ll lead him to riddler she agrees in hopes that she ll find her missing friend it much darker and more adult than previous movies although still acceptable for 12 years and up probably younger depending on what your kids can handle violent but little to no gore blood from wounds or gunshots is noticeably absent from this movie the batman looks incredible this is probably the most typical compliment you ll hear for this movie cinematographer greig fraser hot off the success of the new dune is one of the best in the business and he and the director really made this unique and special they pushed boundaries and broke rules for beautiful results drawing visual inspiration from movies like seven and prisoners as well as movies by wong kar wai but that not to say that it entirely derivative it very much it own thing both in execution and post processing the story is engaging found myself forgetting that was watching batman couple times because it heavily grounded and focused on him being the worlds greatest detective the score in my opinion is the best since danny elfman iconic theme from 1989 then giving way to shirley walker animated series theme michael giacchino clearly took elements of the past and used them to build on and create new modern score the motif and instrumentation are brilliant taking classical and mating it with jazz and other modern sounds the acting in word perfect pattinson plays strong driven batman it dick tracy meets dirty harry as bruce wayne he still as driven but softens himself to more of kurt cobain inspired stoic colin farrell goombah penguin is fantastic it was bold choice that could ve been silly with all the prosthetics but he pulled it off and you don even see farrell under there even the actors was unsure of how they do like john turturro and zoe kravitz did stellar jobs turturro always found too goofy to take seriously but he gives very restrained dignified performance as falcone and though think kravitz is far too awkward in real life to have gotten the seductive part of selina down she got every other part right she was very sexy looking and played it exactly as she should have think this also shows that director matt reeves really knows the material and helped his cast give their very best paul dano riddler is good and respect it but it felt little uneven at times trying to be things he very good acting is phenomenal but it just isn going to get the attention that ledger joker got and unfortunately will be compared to and overshadowed by ledger as movie it does all elements better than its predecessors but it different genre nolan is director who sacrificed story and character development in the name of big visually spectacular action sequences this is the opposite it much more story driven and though there is action it much slower as an adult like this but the average popcorn muncher may not agree as batman movie how anyone could say this isn the best is beyond me in the past we got movies from directors who were incredibly self indulgent and used batman as way to do what they love matt reeves loves batman and he used the source material to craft story not just peppered in for fan service here and there the story is loosely based on batman earth one though neither the director or dc is mentioning this in that storyline alfred is not the butler bruce parents named him guardian if anything happens to them which we all know how that works out thomas wayne is running for mayor against mafioso looking mayor penguin and ge and martha are gunned down alfred and bruce are tense with each other alfred not understanding why he dressing like bat to fight crime or why he doesn carry gun but alfred is the one who trained bruce how to fight the riddler in earth one vol is mad bomber targeting corrupt officials to take over their stranglehold on gotham in this book the batcave is also an abandoned subway station and the batmobile is basically just suped up sports car this isn identical but definitely inspired the batman basic plot however there are elements from batman year one which is where falcone and selina derive their characters from also the computerized contact lenses though much more high tech in the comic are from batman court of owls matt reeves also cited batman ego as an influence and that more tackles the psychological part of batman which is bruce the man or the bat which is the disguise and who has control criticisms even though do think there is room for improvement in these places understand this is studio interference and would be difficult if not impossible to change which is why still rate this movie 10 firstly should ve been rated know wb said it was non negotiable and must be pg 13 but it missed opportunity most kids see rated movies long before they re 17 myself as early as years old and then they could have committed to how dark and disturbing the riddler really was it felt neutered when people get shot and there no blood complaint have about the dark knight too and when people are wounded or attacked there zero gore and lastly you may or may not have heard the controversy over criticism of the batman wokeness dc and presumably parent company wb have been injecting sickening amount of current social ideology into classic properties often swapping race gender or sexual orientation for no reason other than to curry favor with small sects of society and or to virtue signal how progressive they as company are considering this the batman gets off light and it negligible some people say that making jim gordon and catwoman black is an example of race swapping this is untrue first off kravitz looks exactly like selina in batman year one and jeffery wright as gordon simply feels like good casting no it not comic true but his race is never factor in relation to the character the issue is not the people of color they did cast mayor doctor jim gordon it that all of the criminals in gotham just happen to be white except for one meek reluctant gang member who is unwilling to participate but is being pressured by all the other whiter gang members it wouldn be an issue if it wasn so heavy handed and fraudulent know there was some meeting where some executive said well don think it would look very good batman punching minorities which is sad we live in time where someone discomfort and inability to understand race means that actors of color who would ve loved to not only be in batman movie but to fight him were actively passed over to hire white actors all to maintain some facade of progress but even this though noticeable in no way cheapens the experience of the film there is single out of place line about white privileged holes said by selina that definitely feels shoved in and hope for the integrity of matt reeves this too was studio note for all the sjws rolling their eyes that anyone would have problem with this let me break it down for you first off batman is about someone who devotes himself to warring on crime so that no child has to suffer the loss that he has instead of embracing his privilege of wealth not skin color he uses it as tool to help him protect those who cannot protect themselves it is about the haves versus the have nots and to presuppose that no white people in gotham or in reality experience poverty or suffering is ignorant unfair and prejudice the inclusion of racially based line like that takes the concept of classism something that would be uniting and shared struggle between all races and turns it on its head and makes it about race it very out of place and not in tone with the rest of the movie but again not deal breaker it not out of the realm of possibility selina could say something like that but the movie would lose absolutely nothing if it had been kept to rich holes it only there to pander to indoctrinated simpletons who think the individual is defined by their skin color instead of the content of their character art and yes films are art has no responsibility to uphold modern ideology for the same reason we don update the mona lisa every few decades with face tats nose piercing and side shave we need to respect these artist creations as they are and keep personal politics out of it and if you don agree then you were never fan of the property to begin with so that being said watched the film for the 3rd time last night and still love it1.0\tand hollywood just presented another batman character that has been milked out for years and proven once again that it suffers from serious bankruptcy in ideas mean why they should make boring batman movie unless they need more money at the box office in covid era especially that superheroes movies are guaranteed goldmine and as prove for what am saying they are intending to make tv series about the penguin colin farrell mon gimme break think the batman doesn has anything new to give in dull plot that can be running in 90 or 120 minutes maximum as for the positive points the acting is great from pattinson kravitz to farrell all the talented cast also the music is super the batman is batman movie that will never think of watch it again prefer to watch michael keaton batman the dark knight over over instead1.0\tfinally batman movie focuses on batman felt watching arkham games and my favorite batman story the long halloween as mixed each character was perfect batman not saying he is better than the others but he is different from his other incarnations and is definitely one of the best this is more melancholic gothic and noir version of the character catwoman another character with an excellent back story gordon we watched gordon as sidekick and ve never seen another gordon defending batman like that and really like this version penguin they nailed it his makeup accent actions were perfect and the riddler felt that madness felt everything that he felt not going to mention the music the script the cinematography go see for yourself this oscar worthy masterpiece never thougt before ll ever watch batman movie like this after the dark knight trilogy went to the cinema with broken foot and limp it worth it1.0\tthe batman is very dark movie to bad this was not rated otherwise would give it higher rating than 10 this movie was not only dark but very deep solving mysteries the riddler is in my opinion the best character other than batman really do believe that robert patterson did great job from start to finish each character was just as good but not riddler good if you compared heath ledger to riddler in this movie would have to say riddler did an amazing job as well please don hate this movie or don think it wasn good this movie deserves so much more and can wait to see what the next installment have to come0.0\thow on earth it scores over here this movie is boring too long cast performance is mediocre plot is obvious fighting scenes are ridiculous as comic books adaptations fan was curious to see robert pattinson as the batman but in my opinion he doesn fit in this role at all especially after christian bale in the dark knight movies there was literally nothing in this movie could appreciate it felt like it was forcefully prolonged if it was up to 90 minutes give solid stars1.0\tthis version dark knight is more realistic and we can relate with this batman and story wise its not upto the mark of the dark knight but its one of the greatest superhero and batman movie and the detective story of the batman that we never seen before and its just awesome the cinematography rocks and the music just mindblowing and robert pattinson as batman nailed it and other characters also its treat for batman man and for the superhero fans just go and watch in theaters0.0\tenjoy movie with no plot and terrible acting the worst batman movie in decades to follow the last trilogy is trough but damn this is bad no story bad actors and just plain boring tried to watch made it through 30 minutes1.0\tmatt reeves at his best wow expected something big spectacular and it was not disappointing matt reeves proves me that he one the best directors to immerse you in the picture and the feeling of movie and to push even more into it everything was excelent perfectly executed the cast played the roles with their pure talent and devotion from pattison mastering batman bruce to kravitz and her great fantastic take on the cat to dano wow always amazing playing such roles and then to the unrecognizable farrel great amazing and fantastic and all the other words describing my satisfaction of their acting awesome well written and followed script matt reeves again slaying me cinematic excellence movie that could be relived again and again and again that even more difficult to make praise to all the cast and crew1.0\tcommercial movie goers seeking superhero action may not appreciate it as much because this batman is cinematic piece for film lovers matt reeves has crafted dark moody detective thriller led by vengeance and the most chilling riddler we ve seen backed by stunningly haunting score we witness the coolest penguin the sexiest catwoman and the most humanised batman who still in the infancy of vigilantism the plot is clearer to follow than christopher nolan convoluted storylines but it slow burner where still thinking about it days later why almost perfect wasn sold on the casting of alfred nor the length whilst it didn drag my bat did ache1.0\tmatt reeves has always managed to stamp distinctive storytelling and aesthetic signature to each of his works despite remaking classics like the planet of the apes franchise and continues on the same vein now with batman robert pattinson rendering of the dark knight is everything we wanted ben affleck broken cynical and disillusioned mature batman to be and so much more we catch our caped crusader well into year of his return to gotham and having taken up the mask and cowl to clean up the criminal element seeping into every corner of his beloved city we get to explore batman hitherto untapped at least on the big screen world greatest detective persona as he looks to untangle web of riddles and clues en route to catching an elusive serial killer it is eerily fitting that this fincher esque portrayal of the batman got hit theatres on the 15th anniversary of the release of his pièce de résistance zodiac released on march 2007 zoe kravitz is absolutely spellbinding as selina kyle aka catwoman delivering the best on screen depiction of the iconic character since the legendary michelle pfeiffer enthralled us in batman returns 1992 2022 seems to be the year she has decided to make her mark as bankable leading lady after having impressed audiences across the board in the performance heavy thriller kimi available for streaming on amazon prime video matt reeves seems to have let the beast out of its cage with everyone favorite vigilante resorting to grittier more ground level and visceral action to deal with perhaps the darkest most sinister depiction of gotham we have got to see on screen so far there is no sugar coating here the nefarious underbelly of the city is shown in all its depravity and callousness by the director with colin farrell as the penguin and john turturro as carmine falcone playing the power brokers the director seemed to have held back on exploring the full range of the gifted actor in colin farrell who is unrecognizable as the penguin this is perhaps ploy to catch us all by surprise in the reported spinoff series the character will be getting soon paul dano as the riddler puts in stunning performance dangling precariously in the tantalizing grey between moral righteousness and diabolical megalomania cinematographer greig fraser astounds us again with his imaginative frames growing from strength to strength after taking our collective breath away in the oscar nominated dune 2021 the stunning panoramic shots and the dexterous captures of the close combat sequences is nothing short of pathbreaking and has surely raised the standards of audience expectations from superhero films how wish kerala had an imax screen so that could have enjoyed the visuals in all their glory many ridiculed the studio choice of robert pattinson as bruce wayne recalling his much maligned outing in the twilight franchise but clearly those naysayers have missed out on the phenomenal actor that he is especially in films like the lighthouse 2019 high life 2018 and good time 2017 he lends haunting wraith like voice and body language to bruce wayne the broken psyche of his alter ego clearly permeating into his public persona marvel might have an upper hand when it comes to an interconnected universe and beloved fan favorite characters but in matt reeves zack snyder james wan director of the aquaman franchise and jaume collet serra director of the upcoming black adam dc have set of debonair film makers who can elevate the canon to dizzying heights and explore facets of these beloved superheroes that the audience has not been exposed to suffice to say matt reeves darker layered and more unshackled batman is splendid successor to nolan works and stands just peg below the iconic the dark knight 2008 in terms of pure cinematic excellence highly recommended theatre watch catch it in imax if possible1.0\tthis film has it all action horror drama romance comedy everything is so well put together and they knew exactly what they were doing cinematography and color pallet is amazing actors are on fire the story has sense and meaning very thankful for this piece of art0.0\tthis was such highly anticipated movie and it has really good rating on imdb which honestly don understand it no where near as good as the bale batman movies there was just no character development and no chemistry between any of them robert pattinson just played the moody broody role and that it there is no personality that shines through just didn feel any connection to any of the characters and therefore you really don care about what happens the plot is really boring and overall the film felt way too long it really is nowhere near as good as the rating on here suggests1.0\tmatt reeves struck gold with this he got everything down perfectly for the first time ever gotham actually feels like gotham batman actually feels like batman the casting was fantastic pattinson collin jeffrey and zoe were all perfect in their roles the story was engaging and the soundtrack and sound design were absolutely amazing the ending was fitting and heartfelt in soany ways ve never seen batman like this before 10 10 we finally have the world greatest detective1.0\tsolid entry little bit more darker and slower than older entries but nice move and direction the riddler was brilliant in it what character the actor absolutely nailed his role and stole the show some nice fighting and driving scenes highly recommend and look forward to the next one1.0\tthis is an interesting take on batman believe thus far ve seen every movie of this superhero that has come out since the 1980s fan of robert pattinson and so is my wife jaime she expressed interest so we went to the gateway film center to see this movie for this take we are getting another grounded world we are in gotham city and it is overrun with corruption there is crime everywhere batman does scare criminals he is not loved though lt james gordon jeffrey wright seems to have an uneasy friendship with him the rest of the force sees him as menace this starts when mayor don mitchell jr rupert penry jones is murdered violently by the riddler it sets series of events into motion that expose how deep the corruption within gotham has gotten the riddler calls of batman pattinson and in turn bruce wayne batman encounters selina kyle or also known as catwoman zoe kravitz they have two different things they re looking to do but at times it works in tandem what liked about this version is that we re getting murder mystery to start saw comparisons to seven or zodiac coming in and can see that it is neo noir take with superhero twist did enjoy all that the riddler is great villain and the performance there was one of my favorites we even have colin farrell taking on oz or mobster known as penguin ll also throw in kravitz and pattinson who are both good here as well if have an issue this runs too long think this could afford to trim 15 to 30 minutes to tighten it up intrigued by the story but there is bit too much meandering for me despite that did enjoy this quite bit be down for sequel for sure other positives were the cinematography and soundtrack it is dark take once again on this classic character my rating out of 100.0\twhat long bore perfect actors for the roles but it did drag on way too much found it hard to stay awake in parts good idea for batman movie but it did not have to mood shot after mood shot1.0\tfor batman fans this movie is like dream the batman riddler commissioner gordon catwoman everyone were perfect in there performance awesome thriller movie with awesome action sequences each and every frame of this movie is beauty1.0\tthis was such great detective batman movie that really brought the best out of lot of characters while thought it was on its way to or 10 the final act one id call the 4th act hit and we left that detective setting instead we got very lazy action sequence that wasnt needed in the story that was told for most the movie still very good but man there was chance at something truly top level here0.0\ttrying to turn batman into superman they completely don understand the character robert has the same look attitude and demeanor throughout the movie even though batman is the true identity and bruce wayne is the character he plays movie is one dimensional just go rewatch dark night1.0\tlong but very worthwhile the storyline was excellent the dialogue not overly cheesy like in most superhero movies and the overall feel was very dark and bleak as it should be in batman movie it very much noir style crime drama not action packed but definitely enough to keep you from getting bored the acting performances were nothing special but very solid overall although honestly thought paul dano as the riddler was little over the top but pattinson gets thumbs up as the new batman overall the dark knight is still by far the best batman movie for me but this is strong contender for second place1.0\tdark and delight love the movie it was great met the standards of dark knight it again batman beginning hope so they continue the trend the voice is great for dark movie classic and master piece0.0\tthis has to be the worst batman movie ve ever seen 2nd to ben affelk way too long confusing plot with dumb trivial nonsense don waste your money on this garbage1.0\tnew batman movie with robert pattinson stunning in the role of batman apart from that the story is totally gripping the action scenes are incredible the music is great too found an excellent batman movie and his universe most of the actors are at the top1.0\tadmit was skeptical when first heard robert pattinson was cast but ate my words and holy crap robert pattinson was an great batman and hopefully there more to come1.0\tbatman is not hiding in the shadows he is the shadow patiently waited to see this movie on the big screen and was not disappointed it was very good batman movie have seen them all and it is different version and glad loved cat woman in this version robert pattinson and zoe kravitz were awesome as the bat and the cat hope there will be another movie didn think it was too long thought the length was just right for the film the riddler was really creepy loved the costumes also and the music it is very well made film1.0\twas bit skeptical when learned team edward was playing batman but wow finally movie even darker than the dark knight this in my opinion should have been rated and that good thing1.0\tagain went into this one not expecting much from rp but he did actually pretty dumb good think this was the final step to get out of the sparkly vampire role that has plagued him this was dark kinda twisted kinda felt like batman from another timeline universe hopefully we see sequel0.0\tthis is hours of my life will never get back since when does batman movies have actual music in it the only good part was them in the last few minutes1.0\tthe batman takes cues from many films but the first that comes to mind for me is batman hush my wife and both loved this more basic damaged revenge focused 30 something version of the crusader this tale dispenses with copious amounts of cgi high tech weapons super human feats of strength and other less believable attributes and gets back to what more realistic anti hero the batman might be soul searching rage filled focused and yet doubtful he making difference his batcave is more like an engineer garage the batmobile much like the man himself blunt instrument of rage even the detective fighting skills differ from the smooth trained martial arts style we ve seen in past iterations now he brawler beating men down with speed and harsh pounding that could only be delivered by an adrenaline and rage fueled victim of crime seeking release of said rage the usual chase fight and flight scenes are all here but the film doesn rely on them as past films have and there may be some blowback from viewers looking for more eye candy the batmobile has one major appearance but it gave me goosebumps could watch it 50 times this is batman raw and it beautiful thing1.0\tjustice served at the hands of vengeance theatrical presentation of superhero realism in the most genuine manner of portrayal the saviour beyond the mere cape cowl vaudevillian antics the utterly selfless devotion towards protection of innocence is what proves the batman to so accurately be the deserving hero for any city riddled with repeated violations of law order on multiple levels and counts1.0\tthe batman has all the characteristics of great movie the story is intricate yet coherent while the way the writers bring the superhero to life balances plausibility and fiction the characters are obscure and at the end of the day it not too clear who is the bad guy which is always great way to get the audience to interpret the movie in their own way the directing is clean with easy to read action and overall beautiful camera positioning as for the cinematography fraser manages to capture the moody and dangerous atmosphere of gotham without becoming repetitive and the fact that every scene has its own color scheme greatly contributes to the emotional impact of the movie as whole at the same time the vfx are playing key role in the creation of the uniform and detailed world as well as in bringing to life some truly breathtaking and unforgettable shots0.0\tmore happens in 24 minute cartoon like batman the brave and the bold than happens in this movie at least in the cartoon you can see bright colors here there is barely enough light to illuminate the plus hours of boredom boredom boredom did the director or anybody involved in this movie even read batman comic book this batman story has so many inconsistencies yes he moody and yes it dark but batman is very much involved in high tech wizardry gadgets and there scene where he actually writing with pen batman along with superman are the premiere super heros in the world batman has always been character with many layers many say that batman is the true iteration with bruce the mask the role needs and the needs talented and physical fit actor this is beyond robert pattinson bailiwick the scene with pattinson as bruce in the hospital against pennyworth played by the great english actor andy serkis is extremely painful to watch the contrast is huge pattinson has the acting chops of cardboard box there are other issues with pattinson but it seems like they went out of their way to make pattinson look stupid bored unsexy and even look like the joker with the long greasy hair hair and smudged black eye makeup surrounded by great actors like turturro kravitz wright saarsgard neill and farrell any one of them would have all would make better batman pattinson appears to be horrible choice if you want to see an actor pull off successful super hero check out pablo schreiber in the role of master chief in halo not only does he look the part of super soldier with his huge frame but later when he takes off his helmet he goes from robotic intensity to childlike wonder when he removes his emotion suppression chip so in summary check out halo on paramount and skip this super snoozefest1.0\tjust watched the batman at odeon oldham on isence great film the film was about 45 mins longer than it needed to be but every film these days seems to be between hours long the action scenes were awesome in my opinion might go to see it again before it leaves the big screen thought the storyline was little more complicated than it needed to be but maybe just bit thick the sound was absolutely amazing on isence hope dc drop aquaman and wonder woman to be honest with new the joker and the characters in this film the future looks very bright for dc just drop the dross and stick to the good stuff1.0\tlet go back the years to the past when the dark knight was released when we saw the joker who amazed us in his wonderful role and years later we saw tom hardy with the character ben who also amazed us and is one of the best villains for me but if we compare these films with the 2022 version what is the result first what distinguishes the nolan version and why did it take such huge ratings answer it is because the villain of movie with all its evil and good aspects overpowers me and also makes you love her and this was feature in movie that made us like or say that riddler does good thing and this is what remember well in the dark knight rises second also feature of the nolan trilogy showed us bruce wayne and batman and their struggle and this was neglected by matt reeves in movie that only showed us entirely on the character of batman and this is negative third the melancholy of film that has annoyed many critics from my point of view this is what made great movie and takes you into another life this is gloomy dark unloving batman who does not know what is smiling this is an advantage but it was negative in the nolan trilogy fourth character representation robert succeeded very well in mastering the role of batman and he can compete with actors before him for example ben affleck kristen bale michael keaton and succeeded in attracting you and you can see that through his eyes but that does not make him the best in movie zoe kravtiz who excelled in the role of cat woman and was also wonderful and more wonderful than annie hathaway and also the role of wonderful and deranged riddler the role was highly mastered and of course we will not forget colin farrell who took the role of the penguin to another world and also other roles such as falcon and jeffrey wright andy serkis is great actor but he never took his right to the role of alfred and this was negative especially we love the character of alfred since michael caine andy was supposed to play the role other than alfred because he is unique actor in future sequels fifth the realism of the film that distinguishes it from the christopher nolan trilogy here in the movie there are no planes and big cars in city and weapons that are only found in batman cave very realistic movie even very simple batman car but like it it feature too sixth the batman suit is the coolest and the makeup of very realistic actors special the penguin go compare the penguin here and in the tim burton duo you ll know what want this is movie that must be seen on the largest screen you can reach it must be seen in cinemas very much because action scenes are very elaborate as if they were made on reality not behind green screen there must be world headed by matt reeves and other sequels and prequels movie rating 101.0\tin the past dc has cut out important parts of the movie for the sake of making it shorter batman superman justice league even the dark knight this time they finally did what they always should have done release hour theatrical cut and yes every minute is important many will complain about the long runtime if you can make it through hour movie suggest waiting until it comes out on hbo furthermore this is exactly how batman is supposed to be dark angry and vengeful with all due respect to the christopher nolan trilogy batman just seemed to be more authentic more consistent with who he is in the comics0.0\ttellement ennuyant des beaux plans mais rien de batman il ne infiltre pas rien du batman qu on aime il toque la porte pour rentrer dans des endroits du jamais vue 3h de regard et de musique 15 minutos action moyen par la scene avec la voiture qui est pas mal1.0\tgiacchino might have crafted the most perfect batman score ve ever heard cannot get it out of my head the scene where the batmobile revs up was an unforgettable moment in the theater and the subsequent car chase was one of the most intense action scenes ve seen in years as for the story loved it we get to see batman doing some great detective work working closely with jim gordon and piecing together the riddler scheme beautiful cinematography1.0\tthought this film was impeccable and good way to start new era of batman the acting was captivating from all and the story was interesting even if it seemed stretched out at parts even though it was hour film had no problem sitting to the end of the credits because was so into it also thought the villain big riddler was refreshing and unique addition and it created really eerie atmosphere great watch1.0\tgreat batman movie that begins to fall apart in the final act with some questionable choices scattered throughout it embraces the mystery and detective nature of the character which has been neglected in previous portrayals all while retaining the brutal action the character is known for1.0\tthe movie has feeling of dread that mimics what we are going through now batman has been trying to help for years and things are worse than ever even the bad guys think they are doing the right thing couldn help but see parallel with post pandemic world with all of our technology and heroes in modern medicine why do things still feel so dark have never enjoyed hour movie but this one made me want more1.0\tthe film mainly focuses on investigation and riddles it is kind of similar to zodiac robert pattinson was perfect as the dark knight this was the darkest batman which was major plus point the visuals and cinematography in the film was awesome the music was very gripping and outstanding some people may find the pace of the film as negative thing but overall it is one of the best films the people who say this film is bad are either marvel fans or kids0.0\tthree hours of nothing if wrote the whole movie it won be spoiler review literally there is no story to tell it suppose to be action mysterious movie but the stretching is unbelievable and killed it1.0\tthis movie focusses on pain of the batman this is not an origin movie who are we kidding everybody knows batman origin batman is fighting losing battle against corruption in gotham he tries too hard to control save gotham city and it is eating him from inside he is not even trying to keep up his social appearances bruce thinks the batman work is the only thing that gives his life any meaning and doing it so will honour his parents legacy but he took it far enough that now it is creating problems for the city and himself by inspiring wrong people in this movie batman learnt his lesson to embrace the bruce wayne side more to help the poor along with punishing criminals as vengeance movie production is top notch it has great cinematography music good interesting characters nice storyline thrilling action sequences what more could you ask for1.0\thave to admit was already robert pattinson fan but after this movie even more so he has effectively transformed into batman along with his mystique and powerful performance was sold additionally am super fan of zoe kravitz as well her acting skills are phenomenal paul dano role was surprisingly diabolical can wait to watch second installment1.0\tabsolutely love the evolution of batman and this movie does not fail now we have darker batman and much darker gotham sinister gotham underworld the movie is great for me it was batman with touch of nolan batman but far more serious story line with little of the crow vibe with being goth crossed with the zodiac and seven it really worked for me and thought robert pattinsons portrayal was superb batman and hope he returns for sequel not as woke as some suggest and certainly nowhere near as woke as spider man1.0\tsurprised by pattinson act as batman the police investigation movie the atmosfere simple batman dark silent misterious masterpiece deserves several sequels and join joaquim as joker will blow the oscars1.0\tit was an experience we were lucky to go through it was an experience we were lucky to go through it was an experience we were lucky to go through it was an experience we were lucky to go through1.0\twas very dark thriller that as the subject says didn feel like batman movie but definitely not in negative way extremely good interpretation of the character gritty and hit all the right markers to make it an engaging watch no dull moments1.0\tthis iteration of the dark knight had the ability of forcing my heart to pound and my palms to sweat throughout the entire hour run pattinsons portrayal of mentally broken and traumatized vigilante is seen through the emotion he delivers throughout this batman feels like dangerous creature you do not want to cross whenever he steps into the room great ties to original source material from famous batman graphic novels as well reeves was able to give comic fans noir detective batman we have never seen with compelling mystery to keep the audience interested and involved very original comic book movie batman and gordon classic partnership against gotham criminal element shines the supporting cast completely stole the show wright kravitz ferrel dano were all amazing1.0\tthe main thing people need to know when they re walking into this movie is that this movie is not like any other batman movies you ve seen before and that what makes this movie stand out the story for this movie is not going to be for everybody as this movie is first and foremost crime movie and that what made it interesting for me really enjoyed the parts where it showed them trying to solve these clues and figure out where to go next and in between still having time to develop these characters due to this story being mainly crime thriller there isn much action in this movie but the action that is in this movie was really well done the fight scenes in this movie definitely aren the most memorable but matt reeves the director and co writer still made sure that the action for this movie was nice and smooth and easy to follow along with now with this movie mainly being crime movie with very little action in it and nearly being three hours long you might be wondering what the pacing for this movie is like and well it definitely not the fastest paced this movie is slow burn movie and unlike some other movies where slow pacing hurts it here it works for it with the slower pacing you get the full detective story and not need to rush anything or have to skip over certain parts the story for this movie is attention grabbing so you never fully feel how slow the pacing is anyways another element in this movie that helps the audience not notice the pacing is that of the acting for this movie everybody in this movie gives it their all and through these performances help the audience better understand these characters and want to route for them when robert pattinson was first announced to be playing batman in this movie there was hesitation behind it but he has the most captivating performance in this movie he plays both bruce wayne and batman in whole new way that we ve never seen any other actors play him before and for certain parts make him relatable jeffrey wright who plays james gordon and andy serkis who plays alfred were also real standouts in this movie even if the acting performances don captivate you another part of this movie probably will and that the cinematography for this movie the cinematography for this movie is just outstanding and gorgeous to look at and it really needs to be viewed on big screen also love the lighting for this movie and specifically how it appears to mainly be natural lighting the lighting combined with the set design for this movie really brought gotham to whole other level in showing how bleak and hopeless this city is the final part of this movie that want to mention is that of the musical score the musical score composed by michael giacchino is the final part of this movie that brings the audience along for this mystery journey the music is amazing and really captivates what this movie is and the tone of it in the end matt reeves unique take on these iconic characters is breath of fresh air and has an interesting character study element to it as well the batman is not going to be for everybody but for those who want to see more detective batman movie will enjoy this movie lot1.0\tlike how reality grounded the batman is this movie sucks you right in and hands down the best depiction of gotham like how he is hero who doesn always succeed and his transformation throughout the movie is amazing in the beginning he was vengeance but in the end he trying to be beacon of hope for the people of gotham1.0\tslow paced movie with the right atmosphere and setting for batman robert does fine job justice to its name dark batman hits the screen where we get to know the detective batman as well as his development whilst the movie proceeds lived up the hype and expectations0.0\tmillenial batman doesnt like violence political correct super slow pace weak story the batman is sad all the time 2008 emo unnecesary batman movie release1.0\tthis batman is its own character and love it didn think anything could outdo christopher nolan batman movies but this is peer different its own creature love the dark moody brooding atmosphere throughout exactly what gotham and its dark son could be and robert pattinson is still gorgeous he fab bat0.0\tmy girlfriend and myself spent hours to take nap pattison is great batman but my god never wanted to leave movie theater that bad in while1.0\twhen saw that robert pattinson was cast as batman immediately thought that would not watch the movie because the main character was the guy from twilight after watching the movie with couple of my friends realized that the dark spin on the movie made it very good watch and would recommend it for other people to watch the movie shows you how deep batman resent is and how much he wants to put people behind bars paul dano was probably the best actor that have every seen play the riddler and was very surprised by his performance in the movie he added cynical and insane twist to the riddler showing what the riddler might act like in real life all in all the movie was very great to watch and would recommend watching before spoilers start coming out1.0\tlet cut to the chase and just say it this is the best most faithful rendition of the batman character in movie period the movie is film noir detective story thriller character centric essay and it is beautiful matt reeves understands batman yes the movie moves quite slowly but when the pace picks up it doesn hold back the car chase you get glimpse of in the trailer is absolutely fantastic and feels fast dangerous and loud the general atmosphere is super dark the cast is nothing short of amazing pattinson is incredible paul dano should be given an award for his portrayal of the riddler zoe kravitz is fantastic catwoman and jeffrey wright is great gordon that one scene with pattinson and dano you see seconds of in the trailer is masterclass in acting gotham feels dirty grimy and dangerous and for once you actually get to experience the city let take minute to praise the soundtrack as well amazing work by probably the best film music composer in activity today michael giacchino not just great batman movie but great movie period and probably the best batman movie ever hope there sequel that remains faithful to this fantastic take on the story need to watch that movie again and again1.0\tthere lot to like about this new reboot of the beloved superhero we all have come to know and love where chris nolan grounded batman in reality like we hadn seen before matt reeves takes that to the absolute next level the comic bookyness of batman is largely lost and to fault at times robert pattinson is actually pretty great batman but his bruce wayne is indistinguishable to his caped crusader ego to point where you have to assume the entire city is completely brainless to not realize he batman wayne story is tied heavily into the narrative but this disconnect can be so distracting as it almost feels like bruce wayne is nebulous rather than real character within the film however when batman and gordon are in under the radar investigation mode the film really shines zoe kravitz is sprinkled into the narrative in really tasteful way that makes lots of sense and develops her character well she may be my favorite selina kyle that has hit the silver screen and her look and attitude fit the dark mood of the picture oh yeah did mention this movie is dark like not just in content but in literal darkness even the day scenes are darker than some night scenes from chris nolan batman it kind of insane this style choice doesn bug me for the most part except with the action sequences the dark and rainy scenes with flashes of little bits of light coming in can be cool but after and half hours it gets bit old and wish they could have introduced just little bit more variety with the action sequences other performances are mostly stellar paul dano is great collin farrel completely transforms in way that impressive from the actor and his make up team jefferey wright fits gordon well and although the hour run time is noticed it really not too poorly paced at all some thematic elements are reminicent of old material but what this brings fresh can be quite enjoyable at times not as good as chris nolan trilogy except for that awful third film but quite solid and worth continuing into some sequels1.0\tignore the bad reviews especially if you re batman fan after watching the batman and then the entire dark knight trilogy can honestly say reeves managed to encapsulate what burton schumacher and nolan couldn reeves crafted this movie with perfect blend of realism and comic book inspiration the score is excellent and serves to add another depth of emotion to every scene in the movie the cast is wonderful throughout for the first time ever we got live action riddler that was true and terrifying threat to batman not to mention penguin who farrell completed transformed into then there also kravitz catwoman turturro falcone wright gordon and of course pattinson batman this iteration of batman is undoubtedly the best yet reeves choice of exploring wayne trauma was perfect as it allowed batman to fully understand himself and what he must be for gotham best batman movie perhaps the best comic book movie and one of the best movies ve seen alongside seven shawshank redemption and schindler list1.0\tno words will do it justice on how good this movie is it was the batman we needed and wanted everyone was cast perfectly and they all played their part accordingly no one needed carrying and they all held their own the hour run time is absolutely necessary it showed everything becoming of superhero starting out and the realism was absolutely superb and refreshing will definitely be seeing this again before it leaves the cinema possibly even 3rd time yes it just that good before saw this movie had no idea who matt reeves was but from here on out will never forget his name nor will anyone else because of the great job he did as writer and director of the batman this movie deserves to be trilogy hopefully part and part are already in the works do yourself favour go and watch the batman it will definitely be the best decision you will make this year1.0\tco written and directed by matt reeves the batman takes different route from the usual tropes of the superhero genre and instead delivers suspenseful crime thriller as well as deep character study of the titular character with masterful execution in all aspects of filmmaking the batman takes the genre in unique and interesting directions and establishes itself as one of the best comic book movies ever made while simultaneously showcasing one of the best iterations of the titular character with masterfully written script and flawless direction matt reeves has created an engaging and suspenseful neo noir crime thriller and the most realistic and grounded depiction of batman ever put to film reeve directorial talent shines bright throughout the film especially through his usage of visual storytelling which is particularly evident during the opening sequence which accurately conveys the terror and dread which batman has induced in the criminals of gotham another remarkable aspect was the incredibly crafted and visually impressive action set pieces which were coupled with impeccably choreographed fight sequences despite runtime of nearly hours the film keeps you engrossed throughout without single dull moment in between the film is filled with top notch performances all across the board robert pattinson delivers yet another stellar performance once again proving his incredible talent and range as batman he portrays much darker younger and relatively inexperienced version of the character he plays an emotionally damaged broody and asocial bruce wayne which is much different from the charismatic and gregarious versions of the character portrayed by the likes of christian bale and michael keaton the different take on the character is utilized to create narratively satisfying character arc for bruce pattinson acting talents shines the brightest in sequences where he is able to succesfully convey wide range of emotions and feelings without uttering single word even when his face is covered under mask for the majority of the runtime another standout performance was by paul dano who puts forward terrifying and unsettling performance as the riddler dano portrays sinister complex and unnerving version of the riddler which is completely different from the comedic and goofy take on the character by jim carrey despite the limited screentime andy serkis displays truly memorable performance as alfred other major cast members such as zoe kravitz jeffrey wright and colin farrell also showcase brilliant performances one of the strongest aspects of the film was the magnificent cinematography by greg fraser who once again exhibits his talents behind the camera after his groundbreaking work in dune the film is filled with meticulously crafted and visually stunning shots with immaculate attention to detail the cinematography combined with the incredible production design brings about the best depiction of gotham city in any live action batman movie so far micheal giacchino adds yet another incredible score to his already stacked list of impressive film scores despite being distinct from the iconic works of danny elfman and hans zimmer giacchino has composed spectacular score that perfectly fits the titular character as well as the tone of the film the costume design is also worth mentioning as we get to see what is arguably the best version of the bat suit in live action with exceptional work in the fields of writing direction performances cinematography and score the batman takes the titular character and the genre in grounded gritty and mature direction with two proposed sequels in the works the batman has promising future ahead as well as the potential to spawn one of the greatest trilogies of all time1.0\tthe batman is good film with its portrayal of gotham city and its corruption matt reeves does stellar job slowly revealing the clues and breaking down the crime aspect of the story plot however having played all the games and read the comics found the movie disappointing the way the movie portrays bruce wayne even though action scenes were shot well it felt too grounded for batman movie even though appreciate its realism left the theater wanting little more of batman action0.0\tlong tedious dark film not much of story robert pattinson makes horrible batman the only bright spot was catwoman wish could get back the hours of time wastedmm by on this horrific movie1.0\tthe batman was actually really good but the penguin was little strange for bad guy he didn have any actual penguin with him and he owned club so that was weird to me1.0\tjust watch it it was great experience to watch such masterpiece the director really pulled off something and brought to level to nolan movies robert patterson was such great batman1.0\tlove how this movie portrays current political establishment bruce wayne and the police try to handle riots and rampant crime all over the city while the establishment democrats are just all corrupt and run the whole thing to the ground while banking millions and there one guy who is demented fighting for being mistreated at an orphan house that the state democrats have supposedly had funding for and he blaming on the wayne family watch this movie with an open mind especially the end who are these guards defending your freedom or truth1.0\tthe batman is the first film of new batman film series this film is directed partly written and produced by matt reeves before this he directed dawn of the planets of the apes and cloverfield in the film bruce wayne robert pattinson has been active as the batman for just two years protecting the streets of gotham city from criminals when new sadistic serial killer the riddler paul dano in gotham targets key political figures batman is put to another level to test his protection of the city together with lt james gordon jeffrey wright the lone agent on his side and the mysterious selina kyle zoë kravitz must help batman riddler solve his mysteries in order to avoid new victims and save the city with this new batman movie they are once again bringing forward new version of batman story for new batman movie series with this series they convey the story in more dark and serious way without making it as realistic as in the dark knight trilogy they portray the film more as crime drama with batman as the investigative detective matt reeves and peter craig have also written the film in way that the viewer can also try to solve the riddles yet like batman they continue to lead you astray so that you may begin to question your own ideas and research the action in the film makes for entertaining fight scenes but batman does more research than actually fighting enemies still the few fight scenes come across well for batman who is still in his early stages this makes this batman bit more brutal compared to other versions of batman from previous batman films so this film is more serious version of batman story where it is more about solving mysteries and uncovering secrets of different people because they also keep the humor sides of the film small this film can be less entertaining for younger viewers young viewers may lose interest in the film sooner compared to older viewers due to the way the story is told matt reeves and photography director greig fraser also capture the dark and more depressing atmosphere of gotham city they do this cleverly by largely playing the story during rainy dark nights where batman investigates or stops criminals he does this by silently making use of the dark atmosphere composer michael giacchino also knows how to provide suitable soundtrack in the film but also uses well known tunes from previous batman films and puts them down in the film in his own well known way the acting is also well done by the film cast in its own way many characters in this film have appeared in previous batman films or series before but in this film they are also portrayed in an appropriate and more dark way robert pattinson knows how to portray the role of novice batman in an appropriate way but the character just like the actor himself still has lot to learn in the continuation of this film in addition to the batman role he also has to play the bruce wayne role but this still needs further work in the front of this series bruce wayne in this film comes across more as shy depressed person who can quickly lose his mind about having secret identity paul dano also portrays the role of the riddler in more dangerous and serious way and sometimes comes across as the jigsaw killer from the saw movies because of his actions colin farrell also portrays his role as the criminal the penguin in good way and is barely recognizable in the film thanks to his make up and costume the rest of the film cast also portray the well known and new roles in this film in an appropriate and individual way1.0\tjust left the theater from this movie and it leaves you with certain high if you re fan of detective noir with batman involved you are in for treat the action sprinkled in is perfect and pattinson is brutal as young bruce wayne gonna go see it again but the overall performances from everyone gave depth to their characters matt reeves did genius job delivering this portrayal of young batman1.0\tabsolutely fantastic movie slow burn builds up and up and leaves you questing your ideology off the west and movies in general great movie to see and it complexe1.0\tbest version of gotham fear element thriller outstanding performance awesome cinematography dark batman movie we all were craving for simply cinematic masterpiece from matt reeves1.0\tthe pace is slower but the atmosphere is very well rendered although there are not many martial arts plays they are very exciting in the end the actor is super handsome1.0\tthe batman is 10 10 movie every second was worth the watch the score is just perfect this movie is so good that you want sequel so bad but you can have it so you start reading batman comics instead trust me reading comics and watching this makes you understand the movie in different dimension for movie fans this is just good movie with good character with good villain but for batman comic readers this is wish come true masterpiece that actually uses comic details for example scott snyder eye lenses and scott snyder zero year if you have never read comics before but you want to because is this legendary movie recommend reading the whole batman new 52 series anyways know that this will someday go down on history as one of the world greatest movies1.0\tthis movie is about on par with the dark knight and actually preferred it due to its darker theme robert pattinson shines as the main protagonist and is supported by stellar cast can wait for the sequels1.0\tthis batman movie is the best go see it action packed with noir style crime thriller what we all been wanting batman movie to be matt reevs did an awesome job along with the cast perfect1.0\tits amazing to see early stage of batman and his detective abilities it also delivers that he is not only fighter but detective also it has comic references all over the movie robert pattinson nailed his acting as bruce as traumatic child and early stage dark knight1.0\tthe movie was one of the most awaited movies for me it was worth it great in acting cinematography direction and action btw the storytelling of the movie in the first half could ve been better0.0\tthe batman of 2022 three hours long beautifully executed masterfully decorated long awaited disappointment you come to the theater for the batman and you await globallity of the main story line external or internal external like in nolan dark knight or internal like in joker you get neither in this instead you get no character development reckless expenses on production without real dramatic justification lame dialogues no humor whatsoever it could have been great and whole production of this film is great set design cinematography casting sound design make up choreography everything you see that people worked so hard to make this movie and surely people had good intentions but with the screenplay something went really really wrong hope next time they attempt to make new batman movie they first ask me for an advice1.0\tthe batman did exceed my high expectations loved it was gritty dark realistic and had an amazing visual flair yes it has some zodiac and saw moments but it didn spoil it for me all performances were amazing even zoe kravitz convinced me colin farrell is unrecognizable as pinguin and it good to see john torturro back on screen pattinson gave for me one of the best batman performances which couldn quite believe from the first moment heard the casting being released dop and visual effects are just top level glad the music was bit more on the classic violin level it had some bombastic moments but at the right moments not like full nolan film full of deep bass the only thing is the length did it bore me no it kept good but sometimes the pacing was bit off and some scenes kept on dragging 30min less would have been appreciated and make it even more strong but the batman really is on that too shelf can wait to see more1.0\tfresh grounded and thrilling the batman provides its fans entertainment from phenomenal performance of the cast and compelling story by matt reeves1.0\tdon even know where to start so here it goes this movie exceeds all expectations the writing the acting the cast the visual appearance of this film is exceptional set aside from christian bale batman robert pattinson kills it the is must watch and must buy in any format of your desire wow loved every minute of the movie what film1.0\twent into the theater expecting reeves to put new twist on the batman and he did that and more pattinsons batman is unlike anything seen on the big screen before and the supporting cast is just as excellent there is about 45 minutes of this movie that would say is the holy grail of batman and is just perfection hope this movie gets the love it deserves1.0\tsee it soon and mad hype my epic name is b0nzai if your trying to run some fortnite batman is better than spider man am going with my friend zach after school and we are seeing it at amc theaters am going to get popcorn and drink and we are in the row we saw spider man front row and it wasn that good but now we are in good spot so this movie will be gas batman is the coolest super hero and he could beat up the avengers and the goofy mcu all together1.0\tbit weird pacing in certain scenes however the cinematic and story was spot on can wait for the sequel colin farrell as the penguin was absolutely amazing think he was the star of the movie for me somehow in bleak universe portrayed throughout he was able to crack out some jokes without killing the tone perfect casting choice and rob as batman was hit or miss for me when announced but he took my words out my mouth and he an absolute hit amazing choice easily up there with christian bale as the best batman hands down the best bruce wayne1.0\twas not having high expectations initially coming in because of how bad batman vs superman was was very pleasantly surprised how good this film was the riddler was sadistic crazy villain much like the joker in his own way really thought this film was very dark there were times felt like was watching rated batman hats off to robert pattinson on his take of batman it was very enjoyable to watch and can wait to see what the sequels hold1.0\tthe hype is real every character portrayal was perfect already cannot wait for the sequel spin offs batman film unlike anything we ve seen before and it does great job of blending all different types of source material as as well as making unique story of its own1.0\tan awesome film with an excellent story you are on the edge of your seats when the action comes in the riddler is straight up scary this is finally one movie watched with my father that made him talk about it after it was over battinson is amazing too you will keep trying to figure out what gonna happen next and that is what makes movie special the batmobile chase is insane too definitely the best batman movie in my eyes1.0\tno spoilers finally experienced the batman the way we were supposed to atleast in my opinion mat reeves take on batman was excellent he presented batman in perfect way robert pattinson done wonderful job as batman and the riddler hits hard music added more effect to the scenes goosebumps guaranteed story is developed perfectly and ended in more realistic way personally recommend to watch this in imax or theatre with better sound1.0\tthe movie exceeded my expectation to the highest level the degree of detail in this movie it depicts batman still fresh to the cape things yet he is darker than shadow and brighter than light events that aren relapsed like the previous ones ve seen chain of events so complex an experience that reached the peak of darkness sweet enough to enjoy1.0\tthis movie exceeded all my expectations for me this is the first comic book movie to comparable to the dark knight completely in love with everything in this movie the soundtrack the cast the story the setting gotham everything robert pattinson was born to play this part zoë kravitz is perfect as catwoman jeffrey wright does an amazing job as comissioner gordon paul dano is amazing as the riddler colin farrell is amazing as penguin1.0\tthe only people who gave this movie 10 are just mcu kids they can admit that there are better cbm than the mcu the movie started very well the soundtrack was amazing had the chance to watch on imax and wow it was so good every scene showed how smart and brutal can batman be the movie is 100 worth watching0.0\tit is the worst batman movie have ever seen do not waste your time and money on this movie bad story bad audition and bad everything even if you got free ticket do not waste your time1.0\tthis movie is so good held my pee for three hours and probably have uti cannot fault it it was visually just beautiful with fantasticly dark gothic gotham as it should be when saw the wayne mannor was floored patty did great job with batman and think he really portrayed broken angry unhinged man trying desperately to make difference have lot more to say but honestly just go see it because it an incredible addition to the franchise and you ll enjoy every minute of it1.0\tthis movie has it all beautiful cinematography great action great acting great story and even some horror elements sprinkled on top batman film for the ages1.0\tas good as joaquin phoenix joker movie same tone the darker the better it hypnotic the cast did an amazing portrayal of their characters speaking of characters it great character building kind of movie what don get is zack snyder got axed from continuing justice league for being too dark but they allow the batman joker and suicide squad to be even darker and violent like wtf warner brothers smh restorethesnyderverse1.0\tkept going back and forth between rating or 10 but couldn find single flaw in this movie gotham looked like it was straight out of video game look ve said enough the movie was 10 10 go watch it and support dc1.0\tthats it dc continue please like this movie good story good actors thats it yeah you re not marvel you are dc and you must being like dc remember thats it perfectly thank you dc1.0\treally liked it robs performance as batman was brilliant however didn like him as much as bruce wayne film was great bit to long for my liking though0.0\tthere is too much of everything we left after 1h30 was bored and my partner as well don know how it ended but my feeling is that it never started so many sequences could be much shorter1.0\tvery good batman already established as figure nice mysterious enemy who is on the verge of psychological thriller batman gets to show his logical thinking beyond just raw strength also feels modern considering the recruitment of enemies online and how corrupt the police can be0.0\tthe acting was not great at all the dialogue was very poor to me action scenes seemed very cheap the batman costume and all the gadgets also seemed cheap hours long and most of it was pointless this was great value brand batman1.0\tdetective movie makes batman more human and ordinary unlike superpowered alien or science fiction type batman who had the wrong idea who just wanted vengeance and make up for his guilt0.0\tthis movie sucked would go into everything about it but it not even worth that the only thing worth while in this movie was the supporting cast as far as being edgy dark twisted is lame excuse to say it sucked he the anti batman his lame acting and weak presence doesn call superhero it seems more like he want to write blog about his experience and for hr movie you get more action from titanic if you are comic book fan warned you1.0\thatts of to the director matt reeves for giving such an amazing direction and make the film worth to watch from cinematography screenplay music the main highlight dialogues of this movie are totally amazing to watch robert pattinson is the perfect choice to play this role and he has proved it in this movie that why he is such versatile actor zoe shines throughout the film and the rest of the cast are satisfied too director has taken us the perfect comic book story of detective batman and he has done an extremely great job while making it movie is long but you didn feel bore at any time it has suspense twist turns and perfect climax to end if you are batman fan just go and watch it you ll shock to see such great film it is1.0\tcast acting plot cinematography colour grading action mystery everything this movie is peeerfeeectttt this is the greatest batman movie not even close matt reeves love you am so hyping batverse0.0\tthink its bad film the story is too slow and weak the main actor of film is bad too hours can be hour film one of the worst films of batman0.0\tas we say in new york city this movie was tryashhhhhhhhhhhhhh absolutely embarrassing to even call this thing movie would have much rather stared at blank screen for hours the riddler seemed like forced personality didn really match his modus operandi seemed like they were trying too hard to replicate the success from the previous neurotic and erratic joker roles but missed completely and the character was just appalling to watch in an attempt to grasp on to any modicum of identity someone please get jim carrey on the phone fight scenes were garbage car scenes were garbage this movie is supposed to be set in present day but the batman tech was ancient oh and get robert pattinson out of here what an awful casting selection please someone get christian bale on the phone thank the movie gods for zoe kravitz besides her this was an absolute disaster of film zoe if you re reading this handsome single male from nyc holla at ya boy xoxo1.0\tas an avid batman connoisseur felt nervous to see this performance am from the age of michael keaton val kilmer and george clooney batman all of whom brought something different to the character but seemed to miss key element one was either good bruce or good bat never both then came the age of christian bale who is wonderful actor but still wasn my batman he played typical yuppy adult bruce who like keaton and clooney version wanted to be in the limelight constantly the films were great in their own right but once again something felt off then robert enters dc knowing lot of his film work felt he would be up to the challenge but was excited to see what he did with the character finally after 30 years and many different renditions ve found my batman one in which bruce and the bat are cohesive the same person with the same fears and desires robert was flawless the score cinematography co cast every element of this film were impeccable am so excited and waiting with baited breath for second of the robert zoë batman franchise1.0\teverything is was amazing especially the fight scenes overall like it but the march of events was very slowly selina kyle catwoman role doesn suit anyone other than zoë kravitz she like was born to play this character and robert pattinson bruce wayne so emo but like it he perfectly portrayed the batman character think his batman is the best batman ever the director matt reeves did good job am waiting impatiently for the batman0.0\tnolan trilogy was amazing this is very slow and actually quite boring without the bat character this would be good detective film the batman just doesn work patterson doesn work bring back nolan and some of the more colourful dc characters into film they should have gone in the same direction as they did with the joker dc needs to regroup and rethink their strategies0.0\tdon waste your 3hrs to watch this unless you have severe insomnia lol the story and the characters are so bored there isn single storyline that makes me want to keep reading and there really no need to stretch an hour movie to hours1.0\tthis is the single greatest superhero movie ve ever seen this also made it into my top 10 superhero movies have never done that everything in this movie is masterfully crafted and pieced together the acting cinematography music action and horror are 10 10 robert pattinson is the best batman paul dano riddler is fantastic villain there are some genuine plot twists in this that didn expect this movie outclasses tdk trilogy by 1000 one of the best movies ve ever seen0.0\tthis is quite possibly the worst batman movie have ever seen would not recommend this to anyone be better off to not waste your money on this in my opinion1.0\tabsolutely amazing movie patterson had the perfect role and dano deserves an oscar the duo of the bat and the cat is sensational and penguins casting was perfect1.0\tsaw film early at an imax special event this was honestly the first dc film that was genuinely really excited for and it didn disappoint the cinematography is stunning the action well paced the story was solid and the actors all came out swinging with amazing performances it hard to find balance between the costumed heroes and their mundane counterparts but pattinson gave truly stellar performance as both can wait to see it again1.0\tbreath of fresh air matt reeves delivers one of the best superhero movies yet with gorgeous visuals superb acting and an excellent villain the batman earns its extended runtime by giving the audience an unforgettable experience1.0\tfresh take on dark universe with endless possibilities walked out of the theater and heard someone call this movie beautiful nightmare and think that the perfect way to describe it it definitely one of the darkest batman movies and it takes advantage of its dark atmosphere in the best ways first thing that sticks out is the fact that this movie plays up the fact that gotham is kind of terrible place not just crime on the ground or corruption at the top the entire city is flawed to its core and batman may be fighting losing battle not only that but they do well showing the fear element of batman character without giving away too much it didn take me long to realize that this was going to be batman as we know him and at his most intense secondly was hands down the performances really worked for me robert pattinson wasn bringing anything new to the table per se but he also wasn trying to reinvent the wheel so was ok with it it not new take on the character by any means but it also bits and pieces of what we already know mixed with what bruce wayne would turn into in this particular world thankfully the rest of the performances are all uphill think this is the best casting ve seen utilizing these characters genuinely finding myself struggle to come up with any weak performances in this movie they bring new dimensions to the characters we already know showing what they would become in gotham such as this something else to commend is the tone and consistency of the atmosphere they knew what direction they wanted to take and they stuck with it they weren cracking jokes every 30 seconds to keep the audience giggling they weren compromising the tense moments with needless jump scares they weren over the top with any cartoony characters none of that it was good change of pace now that every superhero movie has to be as close to marvel as they can the rest of my thoughts mostly go into spoiler territory so ll leave off with this this movie is not safe take on marketable character to put butts in seats it down to earth suspenseful terrifying and uncompromised piece of art that reminds me why love batman so much thought uncharted was going to be my favorite movie of the year for while but the truth was unmasked right in front of me1.0\tthis is the batman just like wanted it to be serious dark and very stylish gotham city looks absolutely stunning in this movie gloomy gritty shady maybe even little oppresive the way this movie was directed is just phenomenal pattinson as batman coming from the shadows and beating villains is just badass think we all can say pattinson surpassed himself this role suits him well all the effects and visuals in general is so beautiful in this movie worth watch in big screen definitely first rated then increased to must re watch one of the best 2022 easily great cinematography1.0\tnot sure why there lot of negative reviews yes the movie can be slow in places but what wrong with that it always progressing the story line think people have gotten too used to marvel and their constant cgi and fight scenes this was in my opinion as enjoyable as the christopher nolan movies however it is not comparable to them other than by my enjoyment to watch1.0\tit also have some special appearance that will cause chaos in your mind got goosebumps every single time when the theme music of mr vengeance entry will recommend every single person to go watch the movie1.0\tbest batman film as persone who saw every batman film exsept the that no one want to see and who saw regret about it truly enjoyed this one the film strarts with batman kiks some crimnals and than after that all the movie is like and intresting police case that we get cloos and we need to solve the film super dark thats how true batman movie needes to be robert pattinson was great batman zoe kravits stole the show as catwoman and most of all paul deno give as very scarry apperment of the riddler go watch now0.0\tgreat cast good cinematography decent idea vision however poorly executed by the director editor and sound design crew dc seems to not understand that great movies require great directors don blame anyone but the execs making decisions for the dc universe matt reeves has done nothing but produce generic bland content why in the world would you give him the reins to such an ambitious script vision kudos to anyone who can actually finish this boring uninspiring movie1.0\teverything about this movie was amazing the hero the villains the plot and ending this was the first batman we re the movie was centered around batman instead of the villain and love it1.0\tit one of the better batman movies for sure but it not on the same level as the dark knight let start with the positives this is fully realized vision with nobody getting in the way it always nice to see one passion project come to life without any studio interference respect matt reeves as filmmaker he fights for the things he wants to make and he very ambitious these things certainly show with this film he also good visual director and when it comes to writing he does lot of research and he always trying to do something different while haven really liked any of matt reeves films ve always had some positive things to say about them with the exception of let me in can say that this is the best movie have seen from him what liked the take on the riddler and batman the performances the attention to detail the cinematography the visual style the score the story colin ferrell makeup the action scenes the sound design the characters the movie didn feel like three hours the attempts at humor weren bad they either got chuckle out of me or made me smile the cast was never bored that it different take on batman that it not an origin story that zack snyder had nothing to do with it what didn like some of the dialogue matt reeves was inspired by se7en and while there is an argument to be made that several of the references made were meant to be homages they really walked the line between ripoffs and homages at least that how it felt to me however se7en is in my top ten no it not number seven tempting as it was so might be overreacting wish there was more gore they should ve done what se7en did and show us the grizzly afterviews of the murders know need wide audience but think you have to do what best for the art felt as though some of the narration was unnecessary they could have just relied on visuals not sure how feel about andy serkis as alfred don get me wrong andy serkis is an amazing and criminally underrated actor but he was weird choice to play character like alfred am all for different takes on characters and pattinson played both roles well but bruce was the same character both inside the suit and outside the suit respect that reeves wanted to do something different with bruce wayne but think he should have been playboy by day and vigilante by night think the main song could ve been used less as cool as the visual was those automatic rifles should ve knocked batman on his ass think about it ll definitely be seeing this one again and feel as though my rating is likely to go up and looking forward to the next films in this franchise having superhero films this dark is refreshing and this film while not perfect is definitely step in good direction1.0\tan excellent piece of work had to wait for 10 years to get worth watching batman movie dark side of batman same as the animated series character dark and detective batman worth watching1.0\tin the latest installment of the batman movie series am not the only one saying this movie raises to the standards of the previous nolan series of batman movies and the film also places the whole batman universe to the present day within our day to day social trends and technology about the actors robert pattinson brings his new maturer but still young and wild style to play bruce wayne and who could play the dark knight detective better than the one who played vampire in the twilight series catwoman looks slick and reminds me of the version played by halle berry in 2004 catwoman movie still have to watch commissioner gordon think it the first time the police man is played by non 100 white actor but he does very good job the other important characters like alfred or penguin are in place very well played also was quite surprised to see who played the penguin pattinson batman character faces different villain this time as last time batman played by christian bale was facing brute force enemy bane this time pattinson batman has to make use of his cunning skills to match the riddler it is good great and may be very likeable even for the non batman fans1.0\tas someone who hates remakes and wondered what more could be added with another batman movie have to say this movie exceeded my expectations by 1000 while the movie was extremely long there were so many moments that it was worth sitting through the almost hours the action was settled on plot that was actually meaningful and the message wasn cliche or pandering could go on and on but watch it it worth it1.0\tidk if exaggerating but know one thing for sure this is how superheroes movies meant to be since the first minute till the last it was all perfect tha actors did great job on thier roles the characters building the reasonable villains etc1.0\tone of the best batman movies like the take of young and unexperienced his detective skills we re delightful the emotional scenes this movie deserves every praise1.0\tif se7en and zodiac and prisoners and the dark knight had baby it would be the batman and that is fantastic so many elements of this film are masterfully done the score cinematography acting sets and the writing robert pattinson has proved the haters wrong he was incredible his acting with just his eyes when he in the cowl conveys so much and he has changed his legacy as the sparkling vampire to the darkest and first detective batman on film may be bias but my all time favourite villain is riddler and this film done the character justice and made him utterly terrifying and unpredictable paul dano is the man this movie is on par with the dark knight for me as the best batman movie and want sequel so bad 10 100.0\tfor the first talking scene thought was watching new sherlock holmes in batman costume the whole movie was dark the pattinson character made me feel like am watching the twilight again he wasn like hero but non stop sad and helpless man sorry but this was the worst batman movie ever seen0.0\tsorry again robert batman is not for you to play we have to admit after batman the dark knight it is getting hard to play that role where is the madness that joker has where is the determination that pain has the story is bit different but not that interesting also the cast is weak no fear in their eyes no helplessness on their faces no sorrow for their sadness love batman movies but not this one1.0\tjust wonder how many marvel fans wrote bogus reviews and bad scored it haha on that note loved the batman some great performances and nice edition to my collection this will be hey marvel fans the batman will see you at the oscars next year oh wait sorry you you weren invited keep trying you try hard marvel fans1.0\tthe director matt reeves who co wrote shovels previous bat films into one roaring furnace there are beautiful representations of tim burton ghothy angst christopher nolan criminal politics and zack snyder operatic brutality combined with the standalone joker movie psychological backstory vaguely timeless design and layers of dark irony batman is clearly linked to the riddler voyeurism and violence questioning the caped crusader methods more than previous films it also the first batman film to engage with the revisionist take that bruce wayne is wealthy man whose hobby is hospitalizing poor people like the joker movie the batman explores the radicalizing effect of inequality on repressed populace it the batman because it evokes many previous incarnations of the caped crusader while still bringing something distinctive this darkest dark knight may not be for everyone and certainly not for kids but it gripping and nerve shredding bat thriller1.0\tin the beginning when they announced robert as batman had lot of doubts but the film was the best in terms of directing the co stars were perfect and robert as batman was perfect0.0\twas looking forward to new batman movie had my doubts seeing pattinson and kravitz is in this movie and my oh my do they deliver this is the worst and most boring batman movie have ever seen pattinson walks talks and moves slow no wonder the movie is three almost hours the acting is so bad how on earth did pattinson and kravitz get cast for this movie1.0\tthis cinema just sparked the founding flame of neo noir am satisfied beyond words thanks to its runtime noir where hero has doubts trusts very few narrates doesn cracks jokes owns pain actually investigates the visuals one word would like to finish reviewing visuals with one word that is beautiful suggestion watch this on rainy day it gave me the zodiac plus se7en vibe who going to hate that this is perfect slap to those who were saying three hour dc movie is going to flop zzz zzz etcetra forget protagonist what tremendously made cinema it built tension where its needed every scene synced perfectly with the background score the cast gave their respective bests you can possibly ask for more classic fondlers like me who die for noirs like chinatown taxi driver and any cohen brothers movie are worshippers of this the way robert batman is deducing scene the way he choosing not to answer the way he adjusting to every situation shows he not master at vigilantism but he trying to be best that matters quite alot cuz you have seen batmen who just kicks and wins but you haven seen all the struggles he faced before all the kicking winning the audio well nobody ever before gave nirvana chance these days you can never find song featured in cinema trailer to be in that damn movie few have applied this but this cinema mastered this move using nirvana music suits this generations existential issue same applies to this year one batman batman without technology or experience batman who is robust batman who confused of his own decisions batman who starts with vengeance but ends with hope that sounds like my type of batman sobbs it didn topped nolan batman cause it just made its own checkpoint cause it doesn have to love it just like the way it is flawed in common term slow yet harrowingly beautiful and batman which this younger generation can relate to btw kurt wouldn have been too happy with wb using his song but by seeing young different edgy batman using his song not those perfectly geeky playboy batmen1.0\tafter long wait the batman is finally here and it worth it clearly the movie has justified everything it has promised with huge fandom all over the world pretty sure it gonna satisfy everybody some scenes and frames gave me chills while watching in imax the shades of the gotham city were pleasing and beautiful in the frame which really sets batman kinda vibe fascinating cinematography extraordinary music great storyline with all this can easily say that it one of the well crafted batman movie ever made credits to the director matt reeves for pulling this off robert pattinson as the batman is just perfect zoe kravitz as selina kyle steals the show special mention to jeffery wright who played james gordon the length of the movie is being criticised over but as far as my concern it watchable giving it cause there were some elements where feel that it could ve been notch better but otherwise there no room for negatives in this movie the batman is banger to watch it in the big screens and have stired up expectations for the next one0.0\tatmosphere in the movie was great dark tone was good the batman looked cool but dont get how people think he was even close to being good detective he literally didnt figure out anything meaningful was served all the clues by the riddler on silver platter was literally chasing his own tail the whole movie couldnt fight for either comparing this to the dark knight batman this batman was more like one of the hockey pad goons pretending to be batman also whats up with saving kid from car that wouldnt even have hit the kid like atleast make the kid stand in the immediate trajectory of the car1.0\tall this years for new bat movies as dark as the bat was worth it without spoiling the story the chemistry between gordon and batman is excellent and the relation between all the characters are well built love to see 3h movies because it so rare for this days in theatre it allows to write big and story and we have the time to develop the synopsis well the movies is just perfect music colors we can fill the air of gotham true the screen 10 101.0\tlove how the riddler seems bad in the mask but looks like normal citizen in the outside lot of amazing action scenes it deserves to have an oscar1.0\ton the 23rd of august 2020 the first trailer for the batman dropped nevermind that the director matt reeves cloverfield said only 25 of the film had been shot it featured scene with robert pattinson good time as the batman single handedly demolishing gang member and declaring that he was vengeance did not need to see another single piece of marketing from then on was sold but did the finished product live up to the hype of that trailer from year and half ago or has the marketing department been taking lessons from 2016 suicide squad with only the spider man and james bond franchise to rival it batman has had more iterations than almost any other cinematic character we have had adam west camp crusader michael keaton gothic nightmare christian bale grounded soldier and ben affleck tortured veteran however none of them nor most of the animated efforts have ever truly utilised batman moniker as the world greatest detective something matt reeves clearly looked to rectify the batman finds our titular vigilante in his second year of crime fighting as he comes face to face with paul dano riddler colin farrell penguin and zoë kravitz catwoman in crime epic that threatens to change the face of batman bruce wayne and gotham forever despite my excitement from the beatdown in the initial trailer was pleased to discover the batman is less of an action film and more fincher esque psychological crime thriller therefore like with many fincher films the most intense scenes in the batman don come from grand display of martial arts and gun fire but instead they come from two characters merely having conversation thus paired with booming score and gorgeous cinematography the film never fails to captivate although some will cite the lack of action as segway to criticise the film pacing for me reeves use of long drawn out tension building makes the inevitable action based catharsis that much more gratifying plus when the action does kick in it is truly crowd pleasing spectacle with batmobile chase being the highlight whilst was thrilled with robert pattinson casting as the caped crusader lot of criticism due primarily to his involvement in the twilight saga was thrown at him with many feeling he could not bring the necessary weight and presence needed for the role however if you have seen any of pattinson filmography that doesn involve sparkly vampires you will know that all of those worries are unfounded his batman is tortured brooding and an occasionally immature hero he is young inexperienced and more prone to shouting and violence than any previous iteration even affleck this places him perfectly in probably the grimmest gotham ever put to screen where he is not the only player with the belief that fear is tool alongside our hero colin farrell disappears into the role of penguin jeffrey wright as gordan gives wonderfully subdued performance and paul dano is twistedly sinister riddler however the movie has secret weapon move over michelle pfieffer there is new catwoman in town matching pattinson in embodying their role is zoë kravitz who perfectly captures the capable smart and secretly deadly nature of selina kyle even embracing some of the quirkier aspects of the character so many cats thus as the story develops and as she becomes an emotional moral and physical foil for batman kravitz is able to expertly carve out her own wonderful interpretation for this icon of comics could rave about the batman for so much longer and maybe one day will in the same way that spider man is for others batman is my hero he is the one grew up watching and he is the one wanted to be when was older so sorry not sorry if this review is little biased but from michael giacchino amazing score which keep humming to myself to the cinematography which puts it in contention for the best looking comic book film ever to the casting and characterisations it all just works for me criticisms do exist such as its length and particularly frustrating and lazy cameo but these are minute ultimately truly hope the batman is successful because the potential for reeves world is far more exciting to me than anything the dceu or the mcu is offering right now as for the obligatory but how does it compare to the dark knight question there is not much point attempting to answer it they are too far apart same characters yes but wildly different interpretations it would be like asking which is better cats or dogs yes they both have four legs fur and are cute but ultimately it just matter of opinion1.0\talthough batman is not my favorite hero also have lot of expectations for batman this movie feels as good as before superheroes are really cool and cool love superheroes0.0\tan extremely slow boring movie that is more like casual detective than batman movie from the beginning couldn take it seriously since nobody really took batman seriously or didn seem to have the slightest influence in the scenario lot of awkward moments of silence with him once in while going angry but not convincing not to mention about the catwoman and that romance that has become an instagram thing or something lot of people are comparing it to the dark knight but not even close1.0\trobert patterson makes an incredible batman this long movie was gripping from beginning to end have not seen good batman since heath ledger rip but the characters were believable and the story was great love zoey she was great catwoman suki and channing must be proud1.0\twith all the hype and publicity surrounding this film it wasn one had circled on my calendar but after whole lot of effort from my 16 year old daughter begrudgingly went to see this film and what great film ve read lots of positive reviews about new take on the batman but was really shocked at film brave enough to strip back and make much darker even more than the terrific nolan trilogy more realistic main protagonist and cast with no fantastic super machines just raw stripped back muscle car with monster v8 rear mounted as the batmobile normal motorbike for him to use as daily ride the big bar are menacing and the good guys don have pearly white veneers refreshing change1.0\tdefinitely the best film adaptation of gotham its hero great soundtrack great visual effects great story even greater characters everything in this film feels tangible exciting undoubtably the best first instalment of batman series to date1.0\tomg this is the batman movie have always wanted robert pattinson is the best batman the darkest night every scene of the movie is heartwarming and an art matt reeves is the goat loved his vision this batman movie is entirely distinctive from any other batman movie this batman is struggling failing but keep on trying and never gives up he is young but already has such profound love for gotham city that he is even prepared to sacrifice his life although it is just 2nd year of him being batman he is already so much dedicated to his city which is fascinating to watch everyone should watch it in the theatre as soon as possible1.0\tit great to see modern batman movie deviate from relying on the more popular villain the joker paul dano as the riddler is exceptional and it shows him in his wildest at the start of his criminal career the penguin transition into power also tightly packs into narrative that is so well expressed that we forget how long we ve been watching this movie for to start with had fleeting feeling from the trailers that pattinson could be the best batman yet and boy did he prove me right there could be debate about it but there no doubt that reeves chose the perfect actor for the part kravitz as kyle is also thrill to watch the emotional rollercoaster that she goes through especially but the movie brings together inspirations from three different comics batman year two the long halloween and batman ego and other tales there darkness to this movie that adds depth to the story we see the state of mind of batman like never before his scars manifesting in his persona as the caped crusader and worsened by the rise of the riddler he suffocated by his past and his present with the corruption around him he immature and not as feared because it only his second year as the caped crusader but you can see the brilliant detective at play in an excellent game of chase in which batman loses more often than wins also can express how much loved the chemistry between batman and gordon in this movie this is an extraordinary watch that breaks boundaries and reeves made sure to give the overarching plot and the sub plots lot of love by not compressing the run time wow just wow what movie1.0\trobert pattinson emerges from the shadows in this gothic grimey version of the batman with runtime of almost hours it successfully establishes this new gotham and introduces us to the new rogues gallery gotham feels like mix of batman begins and batman 89 as for the rogues must say the penguin is definite standout collin ferrell nailed it paul dano as the riddler was brutal and timid at the same time dare say he almost gave off jim carrey vibes at times making himself out to be victim yet obsessed with his version of success the catwoman batman dynamic was also peak zoe kravitz is effortlessly selena kyle she reminds me of catwoman from batman the animated series jeffery wright embodies the gordon character andy serkis was bit underutilized as alfred but for the scenes he was given was pretty legit the crime gang element grounds this whole movie john turturro is my favorite version of carmine falcone low key yet intimidating this flick is mix between hush the long halloween batman the telltale series and obviously the arkham games as batman parades around gotham city solving the riddlers puzzles we finally get to see batman in his detective element even in his pov batman is the main character not bruce wayne which is refreshing to see the suit can be improved upon which is fine given batman is only in his 2nd year the narrative structure is also top notch not your typical act movie definitely interested to see where this new batverse goes next1.0\tthis movie is very strong for me it delivers on so many things robert pattinson was incredible when first saw the casting choice was confused and wondering why they chose him but he was beyond incredible in this movie the riddler delivers and makes the audience freaked out this movie is just very amazing film and has amazing visuals highly recommend this movie it so good1.0\tafter long time since the end of christopher nolan trilogy batman this version of the batman lives up to the hype it has created this batman is mixture of dark intimidating calm sometimes terrifying and suspense version of batman he also doesn talk too much just like emo version of batman overall it masterpiece1.0\tthe sound track and camera work were phenomenal it is mix of christopher nolan batman with the movie seven with morgan freeman and brad pitt must see1.0\tfirst half of the film is stretched too much its super slow one might feel sleepy there need bit of editing in this part but post intervals its on fire robert pattinson makes the batman look super cool he is awesome in that role but for bruce wayne he is not so charming didnt work for at all paulo dano is amazing as the riddler and zoe is again good casting for selina kyle cinematography is on point movie is dark gloomy and gritty christopher nolan dark knight is by far the best batman from the series and this one is fairly good enough almost there its not wow watch but good one indeed and terrible post credit by dc1.0\tthe theme for the entire movie is dark and gritty and the execution is absolutely amazing liked the plot but the action scenes were what really sold me they re absolutely amazing and the cinematography in this just makes it better only gripe have with this is the length of it it feels little stretched but overall had great time watching it1.0\tmcu is an entertainment business and we need it absolutely but also we need movie that we ve forgotten slowly real one this is kind of pure stuff and yes so satisfied with this somewhat reckless challenge in this age of entertainment well done we really need this0.0\tgrew up watching christopher nolan batman trilogy and now stuck to this one what waste demand my money to be back long boring little action scenes slept in between why god why1.0\tthis is the batman of our generation he is young angry gritty ready to take on the bad guys and he is just starting out we see the world greatest detective at work it not all action there are twists and turn at every corner think riddler was the perfect villian to bring out the detective side of batman robert pattinson and zoë kravitz are both remarkable in their roles according to me robert pattinson is the best batman of all time he adds sense of vulnerability and empathy to the character like never before his personality grows during the whole movie as he realises that along with installing fear into his enemies he also needs to become symbol of hope for the people the cinematography is beautiful as we had already seen in the trailers but nonetheless it is fascinating the overall score by michael giacchino is stunning and thrilling can get the batman theme out of my head overall it is masterpiece1.0\tthe batman tells the story of broken vigilante who is faced with string of murders to solve as batman gets closer and closer to uncovering the truth secrets are revealed about the city he is trying to protect am going to start off by saying this love batman he my favourite comic book character so when saw that he was finally getting new stand alone film my expectations were high after watching the film it did indeed meet my expectations have been waiting long time for wb to do batman film that shows what batman is known for being detective they do this phenomenally the movie progresses very well and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat it being detective story more so than superhero story is what will set it apart from other batman films it allows matt reeves to focus in on the story and worry less about pleasing the audience with action packed scenes had doubts when saw robert pattinson as the bat but after seeing him he is amazing do think he better than bale no don but do think he is on the same level yes one hundred percent he plays very different type of batman his version has been batman for about years or so and has become very broken he questions whether or not he making difference and you can tell that he is starting to wonder if it worth continuing to put on the cape am not familiar with paul dano but my god was he good as riddler his ability to be menacing while not even really being on screen is amazing people are going to compare him to heath ledger as the joker it inevitable if you ask me he is not better than heath but he is almost that caliber zoe kravitz is amazing as catwoman and has some cool chemistry with pattinson her character is big part of the movie and is given the biggest arc the cast all around is great jeffrey wright as jim gordon and his ability to control scene collin ferrell and his amazing portrayal of the classic character penguin andy serkis does really good job as alfred every actor was on the top of their game matt reeves does an amazing job as the director he captures exactly what batman movie should be dark this entire movie is dark and perfectly captures the city of gotham the car chase scene was done very well and had some amazing camera work do have one issue with the film they let the air out of the balloon to soon the actual solving of the murders and the release of gothams dirty secrets happen with about 35 minutes left in the film those last 35 minutes lose the tension and the urgency and it feels less satisfactory for me it not big deal for others it may ruin their opinion of the film overall they did an amazing job the batman delivers story that many fans of the comics have been wanting for while the cast does an amazing job of portraying these classic characters in what is the most comic book accurate gotham city that we have seen on the big screen 101.0\ttruly one of the best comic book movies ve ever seen in long time if not the best ever period this new batman movie was splendid watch from start to finish with incredible acting dialogue really good story an amazing michael giacchino score wonderful visuals cinematography and production designs values very exciting action neat direction and editing etc honestly think this movie even gives the dark knight and logan both run for their respective money and robert pattinson has truly came long way as actor after the twilight series concluded 10 years ago having seen tenet high life and the lighthouse all myself as well matt reeves has truly done fantastic job with this movie and honestly hope it will get follow up someday down the road cause definitely looking forward to some more pattinson bruce wayne batman1.0\tevery aspect of this movie blew me away action cinematography writing musical score acting all 10 10 in my book this movie was incredible that scene with paul dano was oscar worthy1.0\tfor me the first half was one of the best movie experience ever got to see the movie was dark with chills giving soundtrack michael giacchino deserves an oscar and epic scenes superb screenwriting beautiful cinematography and performances the first half was revving at full throttle however found the second half bit out of place anyway this is must watch movie for superhero fans robert pattinson absolutely nailed as batman 101.0\tthis is hyper realistic batman the closest we ve seen to what batman will actually be in real life if he existed this is se7en meets batman nothing in this felt superhuman instead the villain felt quite realistic the antagonist felt like an entity rather than an individual which can be good or bad depending on your taste usually like my superheroes super and my villains as animated as the joker in the dark knight but this was an excellent rendition of this other side of the coin we got excellent acting performances all around zoë kravitz especially did an amazing job don think pattinson was the best batman or the best bruce wayne but he did catch the vibe this movie was going for and to be honest that was his job overall think this movie is worth watching for any batman and detective movie fan 100.0\tabsolutely horrible the twilight guy is still the twilight guy but just playing dress up the mopey emo bruce wayne is theatrical and overly dramatic this generation of movie makers simply have to create something new reinventing movies that have been reinvented is just getting old and it wouldn be movie in 2022 without the term white privilege being thrown in no need for that garbage and at length of almost weeks well that what it felt like it way too long the cheesy dramatic 50 style hollywood movie music in the weird romantic scenes was the icing on the cake enjoy1.0\tpattinson does an incredible job as batman find it annoying that people are always mentioning twilight he is an incredible actor and does an amazing job as method actor sure he is no christian bale or even michael keeton but he does an incredible job colin farrell plays thr tiddler amazingly he is an amazing method actor go see the movie1.0\twho ever saw that this meek man who plays psychological damaged characters would be good match is genius loved everything about this film and it was such beautiful filmed movie patterson as batman and zoe kravitz as catwoman is just what this franchise needed to not get consumed by wokism honestly think this is the best batman yet and the way the story gets deep into the mind and heart of batman was much needed1.0\tamong more recent batmen ben affleck was better as batman but robert pattinson dominates christian bale in the role that bar wasn particularly high though paul dano as the riddler was fairly good but couldn stop thinking that someone else would have done better job ve advocated for weird al yankovich in that role for long time zoe kravitz as catwoman is another positive people warned me in advance that the runtime is annoyingly long and they are correct wish that had edited the film know exactly which parts would have excluded it should have been 30 45 minutes shorter people have complained that it humorless which is incorrect it has few subtle jokes but unlike marvel movies it does not linger on them glad that saw it but will probably forget almost everything about it within the next five years1.0\tover year ago when found out rob pattinson was casted was quite pissed after watching this movie am glad he was casted he done fantastic job the movie is engaging thrilling cinematic scenes great narrative well developed characters and sinfully good music had low expectations for this movie when it was announced but take this movie for what it is masterpiece thank you matt reeves1.0\tthis movie was masterpiece the soundtrack the soundtrack the visuals the costumes were phenomenal the investigative theme to the movie almost made it feel like noir film starring batman as the detective0.0\tworst batman movie ever they just seem to get worse each time lame setting no new technology and the actors just sucked patterson was lame catwoman was lame1.0\tthis must bee one of the best movies ve ever seen it had an amazing plot different but amazing cinematography and the acting was excellent was little sceptical about robert pattinson playing batman but he did an excellent job at playing batman and bruce wayne too1.0\ttrailer was good film to match great cast set pieces and gotham looked great story was good the new batman car was awsome and menacing just little long and movie could of been easily 2h 30 instead of over but overall liked it and defo worth 2nd watch on 4k release0.0\tshorten to hours fill with content otherwise stop wasting my time if this is the trend batman is dead to me way too much down time lacking action and story progression1.0\teverything that batman should be reeves and pattinson bring to the movie pattinson exceeded bale in this movie as the best batman ever and with the help of his skills as an actor they probably produced the best batman movie ever surely this one will stand as top best batman and super heroes movies ever dark thriller violent bloody brutal vegeance the batman1.0\tanother batman movie my favorite super hero not going to compare this batman movie with any other movies we all know some were great and others not so much but let focus on the batman 2022 slow and suspenseful yes dark and spooky yes inspired by modern politics and terrorism yes worth watch definitely ve been waiting for decades now for batman film that focuses on more human batman the methodical detective the damaged man this delivers that very well and must say robert pattinson gives an absolutely amazing portrayal as damaged bruce wayne batman wish can say the same about zoe kravitz felt like was watching mannequin with some kind of using catwoman program to operate it but thankfully it didn ruin the movie colin farrell penguin is very fun and great performance making him more of gangster than freak john turturro as carmine falconi was also well done as was jeffrey wrights gordon this film was very well cast except for zoe kravitz sorry just find her extremely bland for some reason she could have had lot more fun with the role but it kind of feels like she was just out there to be an attractive love interest and look really good dunno paul dano riddler is fantastic loved this riddler makeover they really tapped into his narcissism using real life inspirations such as the zodiac killer btk the unabomber and dare say donald trump loved it it was very good modern take on an unusual iconic villain with excellent more realistic fight sequences and really well done cinematography and fairly solid script could have used little more showing rather than telling we get pretty great batman film it just really too bad this is the 10th or so batman film hoping the sequel can keep up the quality and who knows maybe actually surprise us which is hard to do at this point the batman does it best to deliver the goods and it does for being so far along in the franchise1.0\twouldn even imply that this is must watch movie for any superhero movie fan because it definitely not you need to have deep connection with feature film history to fully appreciate this cinematic opus first off the direction is to the tee perfectly matches up with the detective noirs of yester years at least for the first half second half is basically an action movie at heart but works out beautifully around the antagonist story line the best use of sound design in superhero movie hands down just prepare to get your mind blown when the titular character vehicle is introduced the cinematography needs category of its own making gotham look like decrepit run down utopia was tough task but it was achieved effortlessly the main leads performances are just chef kiss especially my dude pattinson he carries the cape crusader torment in his soul perfect casting after ledger joker imho all in all perfect mix of crime noir action thriller 10 10 will watch again1.0\tthis portrayal of batman is none like we ve ever seen before the iteration of batman is almost too good to be true all the times we ve seen batman in the big screens the greatest detective in the world detective skills has always been under utilised matt reeves does really well job incorporating the detective and investigative side to batman who just so raw and someone who battling with his morals the writing and directing is almost second to none and matt reeves has done something that hasn been done in decade that is bring batman on to the big screen while tweaking and making the character so unorthodox while also staying true to the source material and previous portrayals of the character the acting from all the characters are spot on pattinson as batman who still figuring and fighting his inner demons just does his job so well that anyone who even criticised him should take bow zoe kravitz jeffrey wright colin farrell all give strong and ever present performance that certainly doesn go under the radar the catwoman in the tdkr just felt like burden to the script and anne hathaway was lot underused in my opinion zoe kravitz catwoman is probably the best in the big screen even better than michell pfeiffer portrayal lastly paul dano what performance from him to me his performance in the movie has to be one of the best as batman antagonist and wish got to see more of him because he delivered and left no crumbs the cinematography and score and the colour palette is just so beautiful and just makes the already splendid writing and directing even better even thought the movie was hours long the pacing felt so perfect that it left me wanting for more in the end 10 10 for me perfect batman movie which ll be cult classic for years to come while also revolutionising the character in way we ve never seen before kudos matt reeves1.0\tafter painstakingly long wait for it release the batman certainly did not disappoint matt reeves portrayal of gotham is nothing short of beautiful he captures its grit and corruption like no previous film has done before the cinematography in this film is just stunning and really accentuates this depiction of gotham was thrilled when robert pattinson was announced as the new batman as even after some great performances he was still viewed as that guy from twilight however he absolutely nails this role as truly vengeful batman who is yet to forget the death of his parents moreover loved his depiction of bruce wayne quiet recluse who has dropped the previous playboy attitude for one of seclusion after bale performance in the dark knight trilogy didn think he could be topped but after viewing the batman think pattinson slightly edges it zoe kravitz is absolutely brilliant as catwoman whilst paul dano gives an incredible performance as the riddler as my favourite of all the villains was so excited to see the riddler receive darker makeover whilst keeping his psychotic obsession with the batman dano nails this would have loved to see more screen time of him without the mask to delve into his character slightly more however with the potential for further films this could be explored in general the casting and acting is unbelievably good farrell wright and serkis are also brilliant can see why some people have problem with the finale however really enjoyed it as it gave us some indication of what to come for this batman really hope any potential sequels continue to explore deeper darker side of the batverse whilst showing the development of the batman as he continues to rid crime from gotham overall brilliant cinematic experience with the best portrayal of gotham city and arguably the best batman seen on screen1.0\twow just wow went in with kinda mild expectations and it blew my mind this movie is almost perfect in every aspect cinematography is absolutly astonoshing you can clearly see that shots are really well made no shaky cam just good steady shots you can tell that director matt reeves knows his job and does it very well in fact superb casting is terrific everyone and mean everyone done fantastic job on their parts on my opinion everyone crushed it rob was amazing zoe kravitz did excellent as catwoman andy serkis as alfred paul dano as riddler killed it as main villian of this movie colin farell as penguin john turturro and jeffrey wright in their respective roles as well fantastic 10 10 casting soundtrack oh my god soundtrack is on another level story is really really good griity and well constructed like they managed to made batman real scary pacing is almost near perfect sound design is stellar and meant to be heard to on big screen action when is happening it is done well cheoreographed and superbly executed you can tell they are using practical effects for the most of the movie shot and that is just amazing and bravo matt reeves and entire crew of this movie movie doesnt feel like typical superhero movie it has that real grounded approach like something like that can exist in real world taking examples from movies like seven zodiac and little bit of saw messages that movie says delivers it and says it well definitely worth multiple watchings hope in the future we get sequels for this great movie and they are on this level if not better1.0\tmovie was totally based on the struggle of batman and you can see first time the detactive side of batman people who don know before superhero batman is detactive actions and action is great and first time you can see true origin of batman movie was bit slow but you are going to enjoy the slowness just watch the movie with open ears because you are going to hear so many new things about batman1.0\tnot gonna lie the action might be little to long or sometimes hard to keep up but the batman this batman is the best batman we could get robert shows the true side of the btaman dark wounded and tirsty for vengence not saying that the other batmans are not good but this is the true batman the one we want and the one we need1.0\tomg love him really really love him this is the batman want this is the batman in my heart have ever watch this movie five times love it and and really really want the court of owls in the second one please1.0\tone of the best batman movies or the best batman movie gotham is chracter in this movie the riddler ist really good bad guy and my last point is robert pattinson as batman is fantastic1.0\tthe batman completely met my expectations it terrific batman noir and feels like it own kind of graphic novel loved it if you know lot of different batman stories and untraditional tales you ll see things that haven been touched on yet by any movies it is very grounded and was engaged the entire time the ending was tad anti climatic but it fits with the more realistic word they wanted to have will need to see it again but cannot say where it ranks among other batman movies yet its not better than the dark knight but that is the only thing certain of imo robert pattinson is great it doesn feel like any other batman movie we ve had before and that good thing1.0\tanother year another iteration of the bats co and yet we still have the thirst to see another version of him the batman directed by matt reeves shows us how the batman known for so long as the greatest detective bruce is still raw and shows his lack of experience of being batman so that we can see that the persona of bruce and batman are still one dimensional character as we know from previous iteration that bruce is the mask while batman is the real him in this movie he isnt there yet the pace is quite good didnt feel it like hours movie it felt propulsive and engaging hats off to fraser and giacchino for completed this movie to become whole exciting one the ansamble of cast did amazing job the moral argument created by value differences between batman riddler selina and falcone is beautifully played even though in the last act felt little bit flat but the fact that it is the origins of reeve trilogy make me cant wait for any longer to watch the sequel the minimal use of cgi on point jokes great action sequences flowered this movie to become more than lollipop or theme park superhero movie felt like watching se7en and the french connection that set in gotham honestly dont care if the movie become so dark and gritty because it fell into personal preferences not technically aspect of movie even though what people feel about also valid point1.0\tbatman dc fan through good and bad but this movie completely renewed my faith in the batman character and movies the score the cinematography everything was just so damn good thank you0.0\twish if can rate the movie 10 stars that all can say so disappointed of dc they ruined everything that has been done for batman since the beginning of his movies1.0\tdavid fincher classic done by matt reeves no negative impact just batman being the best detective in the dc universe too lengthy movie but running time won be seen due to big story telling1.0\tfinally grounded and realistic superhero movie brilliant acting music thrill and visuals it really feels good to watch dark thriller movies no unnecessary humors no unrealistic all powerful world ending villains no ts no convenient plots if you know what mean seriously looking forward to the sequels1.0\thave been waiting this movie to release from long time like how gotham was so dark and the atmosphere and how the fight sence was so real also it really masterpiece that should continue1.0\treal sucker for dc animated movies although did see all the human movies also just more of an animated kinda guy that said did enjoy this one particular as all the characters pretty much looked kinda animated but not in overplayed goofy way think they finally nailed it pretty much even if take my critical glasses on regarding the actors the story upweighs everything and the love between bat and the cat is classic mean hush as in my favorite animated movie batman hush need say more 101.0\tat first was like robert pattison as batman he not christian bale or ben affleck but this batman movie they delve into bruce wayne past found myself actually liking pattison in this emotional yet heroic role of batman you really hooked from start to finish some great actors zoe kravitz deserves more recognition do recommend it this movie yes would watch it again of course1.0\tusually when ve seen trailer for movie bunch of times several months out and start to get excited for it inevitability the movie is let down the movie has been too hyped up and the trailer shows the best parts etc etc but of course couldn help but get excited at the promise of this movie could robert patterson pull off such character could this movie be as good as it was hyping itself up to be particularly as it was 3hrs long the answer is resounding yes what movie dare say it but robert patterson imo is the best batman we have had now by long shot this movie showed raw batman who didn need gadgets his darkness and shadows are where he gets his power and where he preys fear into the criminal underworld it dark and gripping movie want to see them make one with joaquin phoenix as the joker next1.0\tbelieve it is by far the best batman movie that has been created ever the atmosphere is just stunning and both the villain and batman are well written and produced overall the experience was the best have felt in while approve this movie and suggest it to anyone that wants the ultimate batman experience1.0\tit literally everything you could want in batman movie violence dark settings strip clubs and more these movie even gives you the elements of feeling scared for some characters and the riddler sometimes he is just insane and psycho but sometimes you can feel bad for him the crime and detective work seems so realistic that it scary0.0\tthey tried to get the joker mood going on but it doesn work at all with superhero like batman as fan of batman movies this was complete waste of time long boring terrible1.0\tso finally we get new solo batman film we ve seen bats in lot of other stuff since the dark knight trilogy concluded and not all of it was good christian bale was previously my favorite portrayal of batman robert pattinson now takes up the mantle and he does not disappoint here my review of the batman 2022 the batman is very dark take on the masked vigilante story possibly the most gritty in tone out of all of the films batman has gotten over the years it appears to be set at the beginning of bruce wayne journey as batman but it is not an origin story he has already very much become his alter ego and finished his training he also does not yet have the full trust of the gotham city police with commissioner gordon being the only one to let batman work unimpeded vouching for him on many occasions this time around the villain is the riddler played by paul dano who is very far from his comic counterpart with the film instead opting for clearly psychotic mentally unstable man bent on unmasking the truth about gotham police corruption and of course about batman robert pattinson absolutely knocked it out of the park with his take on batman and seeing as christian bale isn taking the role back any time soon hope he keeps it and we get new trilogy starring him pattinson plays very strong silent batman and hearkens back to bale tone while actually improving on it in some ways his voice when he wearing the mask is perfect not over acted or silly sounding he just sounds like himself but angry very angry as bruce wayne think pattinson needs just bit of work grew to really love the reclusive playboy act that bale brought also see why that wouldn work as well in this movie but pattinson doesn look as natural as bruce wayne as he does as batman it certainly wasn bad or something that ruined the movie just small thing noticed hopefully if we get new trilogy we ll see robert refine his take on bruce wayne because he certainly got the chops for it in this movie it just didn focus lot on that aspect of batman character placed into the mix as well is selina kyle also known as catwoman who this time was played by zoe kravitz catwoman may have been my favorite part of the batman because we got small taste of her backstory and got to see why she chose the path of thief for herself zoe was excellent at showing an emotionally vulnerable yet strong willed version of catwoman and serves well as love interest for the dark knight without becoming overbearing or taking the focus off of what we all wanted to see from batman movie we also had an appearance from colin farrell as the penguin batman villain with very little time on the big screen up until now he does great as side antagonist and is the target of chase sequence which is now one of my absolute favorites ever he wasn too complex which isn bad thing because focusing on two villains at once is very easy way to stretch your movie too thin this one deftly avoids that in favor of more focused plot in closing the batman is everything could have hoped for from batman movie and more it felt for while like nothing was going to live up to the dark knight but thankfully this one delivers in spades showing us the darkest scariest take on batman we ve seen robert pattinson was just as good if not better than my previous favorite actor zoe kravitz was outstanding and effective as catwoman and showed us real emotion as her the riddler was great villain who served this movie purpose well but don think he quite measures up to heath ledger joker that quite bar to overcome though so not surprised genuinely hope that joaquin phoenix takes that role back if they decide to bring joker back in the future because that would make for something truly special0.0\tyou wait for it to get better but that won happen don waste you re time with this horrible and boring movie there nothing more to say to this1.0\tthe batman lives up to its original name detective comics this batman was beautifully crafted physiological thriller that will keep you thinking and immersed the whole ride matt reeves done phenomenal work mastering the storytelling with the beautiful visual and sound experience the acting was top tier jeffery wright jim gordon and robert pattinson batman relationship was everything wanted in batman year movie collins penguin was perfect this is an oscar worthy movie beautiful masterpiece1.0\tits the best batman movie ever ve its action and darkness and also the characters and actors hope that we have more movies about this batman gjgdkdjdhosjsgsjshsgsy1.0\tjust watched this movie and its great the setting cinematographie and sound design everything is 10 10 for me personally loved the trilogy with cristian bale but this new take on bruce wayne and batman with robert pattinson is absolutely fantastic1.0\tnot big action an hour into the movie is when things speed up felt like the final showdown wasn amazing but this batman isn christian bale batman the story with cat women didn care at all penguin scenes were fun the batman action scenes and him in the suit were well done not much bruce wayne in this film he was mostly batman talking to the commisnoer gordon the riddler moments were good but he didn feel like huge menace like joker his outfit seemed comic book basic type riddler little bit of let down better than the joker film but not as good as dark knight batman go see it if you like the character batman1.0\tso the new batman is completely different to the other batmen angry violent and mercilessly its darker scarier the music is spot on especially with nirvana well worth the 2h 50 min can wait for the next one big thumbs up from me1.0\tdidn have much expectations since was unsure about how it be to see robert pattinson as batman but he completely blew my mind have no words it was such great acting in pleasant to see batman with darker side that really loved give the man chance you won regret it photography and music on point during the whole movie it didn feel like hour movie at all very entertaining and beautiful to watch1.0\tlet be honest most of us aren happy about the fact that we might not see affleck batman anymore trust me pattison is really good not because bias cuz he one of my favorite actors but because he is that good it so realistic how bad guys are going around in fear while the bat signal is on when batman sees the little kid who just lost his father and seeing himself in it and how he sometimes lose control as it only been years since he became this masked crusader it important that this movie is batman year as we are not bored with the same old bruce parents murder scenes we ve seen that in batman begins and we ve seen the matured and experienced batman in affleck so this movie clearly portrays the year perfectly1.0\tgotham city is finally its own living breathing character again here as soon as the movie starts was captivated and completely devoured by this stylized metropolis gotham city architecture and building facades are gothic as well as decayed it rains seemingly incessantly and it never gets light the atmosphere is as gloomy as never before the history and scope of corruption and crime are enormous ray of hope shines in the night sky in the form of bat signal which spreads fear and terror among the criminals we finally experience batman as detective and accompany him throughout the film bruce wayne is still young and visibly traumatized by the murder of his parents that why he lives reclusive and is introverted the murder of the waynes is not shown again yet cleverly incorporated into the story bruce wayne is obsessed with being batman he fights not only organized crime or the villain of the week who he then kills towards the end but likewise petty criminals batman doesn have the desired effect on gotham and is therefore still brutal yet he doesn kill and saves respectively saves even criminals from death robert pattinson was the perfect casting choice for this interpretation and is force of nature as batman as bruce wayne and batman he communicates more non verbally pattinson manages to convey what he is thinking and feeling with his eyes alone the voice is like cold whisper no word was too much or out of place for me as batman he seems almost stoic yet you can feel how broken he is underneath the mask and how the rage is just bubbling up inside him pattinson has delivered brilliant acting performance for me and is now my favorite batman andy serkis as alfred pennyworth may not have much screentime but he still left lasting impression on me he is not just butler in fact this interpretation of alfred seems to be inspired by batman earth one he stern and emotionally undercooled he and bruce have disagreements but he still supports him in word and deed in one scene was moved to tears jeffrey wright exudes immense authority as jim gordon he acts here as batman direct partner and harmonizes with him excellently you can see how much they respect and appreciate each other hope to see him again soon in the planned series gotham pd zoë kravitz as selina kyle catwoman was taken straight from the pages of the comics she was born for the role her story is tragic and also made some tears roll her chemistry with pattinson is magical definitely her best acting performance to date in short she is purr fect the riddler is the predestined antagonist for this batman and is also perfectly cast with paul dano this nashton riddler is by far the creepiest interpretation he is ominous and disturbing the puzzles and riddles are clever and challenging they make batman do real detective work colin farrell is unrecognizable as oswald cobblepot penguin still can believe this is supposed to be him he made me laugh several times he is really fun to watch can wait for his spin off series john torturro is brilliant as carmine falcone and not just visually comic book accurate he has charisma and menacing aura his appearance suggests how powerful and influential he is the screentime for the supporting characters was pleasantly distributed and all were cleverly integrated into the story really liked and was impressed by the performances of all the actors as well as the characterizations the cast was thus optimal across the board all of them managed to make me want to see more of them the score by michael giacchino is fantastic it underscores the images and the action excellently giacchino captures the characters and gotham city atmospherically the music sounds gothic mysterious and ominous danny elfman and shirley walker scores are iconic to me and this one so joins them greig fraser cinematography is breathtaking the way he worked with light and shadow was phenomenal no flurry of cuts during action sequences but the camera is slowly guided and catches everything the visual iconography makes the film feel like living comic book for these reasons this batman film looks the most beautiful there are not many action sequences but they are superbly staged and choreographed the bat gadgets are used cleverly and the batmobile is my favorite next to the one from the burton films this film has without doubt both the best fight scenes and the best batmobile chase for me the sound design was insane you could even hear batman footsteps in one scene thought jet was about to take off production designer james chinlund and his team have done an excellent job with attention to detail they have succeeded in transporting gotham city from the comics to the big screen giving it its own gothic and beautiful character the sets look and feel like real locations if hadn been actively following this project wouldn know that sets and virtual production techniques were used love every aspect of this movie so it wasn minute too long for me it was exactly as long as it should be the story was brilliant exciting and captivating ve waited years for this movie and oh boy was it worth the wait my expectations were not only met they were exceeded the batman is the batman movie always wanted to see matt reeves has delivered us an audiovisual masterpiece he takes some artistic liberties but still remains comic book accurate for me no other director has understood and directed batman essence his rogues gallery and gotham city as well as he has the batman is by far the best batman film for me very excited where the journey goes and can wait for sequels and spin offs until then will watch this film several times in the cinema and wish you all lot of fun in the cinema and to all those who still have doubts recommend do yourself favor and experience this piece of art in the theater1.0\tthe film is slow and poor writing at the start gets better but its bit meh worth watching but the dark knight batman begins are better the film is 2hrs 45mins long 30 45mins to long to much filling it and slow scenes nothing like the previous batman films its also very dark when watching it1.0\tso the batman is finally here directed by matt reeves planet of the apes trilogy this new new reboot of the caped crusader is set to be the beginning of new standalone trilogy with multiple spin off series planned penguin gcpd arkham but does this new adaptation of the character work yes yes yes it just been two years since bruce wayne took up the mantle of the dark knight to instill fear among the criminals of gotham city but with serial killer hunting down all the elite corrupt of the city and leaving the batman riddles to solve the vigilante hero must join forces with the people he can trust and bring the killer to justice as far as dark goes the batman is the darkest adaptation till date if had to rate the various batman movies as per their darkness factor then it would look something like this telly tubbies colourful to midnight black schumacher super trippy batman films burton batman films zack snyder justice league dark knight trilogy batman superman dawn of justice the batman matt reeves inspiration for the film were batman year one the long halloween comics batman early days and the serial killer plot robert pattinson fits the bill as young bruce wayne batman who is still learning how to be the saviour his city needs pattinson is perfect for this rendition of the character young vengeful and reckless zoë kravitz is now my favourite catwoman she has the right amount of spunk to play character as sensual as catwoman jim gordon jeffrey wright has more prominent role in this film as he partners with batman to solve crime paul dano unique take on the riddler will send chill down your spine he is menancing as hell andy serkis colin farrell john turturro co star as alfred falcone the penguin all three are incredible in their roles also the best live action falcone till date what works for this batman film is its grounded approach there is nothing extraordinary going on here it is just good old detective work interspaced with some super slick set pieces the batman will be talked about for years to come the sequels and the numerous spin offs will be eagerly anticipated because this adaptation of the dark knight will go down in history as one of the best superhero movies of all time and if you ask me whether this is better than what nolan made well there is no comparison there all batman adaptations have been inspired from different stories and more importantly different filmmakers just consider this as matt reeves version of the character do not miss the batman watch it on the biggest screen available1.0\tah so where to begin having just seen midnight screening of the batman can safely confirm that this movie is indeed very solid film and well worth watching want to be as objective as possible but given the pinnacle standards set by nolan batman films it impossible to not compare the two together given that is it better than or equal to the dark knight no is it better than or equal to batman begins believe so although in different way really really like the blade runner noir detective cyberpunk feel of the film and the immersion of the film in the first two acts is top notch and if the atmospheric aura captured in the first half of the film carried out through the rest of the film would actually say that this film is comparable to tdk the film tries really hard to not retread ground covered in other films which is wise decision which helps to prevent storyline fatigue and you can tell that this film is genuine creative project and not just generic cash grab this iteration of the batman explores the more psychological analytical side of the character with suitable villain in the riddler that is almost saw like as methodical intelligent yet twisted antagonist that being said and hate to say this about long films because love long films but the third act could have been lot better if only because there needed to be more of an understanding of the stakes beforehand which is all can say to remain spoiler free but then perhaps the film never really intended for there to be proper climax as the entire theme of this film is about exploring batman character and the realisation of what batman really is supposed to represent and perhaps achieving that realisation is enough of an ending for some people but for me it wasn you are also left with really important question regarding what cough the exact reason for certain person motives were as in the actual reason for them beyond vague explanation since it so central to the plot hopefully this will be answered in later film battinson has bulked up himself quite bit and although his arms still look bit lanky its passable if you re not nitpicking and he looks far more imposing figure in the suit than ever thought possible he really sells the physicality of batman in particular by clever dialogue or rather the lack of it by just standing there looking down at people while saying nothing which is hilarious but will never understand why the batsuit doesn have full face guard as that critical weak point from an armor design perspective but whatever kravitz is fine actually prefer hathaway version of catwoman but again kravitz is fine you can interpret that either way colin looks amazing in the prosthetics you can tell it him at all and he plays the part very well the riddler is actually quite well acted well thought out villain even though he presents himself masked you can feel the pent up rage in his voice and in many ways actually sympathized with the rationale for his actions which made perfect sense in way cinematography and score are very well done as said the atmosphere in the first half of the film is incredible in retrospect there wasn really all that much action but what scenes there are are great they should have added more quite honestly absolutely no one would complain overall believe that this film achieved what it intended to more or less which is grounded exploration of the earlier days of batman set within detective noir semi origin story although it not the bestest evar iteration it is very solid out of 10 from me and for one am looking forward to see where they take things from here because this has lot of potential to take things to heights even surpassing the dark knight1.0\twell you can say that it is not casual superhero movie it true detective batman story and well crafted by the actors and well driven by matt revees you just have to watch it in once you let start 15 20 min comfortable with you then your excitement level starts increasing time by time it well made movie1.0\tloved the film great story and camera shots good pace third act fell off just bit but it was bold film in the comic book genre would recommend it they did their thang with this one1.0\tacting dark tone sound track pattinson was awesom and makes you feel sorry for his sorrows riddler and penguin were on top falcone was awesome too we just wanted more epic fight scenes but totally loved this film1.0\tthis was one of the best comic book iterations that has come out if you watched this movie and spiderman nwh back to back it wouldn even be close this is next level however did not like the ending and felt has if the riddler performance in the jail was rushed and forced don know if this was because heaths performance in the back of my head while watching but it did lack in that respect1.0\tthis movie exceeded my expectations everything about it was phenomenal it was hours long but it felt like an hour not once did feel bored in any of the scenes this is the best movie portrayal of the batman we ve ever got it showed batman true detective skills robert and zoë were amazing together great chemistry everything was perfect going to watch it again it that good huge thanks to matt reeves you re amazing thank you beyond happy as batman fan1.0\tthis is beauty of its own and loved it intense beautiful and can wait until number the next encounter not me takings dump ever single person from rob pat to penguin cat woman etc was well cast music incredible thankyou1.0\tthis movie is total disaster maybe the people must watch it again to dislike it it is boring this movie do not deserve the rating it is just time waste the batman except robert pattinson acting everything is waste0.0\toh my god was so bored by half of this cr ppy movie and there is absolutely no action lame cat woman fag bad guys not to mention very bad acting it about batman standing in dark places talking slow with deep voice and that about it ve just wasted very very precious hours of my life with the worst bat ever you might enjoy it if you re from this new ggy generation with goth dark pleasures just to see guy playing dress up in latex and playing detective oh let not forget the lamest bat bike ever and another interesting thing if you want to see the bat playing detective but not get bored strongly recommend batman the long halloween part and part hope there no part with mr pattison as the fizique goes christian bale and ben afflec are more adequate and look like the one in the comic books not this joke of vampire that glows during the day1.0\twow that the first word when think of the batman this is by far the best movie of all time it is seven and silence of the lambs as superhero movie matt reeves is such genius he literally took the perfect gaming series which is the arkham series and made picture perfect movie ve seen this movie 11 times and still get the same reaction as if saw it for the first time robert pattinson as batman was the best ve ever seen from character you get whole movie where he is broken as bruce wayne not just quarter of the film like batman begins but as batman you see him just like you see the batman from the arkham games loved the way gotham was filmed it reminded me of the arkham knight version of gotham lastly riddler was fantastic going into this movie had no respect for the riddler but after watching this movie he has earned my respect he was creepy crazy and drove batman insane paul dano will forever be one of my favorite comic book villain actors of all time he is the heath ledger of riddler again such fantastic movie would say anything negative about this film at all matt reeves will win oscar for this movie1.0\tthe best darkest most engaging and complex batman movie ever made after the dark knight with heath ledger this is most definitely worth watch even if you hate the vampire movies and that somehow get you to hate the actors great acting no cringe moments this is how batman is supposed to be0.0\tknow lot of people are going to not like what have to say but at least ben aflex version didn look like weakling and you could actually see his bat suit this movie was so dark it looked like everyone was wearing black you could barely make out the bat suit it was way too long three hours of mostly drama and talking that would put anyone to sleep very little actual action sequences the michael keaton and christian bale films were10 times better no real color to the villains it was like the whole movie was basically black and white don like the addition of political views being put into this socialist the thing about white privilege keep politics out of our damn films it was horrible movie and my kids did not like it either dc needs to get their act together1.0\tbatman allowed at least 20 people die in awful car crash only to get lesson about spanish language kids learn stuff in school cause otherwise you ll have to chase after your teachers across the highway just to learn how much you suck jokes aside it was fine there were handful of fun moments plenty of slow walking posing scenes pocketful of inconsistencies bucketful of mystery solving and whole buttload of pattison making weird looks like he was about to poo pinecone what else could you hope for also my ideolo senses were tingling wanna know if person in front of you is good or bad in batman world check their skin colour it that simple sigh if not for one lil white privilaged men comment from catwoman this small nugget might have slipped to my subconsciousness making me feel like scumbag for being born white so yeah movie was pretty much fine ramming hard and throbbing ideolo into me without my consent not so much1.0\tooo where to start in terms of good movie it exceeds that the story nails how batman is he not this family friendly superhero who hands out lollipops the story was dark the setting had this dark gothic feeling the movie had amazing lighting and in certain scenes had lot of details another thing liked was that there wasn to much lovey dovey stuff no nudity no sex scenes just few kisses certain stuff like that ruins good movie music the music played the right times set the vibe to wonderful foreshadowing to what going to come next glad it wasn dragged out it wasn dragging on with boring scenes that the watcher knew what was coming next kept me on my seat for movie that was that long was amazed on what came next the small details made it too watching the movie and noticing these details shocked me overall would highly recommend the movie personally glad it wasn kid movie not everything needs to surround kid based stereotype it stayed true to who batman is more input about different things the cast was perfect loved how everyone fit their role not once did sit in my seat and go ahh really that ruined the scene there was no trying to hard in the movie final opinion was the movie long yes was it worth it yes would see it again yes is it worth the wait yes glad that it was well thought out glad the villain wasn the same character joker love to nitpick find cheesy moments in these things but honestly this movie is the perfect batman movie they did good1.0\twill just say this this movie is not for everyone its more realistic take on batman with little winks on noir films and burtons and animated series gotham desing this movie as for me took me by suprise and is one of my favs as of today if you like 2h action and fast pace then this is not for you if you like more grounded film then you will love this in short batman finaly looks and feels like batman and is finaly detective what he always was gotham allways had special feeling and its not generic moder city anymore the desing is perfect and mustang oh the mustang1.0\tthis was the purest batman movie ve ever seen the director matt reeves nailed so many characters in just one movie while sort of starting from scratch it was like the batman animated series mixed with the arkham games blending in the story vibe from the comics year one and halloween it was mystery thriller drama noir type of movie more than just traditional superhero beat em up type of film and pattinson especially proved all the haters wrong there wasn point where was bored or felt as if something was unnecessary the action provided in the film especially felt organic and happened only when the situation called for it also visual masterpiece1.0\tmovie really seems to grab your attention right from the start you can tell within the first moments of the movie that it is like no other cbm very noir and detective based storyline that is consistent throughout movie left me curious what sequel would look like1.0\tthis is phenomenal movie to all the dc fans who grew up reading comics and watching animated shows this movie will blow your mind an amazing movie pats did an excellent job paul dano zoe and every one else were at the top of their game true delight for the comic fans we as batman fans have seen so many iterations of the character but this one here is one of kind best batman in live action movie hands down1.0\tevery single detail was so carefully constructed in this film and every aspect of it did the batman universe justice batman is supposed to be the world greatest detective and they really got it right riddler surprised me with how much they nailed the elements of his character the acting was great and batman is just bad ass by far the most realistic interpretation of batman just overall phenomenal was seriously blown away loved every single minute of this film and don understand the negative reviews guessing they never read any comics and only know christian bales version goodbye ben affleck and hello robert patterson was mad when he was casted but he exceeded my expectations by long shot1.0\tthis is by far the best movie ve seen in 2022 pattinson was amazing kravitz was superb cinematography was awesome 10 to the dark knight would watch again1.0\tmy brief initial spoiler free thoughts on the batman the good you re thrown right into the film and it works brilliantly it knows what it is and cuts to the chase the audience was with at the first midnight screening was silent for the whole thing just in awe of this world that is presented on screen paul dano is phenomenal as ever star of the film in my opinion cinematography is stunning colour palette light and framing is exquisite and really helps set the tone really draws back to comic book illustration and the whole gotham vibe certainly one to watch in imax if you can and probably unwatchable on non oled tv hahaha love to rewatch it in imax eventually pattinson batman is great as he has somewhat vulnerable side to him and feels like realistic man the not so good bit too long for its own good and it has few odd plot tangents and unnecessary bits colin farrell is good but doesn get much exposure seemed like an unnecessary character yet one who could really do wonders in sequel we also don quite get to know bruce as character but think that done very purposefully soundtrack was very meh main leitmotif sounds like the imperial march was cool but didn expand or anything it gave me batman returns vibes though but if it was better then the film would ve been awesome will also say that the villain they ve set up for the sequel future seems dull and the actor would not suit the role even though they re good actor then again this is tiny criticism and doesn relate to this film much at all overall provisional score high 10 great new and original take on batman that really applaud and respect0.0\trobert pattinson is the worst batman ever and there is nothing about bruce wayne really just darkest overrated movie you spoiled the soul of batman character1.0\tthis movie is 10 10 for me it great mix of noir david fincher se7en and classic crime movies the acting is excellent robert pattinson batman is magnificent he is batman his eyes tell so much zoe catwoman is my 2nd favorite catwoman ever michelle still the rest of the cast do great job the writing intelligent loved the dark humour the music is fantastic the cinematography beautiful one of the best movies ve seen in recent years watched it yesterday and gonna watch it again today1.0\tcomic book accuracy not the larger than life movie persona actual batman how he operates gotham cities true face matt reeves give us batman we deserve1.0\tnot enough good things to say about this movie from his detective skills to his gadgets and everything in between this movie needs sequel and with pattinson at the helm think we re in good hands1.0\tafter second viewing it stronger the pacing tone and sparingly restraint but potent action sequences reminds me of an old fashioned noir crime caper movie from the 40 it takes it time lingers on it characters and utilises pattinson acting chops well he is very good batman and looks the part the contrast between his true self and his alter ego is nice diversion from what we re used to bruce wayne without the cowl is broken man almost child like but when he dons the suit he becomes someone entirely different holding the screen with his measured performance and inquisitive gaze pattinson carries this movie if it wasn for him not sure stay the distance perhaps sequel with decent story and stronger villain is in order to help compliment this serious actor1.0\tthis movie was such good break from the normal unreal uplifting fiction of modern day superhero movies this shows the true reality of those who batman faces and batman himself0.0\tit the exact story of what bain was trying todo at gotham city in the dark knight movie they only changed is the villain hated the bat car bike cave house even alfred believe most of the movie they are talking above the building roof next to the lame bat sign few shoots reminded me of bollywood if it broadcasted for free on tv won have the temper the watch it again1.0\tthe batman follows the realistic detective adventures of the inexperienced bruce wayne in this one you will not find our smart and resourceful batman instead this is new take on how would batman be if protecting gotham is job and this is bruce first day he lacks his infamous interrogation skills he is not yet fully capable in using his tools to his advantage and he follows leads aimlessly without plan lacking the wit and cleverness of the dark knight definitely very interesting take and retelling of the batman story must watch for all fellow fans of the caped crusader it follows some elements of the new 52 comic books and it delivers very well written story the sound design is something else one of the best ve ever experienced my problem with the batman is the pacing some scenes are fast action packed or very intense followed by slow sequences that add nothing to the story which really kills your hype and excitement as viewer think it can use some more editing to deliver final cut worthy of 9s and 10s but still it is very solid experience dark gritty batman movie and easily one of the best movies of the year1.0\tthis is the perfect batman movie from its characters to the story and the action can wait to see what the future instalments look like in this dark and captivating world that director matt reeves has created must see1.0\tthe batman is one of the depressing dark slow and not fun movies highlights cinematography the riddler action sequences and bgm though the plot seems dragged out unnecessarily and you feel disconnected from the story also editing could have been better feel this maybe because had great expectations let see what upcoming sequels have to offer highly recommended1.0\tthe batman proves yet again that the comic book movie isn genre in and of itself but rather deep pool of stories and characters for talented filmmakers to draw from and infuse into whatever film genre they feel keen to explore in this case noir the batman is dark seedy murder mystery with tone and tempo that strikes beautifully twisted chord where reeves clearly draws that toanl inspiration from some of fincher finest like zodiac and se7en the sprawling story inspiration is plucked straight from the source look at the long halloween year one and hush as it sees the batman systematically unravel the riddler clues following leads down spiraling thread of crime and misery it impressive to say the least the brilliant cinematography score and fight choreography in particular makes the film feel epic but reeves singular vision focuses the film to stay true to the noir genre throughout steering clear of the studio fare blockbuster trappings of mcguffins cgi and 3rd act fodder it ll be remis for me to not mention the batman himself pattinson does great job living up to some lofty expectations his take on the character is unique leaning into an inexperienced and out of depth yet competent and dangerous vigilante detective he given great supportive cast of characters with not single piece of casting that ll leave fans feeling cheated wright jim gordon kravitz selina kyle turturro falcone and serkis alfred all capture the essence of the characters while dano and farrel go all out chewing up the scenery as riddler and penguin respectively perhaps expectations were slightly lower after the previous take on the character but the batman is probably the closest we ll ever get to another the dark knight at the very least it take on the character and the world of gotham that audiences will surely want to see more of and explore further0.0\twas really hoping that it will be as good as tdk series but it really disappoint me riddler was just joke in this movie but didn like it at all0.0\tthink this is one of the most booring batman movie think the third episode was with jim carrey and uderstand the effort to replace that huge mistake but accidently cant say this is better why jim carry much better riddler than this one batman caracter there wants to be comic caracter wich dont like but at least they did it here wants to be dark knight caracter but it become badly acted copy of that so dont know wich is the worst batman movie but at least that one is not that long to suffer about the caracter of batman its scizofrenic two mental disorded caracter the rich playboy with beautifull womens and company to work and the masked demon the angry kid who want revenge in this movie bruce wayne and batman is same an innervated depressed no one we didnt see bruce wayne the company director we saw crow kid with mental disorder same as batman no act at all give three star for pinguin and for the last caracter who apear in the movie no spoiler one star for the cameramen and the effects one star for the costumes even batman never used that thing on his arm probably bombed arrows but who know where is the batman technologies huge qustions the batmobile is ford mustang with some nitro where is the car what can turn to fly or bike or subbmarine or just ride the wall batman only use one technologie the spying eye what hi give to catwomen who is surprisingly good acting and the climbing rope now that one he use most actualy all the time it makes the movie cheap no suprise at all directoring misstakes and mistaken storyline probably other people lost becouse it has dead end somewhere in the third part and there is no out from there so they just closed stupidly0.0\tthis movie was abysmal boring slow and terrible writing the only potential redeeming qualities would have been the action scenes but they were so out of context it actually made it worse was waiting for the movie to start but it never really did there was literally no plot you can really tell what this movie tried to be but it failed terribly this barely even seems like superhero movie why did bruce wayne look like crack addict also was excited to see cat woman in batman movie but her role just made no sense this just seemed like the walmart version of seven don understand where the reviews are coming from this reboot was complete flop1.0\thave no words to describe the experience of this movie don compare this movie to nolan trilogy the batman is masterpiece in it place and it is not fair to compare it with other batman movies1.0\tchris nolan did great job but this is how batman movie should be it dark gritty and violent at times people forget batman is the detective not the all out action hero he is in previous films love how reeves has honoured the comics and gone for more of dark thriller detective feel rather than the whole superhero action vibe marvel are milking it different and as always there will be some who dislike it just remember batman isn an action hero he detective defo as good as if not better than the dark knight1.0\tthe cinematography in this movie is gorgeous it really pictures the deprived and dark gotham the presence of the new batman throughout the whole movie is so profound for the first time he actually looks intimidating and from the start of the movie you understand that batman is also feared by criminals people that try to compare this to the dark night don have the right to do so both amazing in their own ways but this is completely new batman story which we haven seen before we see batman in this movie be more involved as detective as the movie takes on thriller approach all the acting in this movie is top tier and really great story line1.0\tnew generation new sequel of batman movies think this sequel is the best start for batman movies ever for sure there is no movie will be better than the dark knight movie but this movie is better than batman begins robert pattinson surprised me with this great role during this movie soundtracks are awesome1.0\tfinally batman worthy of the darker side of the lore marvel should take note as this is how you make superhero movie if you know the character you know that batman bruce wayne is very damaged person he sometimes is barely able to hold onto his sanity his very life has been consumed with revenge he holds every criminal guilty for his parents being murdered he isn good guy he batman he vengeance he seeks vengeance against the very idea of criminality he doesn want to capture criminals and tie them up in neat little bows and hand them over to the police he want to destroy them he wants them to be afraid to go out at night he doesn kill but what he does is worse than death living nightmare for the criminal environment pattinson absolutely nails the dark and broody bruce wayne who has all but withdrawn completely from society he not happy go lucky playboy billionaire who buys banks on whim and has supermodels on both arms he damaged soul living corpse condemned to forever relive the pain of having both parents taken before his very eyes you could practically feel that just from looking at pattinson here zoe kravitz nails catwoman as well the relationship between her and the batman is an interesting one they are both on the other side of the law but for different reasons enjoyed these two on screen together the rest of the cast was solid but the movie excels because of these two the atmosphere was phenomenal also you could practically feel gotham as living breathing thing the musical score was on point also and really set the tone of the entire film have no complaints with this movie at all don compare it to other batman movies as it isn the same different writers throughout batmans character arch have had different interpretations of the dark knight was very pleased to see the darker side of batman represented in this movie just great all around1.0\tthe bat and cat duo was very good also loved the cinematography don know if it compares to other batman movies but it definitely deserves this rating1.0\tthe story the background score the performances the action set pieces all are top notch must watch film for bat man fans though the run time is bit let down for me it didnt keep me away its slow burning noir style detective thriller movie the car chase sequence which comes just before the interval is best in recent times the gotham depicted in this movie is gritty dark the batman was film worth awarding five stars couldn fault it it is riveting and raw with magical appeal and an endearing charm don like the genre usually but was so taken aback by the beauty of this film that felt it deserved five stars robert pattinson does some stunning ac perfect batman movie this portrayal of batman is none like we ve ever seen before the iteration of batman is almost too good to be true all the times we ve seen batman in the big screens the greatest detective in the world detective skills has always been under utilised1.0\thad high hopes going into this movie and was little concerned that it wouldn meet those hopes and have to admit after the first hour or so was little shaky particularly when it came to pattinson portrayal of batman and bruce however by the end it all came together love the character arc that bruce batman goes on in this film as it does great job encapsulating the relationship that the caped crusader has with his family and with the city of gotham yeah this movie is darker and grittier than previous iterations that themselves were considered dark and gritty and personally tend to prefer batman stories that are lighter in tone particularly with batman serving as father figure or at least playing role in his family but think it is important to remember that many different people have contributed to the character of batman and thus he has had many different voices over the decades if you want something different then go read watch something else there are so many batman stories out there it is almost impossible for you to have read them all for me as long as the story is good and batman feels right then the tone doesn bother me my only negative for this movie was that the runtime is certainly felt never got bored or lost interest but was defiantly aware of how long the movie had been going and was hoping it would wrap up towards the end1.0\tknew it from the day one that robert will do well and yes he did amazingly well the way matt reaves showed his version of batman is very significant and standout from past versions would definatly like to see joker in next sequels0.0\tthink for me batman is over don want to see more batmans or what so ever everytime there is new movie with new actor trying to give there 100 for the role they are signed up for and wb finishes of one project and goes for another batman now can someone ask wb when they going to drop final version of batman and move on to other movies its like they are addicted to batman or may be they have decided that when people are really getting bored of this concept until then we continue to make batman movie1.0\tthis is batman this is long overdue this might even go down as the best the rest were good but this is batman masterpiece very very well done they ve finally replaced all the high tech bs and cgi everything with acting story and batman watched this alone in my house and almost stood at the credits and clapped bravo bravo so much more realistic and believable so much more the batman than the rest1.0\tthis movie is shot beautifully and uses color lighting and great photography feel like robert pattinson was trying to make batman so serious that it was funny but think the director wanted it to be super serious and that was bit awkward understand why they made it long it was to add suspense but think they over did it overall good but little long and awkward1.0\tcinematography sound design and plot all made this film incredible while do admit it length had me feeling questionable about the film before seeing it was engaged and enjoyed every minute of it 10 10 would see again1.0\trobert pattinson has taken character and owned it this is batman that belongs on the screen one that gives people hope but instills fear in the villains of gotham batman that is flawless detective due to years of training and it showed this batman feels like breath of fresh air and with side cast as memorable as the main character this movie will never go unnoticed on the batman series list1.0\tdark and gritty definitely took me back to the detective comics the actors depicted each character phenomenally and pattinson nailed the batman perfectly on my way to see it again1.0\tmat reeves make the gotham city like real life and robert pattinson as the batman very very awesome this is the best batman ever and the best the batman movie ever swear thanks matt patt zoe and all of you make it happen my dreams batman the greatest detective in the world once more thanks to you matt and crew1.0\trobert pattison is just brillant without saying word he says everything just with his eyes the batman is so different to the dark knight and if you know that see it on the same level0.0\ttrash with so many dc characters hollywood keeps focusing on the one that doesn have any real powers at all worst member of the justice league don waste your money1.0\tdepicted true modern day version of city gone bad and what could happen when leaders lie to you for generation fantastic plot line totally different feel than any previous series the best film have seen in years and top in my lifetime1.0\tthe movie was surprisingly great the villain riddler was amazing in the movie creating many plot twists around the film the movie couldn have been better1.0\tfirst have to start by saying when the song something in my way by nirvana played had goosebumps and it sets the tone for the film batman walking while penguin is upside down is the greatest batman shot ever robert pattinson created history for making batman and bruce wayne the most realistic person who is not only superhero but before that human being who is just like us dark knight is love and the batman is heart period1.0\tmukemmel kanakammajisbzwgnseihdidb merhaba ben de seni cok seviyorum ya da ben mi yanls anladm ki ben de seni cok seviyorum ya da ben mi yanlanladm ki ben de1.0\tmy god even the relatively high critic reviews don do this movie justice went in with high expectations and they were more then satisfied everything other than few nitpicks is perfect the cinematography is 10 10 gotham is gorgeous the acting is disturbingly fantastic the action scenes are taken straight out of the arkham games it masterpiece only short nitpick have is that batman wasn shadowy enough in few scenes he just straight up walks up to places when you expect he enter through window or something also the selina kyle romance was bit rushed but the movie had so much going on can blame it1.0\tloved this movie its tone its characterizations although it was hours long and could have stopped after the first it was gooooooooooooooooood casting of each part spot on great story just great movie but one gripe when he not batman couldn bw comb his hair at least once really that my only complaint about the movie otherwise have given it an 11 if imdb would have let me1.0\trobert pattinson is the only reason this movie isn bad he stole the show as he should but other than that the movie wasn anything special had really high expectations so maybe it my fault still love to see him play batman again though1.0\tthe riddler and the batman paul dano robert pattinson were great and the riddler was great villain and it has potential to have siqual and probably will1.0\toutstanding film in my opinion reeves got the gothic gotham city to pattinson and kravitz chemistry on screen worked perfectly thought andy serkis performance was 10 10 reminded me of sean connery in untouchables where at times he would stead pattinsons character in the right direction lets get the sequal started1.0\texcited good luck with the king speech is fantastic and we are going to bed now need to do to bed now love you too baby girl love you too good to get reason to be mad if can get it to you tomorrow morning to pick up the kids at home and swing by and grab it to you tomorrow morning to pick up the kids at home and swing by and grab it to you tomorrow morning to pick up1.0\tthis new batman is exactly that new it nothing like we have seen before live action elements of all the greatest batman are present within this film from comic books to nolan films to the arkham games to the animated versions at times this film really does feel like you are watching playthrough of the arkham games it got very video game feel to it the action is by far the best out of any batman film it not even close it impressive how well they choreographed and shot the action sequences that being said think the real strength of the batman is the cast farrell kravitz and wright are perfect castings they play their respective roles so well personally they stole the show for me farrell in his limited role as the penguin was hilarious and frightening just as he should be wright as lt gordon has elements of comedy and elements of seriousness his relationship with batman is also just as perfect as it can get but the real show stealer was kravitz as selina kyle say this with complete certainty zoe kravitz is by far the best catwomen ever put on screen she nails the character her voice her action her relationship with batman it all just perfectly done paul dano as the riddler is also really good he is scary but he also got some jim carey goofy riddler vibes to him as well he plays the riddler just like joaquin phoenix played the joker in his film which to most people is probably really good sign personally wish they leaned more into the darker side of the riddler you can see the zodiac vibes but they didn capitalize on that as much as they should ve in my opinion dano riddler was really good but not quite great now of course must talk about pattinson the thing love about his batman is that you clearly are seeing new take on batman this isn bale keaton or any of the other previous caped crusader and thank god for that this is gritty batman but he not murderer like affleck or robot like bale he is gritty but he has some fun too which enjoyed seeing it fresh take on batman that combines the best elements of the ones that came before it pattinson bruce wayne is completely different matter entirely probably my biggest complaint of the movie is pattinson bruce wayne portrayal he nails the batman aspect of the character but his billionaire playboy leaves much to be desired have to give it some credit because it totally different take on the character but frankly pattinson bruce wayne is just bit too depressing get what they re trying to do but if you re going to change the character like that you better do it right and for me it just bit too much the duality of batman bruce wayne is an integral part of the character and you just don see difference between them in this film even with that will say this is definitely my second favorite batman right behind bale as for the movie itself everything is really really good it three hours but it moves fast the riddler plot is great even if the writers hold the audience hand bit too much some elements from comic storylines are cherry picked to create this original story it simple but it works well this movie really is more character based anyway it setting up world and to that end it does its job well there are definitely some rough edges to the story and it doesn quite achieve greatness in my opinion but for the most part it is an intriguing mystery detective narrative that keeps you attached this is not clean cut nolan film yet it holds itself together well enough to keep the audience engaged with all that being said have to say this is not the best batman film not even close maybe not even the second best it sits comfortably in the top three best batman films ever made live action for me personally and while it may not be the best it is probably the most fun out of them all the action humor score and setting of this film create truly unique tone that makes it as enjoyable as any film can be the batman is clearly setting up new batverse and this film does exactly what it was made to do entertain enjoyed every second of it1.0\tthe movie has showed true detective skill of batman which earlier movies didn show on much matt reeves has truely delivered the comic version of batman the movie is package of everything emotional action thriller drama and last of all love chemistry never seen much in any other past movies truely amazing and looking forward for the sequal1.0\tbrilliant villain story and acting lead to perfect batman movie paul dano as the riddler is terrifying and robert pattinson was brilliant batman1.0\tan absolutely beast of movie dark and exiting through out the three hours robert pattinson does excellent job portraying the dark and determent sides og bruce waine you want to get to know and explore both batman as well as bruce waine the film has everything you wish from batman movie enjoy1.0\tvery grown up dark and mysterious version of batman the batmobile was amazing the actors did wonderful job in my opinion go into it with an open mind and expect hours of watch time did really enjoy this film1.0\thero cast bad villain cast very good story and plot very good batman good but bit weak not developed yet as year two bruce wayne not good1.0\tloved everything about it loved the actors story cinematography score and especially the mood for me the best of the series by country mile this sets new standard for movie making in general and for fans of the genre and of the batman1.0\trobert pattinson wow he killed this role along with zoe kravitz paul dano jeffery wright collin farrell just great movie and it great experience1.0\tfirst of let me just say was pleasantly surprised about robbert pattison portrayal of batman when saw that he was cast didn think he fit the role but ve never been more happy to be proven wrong and love to see more of pattinson as batman the cinematography was also top notch better than anything ve seen in long time the design of the suit the sets and the bat mobile we re just awesome now for the bad stuff always enjoy longer movie but they probably could ve cut about 20 30 minutes of content and it would ve improved the film don get me wrong the slow pacing is good but some of the scenes just felt unnecessarily drawn out the writing was good in the first half but the third act didn do it for me1.0\trobert pattinson really plays batman in his unique style he increases his acting skill good hours movie with good story telling suspense the movie hope so goes well in the box office people should recognise good work in future nowadays1.0\tthis is not regular action packed superhero film this is cinema this is an absolute masterpiece and it must watch cinema for not only superhero comic lovers but also all the movie lovers out there1.0\tmatt reeves provides us with another dark and moody batman that can even challenge the dark knight nolan trilogy the surprise casting of pattinson caused major scepticism from many but must say he was surprisingly quite good making bruce dark and mysterious with high profile gotham political figures being murdered under devious plot initiated the riddler the batman will come to terms how his past parents are deeply involved paul dano as the riddler was unbelievable in his role and continues to build solid resume hopefully this is start of new and better dc experience giving marvel run for its money this is without doubt one of the better batman films1.0\twatched the film thought it was pretty and good looked at some enthusiasts point of view looked into who is matt reeves and who he works with watched the movie second time it masterpiece flowless in every way for anything that it represents and it represents so much this movie is so relevant today it has messages and so many things to say and the actors and the roles are truly amazing it was made with true passion and talent the fighting and stunt choreography surpass any of the previous versions and meet any hope and high expectation one could have not going to use in my opinion type of affirmations regarding this aspect or any other topic related to this movie it really is fantastic thank you everyone who worked for making this movie barry keoghan is without doubt perfect for the role1.0\tthis movie introduced robert pattinson batman in the best way possible the acting was perfect the cinematography was beautiful the pacing was unproblematic the action sequences were amazing and the best part was the writing the only reason people rate this at 10 is because they don understand the point of batman batman movie is supposed to be dark and gritty not family friendly 100 recommend1.0\tmatt reeves the batman is definitely the darkest version of the character that we ve seen on the big screen know big complaint that many people seem to have with dc live action films vs the mcu is how dark and kinda depressing however dark does not equal bad it all in the execution abd happy to say that the execution here with the batman is terrific also another thing love about this film is something that loved about nolan the dark knight which is that those two films are far more grounded in reality than any other live action versions of batman there are of course some exceptions but the batman feels like something that could be possible as opposed to just feeling like it comic book goofiness the riddler in this film was transformed from campy strange nuisance to downright scary dark mysterious intelligent and most of all very dangerous criminal we don get very much bruce wayne in this film as here he known to be recluse rather than the playboy going out with multiple women at time that we re used to seeing imagine he will become that version of bruce wayne later on in the sequels also love the amount of detective work that batman is required to do in this one feel like we never got to see much of that even though he commonly referred to as the world greatest detective in closing know that lot of people seem to just ask is it better or worse than the dark knight and honestly they are very difficult movies to compare as tdk was an action packed blockbuster where this is mystery noir type film of course everyone will have their own preference but all can say is this movie is fantastic and think it great way to portray the characters0.0\tnot the best choice for batman and because it is batman movie and kids might be there entirely too much cussing especially the word they have the men in blue being way too simple1.0\twell um big fan of batman series christian bale was the best so far but after him robert he has done it so well just last night the dark theme suits him so well that um his fan nw the intense look was so well picturized and for the first time batman was not supportn his family legacy but was absconder in the start keep up the good work both the director and robert0.0\tto think we could have gotten ben affleck batman going up against deathstroke would have settled for short film about that than this dumpster fire we didn need another gritty small time batman movie this is not how you compete with marvel colin farrell penguin while not huge part of the film was actually pretty entertaining but he just your typical slimy mobster1.0\tnot superhero fan of any kind in fact this was my first batman movie but rather enjoyed it it seemed unnecessarily lengthy coming in at about 2hrs45 but it was full of action still found it hard to get into as such but it was good introduction to the franchise1.0\trp was great choice for dark take on the dark knight impeccable casting and an all round great film really hoping for sequel to this new era of batman0.0\twalked out through for several reasons filmed way too physically dark hard to catch all the action too dark also in story line batman must have been on downers hardly speaks and when he does hard to understand the dark circles around eyes need to go maybe he needs shot of 12 barely any action kept waiting for anything exciting to happen finally could not take it anymore why do filmmakers ruin good thing1.0\tand robbbb have get osccar for movie because best movie batman all the time and like zoe keravitz catwoman she intersting catwoman and thank you matt you best and thank you all of you for movie1.0\tliked it better than the 90 movies rob patt played an awesome batman if you are batman fan you will love it the way the batman is as person is phenomenal1.0\tit great movie only complaint could make is it tad dark on the lighting side in the theater that no big deal but when it comes to streaming and wanna watch it again the house better be pitch black gives me serious seven vibes also in rogue one when vader shows up in the hall way scene got that same feeling of holy sh this is epic in the batman every time he came out of dark corner those moments really landed for me loved it1.0\tthis batman movie is truly work of art the audience can feel that the production crew and everyone involved put their heart and soul into this movie however paul dano spectacular acting stood out from everyone else and perhaps make him one of the most reputable villain in both the dccu and of all time in the future1.0\tcinematography amazing just had problem of how dark it was and when suddenly strong light will get me blind ost going to binge the tf of it for the next weeks sound effect the sound waves penetrated my body it was so good plot twists bruh thought the movie ended times at certain events and it didn lol they covered almost each character development well paul dano definitely done an amazing job as riddleman villain that will be remembered and so is the rest of the characters ll give it very rare 10 because of how rediculiously dark and some characters holes definitely worth it1.0\tbatman movie that can be closely placed to the comic books gotham city portrayal us awesome dark and gritty the entire cast is insync with their characters lived up to the hype1.0\tthe batman much better than expected pattinson did good job some thought he was type cast from earlier movies that he has done but pattinson has made quite few interesting films refreshing that he was not some hyped up muscle bound character through surgery or other ways he is in good shape though and very relatable the score was one of the most impressive things in the films yea there was one or ridiculous politically correct lines in the entire film but that is just to impress the studio heads to get funding overall the story was fine in many ways mystery this is certainly by far the most likable bruce wayne fine character development and solid action1.0\tthis batman is epic the city of gotham is more to real city than any batman movie to date it has historical inner city but the actual city is modern batman does not have any fancy over the top gadgets but things that normal adrenal junkie would use so this makes him more realistic imo the riddler is nobody yet he is somebody he is anybody he has superior deviant mind but outside of that he is just like you and so he makes the perfect villain his plans are fantastic and his riddle though not overly difficult but challenging he kills and does it well this is his story and the writes have done an excellent job compared to all the other movies to date this is 10 because see that it could happen terrorist strike now there is some whatever moments but that never detracts from the movie say watch it but have an empty bladder for it is hours long and you do not want to miss this non stop action detective comics movie1.0\tthis film is brilliant the cast are spot on pattinson is great batman with wright being probably the best gordon we have seen on screen and he had some really big boots to fill let be honest kravitz is great dano is disturbing and farrell well you forget it him his deniro inspired take on the penguin is brilliant love the look of gotham the story and how see bruce wayne before he develops the persona we all know and love the only people that seem to dislike this film are dark knight fan boys time change respect the past and embrace the future and the future of batman looks great to me0.0\tfilled with cliches absolute garbage so so so boring very mediocre acting but don blame the actors if they were gonna make this bad of movie the least they could do is not make it so long1.0\tthis review will not contain spoilers for the batman truly don even know where to start guess shall begin with the soundtrack michael giacchino really blew it out of the water in this movie he done other films like jurassic world and dune and this score is definitely as brilliant as both of those other soundtracks michael has always done phenomenal job and this may be better than dune soundtrack which was absolutely stunning definitely my new favorite soundtrack ll be listening on spotify second the plot was really really thoughtful and amazing the idea of corruption in dirty city like gotham and what can arise from this scenario is just beautiful the plot has so many unique elements to it that really captivate the audience it very gritty grounded storyline that you really have to pay attention to if you don you will be lost for the rest of the film there so much to learn from this film and lot of time was spent on creating this storyline clearly the characters are thoroughly developed throughout this masterpiece of film no these are not cardboard cutouts they each have their own personal issues and backgrounds there is always twist or turn with these characters and they feel like real characters living in our world each of them has their own sort of subplot within the film and you are always learning more about them the main antagonist of the film edward nashton the riddler is very horror like zodiac killer however he maintains his wackiness throughout the film paul dano truly does great job in playing this complex character the first time we see nashton on screen is absolutely terrifying won go into detail but the riddler is very brutal sadistic and eccentric in this film he is more of an overarching antagonist but his presence is very much felt great job paul dano bruce wayne the batman is very detailed and complex character he wants to strike fear into the criminals of gotham but also must deal with his own issues he struggles playing two faced character in the world of gotham and is reclusive he mainly wants to live in the world of the batman but also uncovers some interesting history about the wayne family which forces him to look back into the past he doesn want to great character development here as well nailed it robert pattinson overall this is slow drama action and crime film similar in the likes of se7en and zodiac everything is thought through with this film and have absolutely no complaints however if you want crazy non stop action easily understood batman film this is definitely not the choice for you for me and the rest of the batman fanbase this is one of the best movies of 2022 and it only march1.0\tthis movie is up there with my favorite movies ever but think the new take on batman in film setting is marvelous understand the criticism of pattinson bruce being very emo but like that they don go down the playboy route and focused more on who he is as batman his actions and what he says throughout the movie reinforce that he is more batman then bruce there too many things that the movie nails for me to point out just go see it1.0\tthis movie shows what batman supposed to be dark wounded cool detective hated everything about batfleck loved everything about battinson this is not marvel dont try to be0.0\tgreat cinematics but atrocious acting and predictable and droll storyline could have ended like 10 times at better point in the story but it persisted1.0\tfrom the perspective of someone studying film really love how the director was open about how he drew inspiration from films like taxi driver chinatown seven and zodiac and showed elements of those films in this movie like he was paying homage to them the pacing was great for the type of film this was aiming to be which was detective noir genre however can understand and will not challenge why some audiences feel some scenes felt long and could ve been tightened greg fraser has done it again his cinematography for this film was top tier every shot was so beautifully framed without taking away from the story which is something lot of film makers have challenges with greg also shot and is nominated for his work on dune michael giacchino score was absolutely incredible and was used perfectly for what each scene required it came in strong when it needed to and introduced haunting elements tastefully when the film was heading in that specific direction michael has an extensive portfolio where he has also composed for lot of other big budget films spider man no way home being just one of them casting was perfect the lead and supporting cast definitely held their own may even agree with some that the supporting cast performance may have overshadowed robert pattinson that with him still delivering fantastic and possibly one of my favourite batman performances of all time do agree with critics that the third act felt different from the first two but after reviewing it within the entire context of the film believe it was required to show the full character arc of batman as batman fan absolutely ecstatic with this film and it is dream come true that we finally got this depiction of the character for live action adaptation huge thank you to matt reeves the cast and crew for this great work of art that is the batman1.0\tjust amazing it more than anything you ask for in batman film pattinskn was great kravits was great wright was an amazing jim gordan and dano as riddler was freakishly terrifying1.0\thonestly the best batman series ever and also the darkest intense from the beginning till the end especially the theme music totally matched everything in the movie that the batman we have been waiting for must watch1.0\twas apprehensive given the reviews but really liked it wasn gone on the climax but it that sort of movie colin farrell was something else didn recognise him at all0.0\tcan someone please explain to me how this is batman movie no proper batmobile no real batman action not real story no real villain what is this they have tried to copy dark knight but failed terribly1.0\trobert pattinson was the most excellent actor love the acting of robert pattinson and good choice of directors to choose robert pattinson movie was much good but movie was too long0.0\tthis movie lacked any meaningful super hero movie qualities or action this was like csi meets halloween bat mobile chase scene terribly boring with ridiculous ending and cut scene ending action scene had to be written by someone with senses of direction was waiting batman to call for aquaman or say something ridiculous like shazam this movie was the worst1.0\tas someone who is comics fan really loved this movie and would recommend everyone the movie mainly focuses bruce wayne as batman as his original personality rather than bruce wayne as playboy anyways he is batman most of the time really like catwoman zoe is hot and did amazing job playing it thought the villane was the weak part of this film because they trued to make him seem like joker from dark knight in fact the weakest part of the movie was the ending which was similar to dark knight but anyways am letting it slide because really loved everything else pattinson is perfect as batman reminded of new 521.0\tbest actions best fight scenes the art the style perfect truly detective solving crime contrast between bad guy and hero is beautiful best bat and cat power couple1.0\tthis movie is amazing from the cinematography to the music to the action to the acting but most important the story was the big thing of the film it really felt like story film and not just an event like mcu has done with their films it feels like fincher thriller horror film robert pattison as batman might be you favourite batman bruce wayne he is amazing every time he on screen can feel his emotion paul dano might be below heath ledger joker paul dano wad scary asf he was menace the whole film the things he does might scare you he was full on menace yes you should definitely watch this film it gives everything wanted as batman flick it pure cinema 10 10 well deserved matt reeves literally saved comic book movies1.0\twow it top tier batman and top tier superhero movie let start off with the nitpicks pattinson voice was abit too whispery to point where couldn understand him at times the narration at the end felt kinda unnecessary wished we had more alfred riddler and penguin throughout the runtime pros the fight scenes were clear and well choreographed none on the level of the bvs warehouse fight but it got the job done most of the characters feel fleshed out selina and riddler stand out paul dano was insane batman bruce have great arc about vengeance and turning it into justice and hope and pattinson conveys that perfectly love all the detective stuff batman and selina work well with good chemistry wished we had more moments with them jeffrey wright and john turturro were good in their roles this movie is so smartly woven also the soundtrack is fire and so is the batmobile wished we had more of it need to rewatch asap1.0\tthe theme in this film is all about bob kane detective story apart from being an expert in ninjitsu batman is brilliant detective and this feature explores that am not sure about the portrayal of carmine falcone but john turturro plays the roman nicely wanted the marones in this but we can all have our cake and eat it as for reeves directing am not sure if fincher is happy with his films fight club se7en zodiac playing subthemes not great batman film but certainly up there with the best1.0\tll keep it short it dark and gloomy and you won walk away feeling warm and fuzzy but it will stay with you and that good thing enjoyed pattinson in this role not my favorite batman but he acted it well this film was beautiful the use of light was brilliant go see it in theaters if you enjoy dc you won be disappointed1.0\tfantastic cinematography throughout the movie there weren many dull moments it exceeded my expectations as went in thinking it yet another batman movie but was pleasantly surprised at how captivating the whole thing was matt reeves certainly did good job on this one you won be disappointed with detective batman1.0\twas solidly entertained for all hours clever gritty character fillled it not quite as sophisticated as the dark knight rises but it enthralling all the same top quality acting from an absolutely fantastic cast hope we see more of the riddler paul dano is something special the mystery detective element was very enjoyable not super hero movie fan but the recent batman and spider man are just all round fabulous films negatives last minutes were pretty blah and prior to that it was getting bit over sentimental the old fashioned batman knows best dynamic btw batman and catwoman is pretty dated and actually just bit creepy batman seems vverrryyyy good at solving riddles verdict how lucky to pay for ticket and get hours of super filmmaking rare thing1.0\tdirected by matt reeves the batman is narrative driven detective film that breaks the tropes of what superhero movies have been the past few years but more importantly for the most part it breaks the tropes of what we expect from batman film robert pattinson picks up the cowl and really makes something special with his performance as the caped crusader and also as bruce wayne this is different kind of bruce not the eccentric double life kind we have seen in most film adaptions instead bruce who has been consumed by his alter ego of batman the lines have been blurred and it seems to no longer matter if he wearing the cowl or not really enjoyed how heavily this fits into the narrative and the story presented the batman is neo noir detective drama more so than it is batman movie it has different approach than the previous entries that have come before it even if yes it sometimes explores similar themes as result of this approach it one of the best comic book films ve seen and by far one of the best batman films to date highly recommend this film to not only batman fans but to mystery or crime drama fans in general there more want to say but this movie works better the less you know so go see it will be seeing it again and posting follow up article to discuss the future of this series and more of my thoughts that will contain spoilers1.0\tpersonal all time favourite amazing from casting performances artistic choices and the wonderful score by michael giacchino additionally performance by jeffrey wright more than exceeded an already high expectation robert pattinson was superb collin ferrel the penguin was an absolute delight zoe kravitz additionally was more than exceptional selina kyle catwoman the cast overall showed great chemistry and this movie does not fail to entertain0.0\tit not entirely bad it just average kind of boring at times only good thing nirvana something in the way it worth mentioning robert played good batman it not the best but either the worst and catwoman awful1.0\tdarker than expected but it added to the suspense and intrigue liked the ending scene right before the credits also the batman combo for pocorn slushee was too goated1.0\tmust admit was thinking patts as batman dear and not another bloody catwoman but bloody loved this film every character was great zoe kravitz is my new favourite catwoman absolutely brilliant0.0\tfor me christian bale will always be the best batman and health ledger will be the best villain the movie was shot in very dark light and the villain was cought without any hassle disappointed1.0\tthe cast is as perfect as it can be my only complaint is that wanted more paul dino but this film still blew expectations and delivered killer gritty masterpiece sit back and enjoy pure cinema this is as close as it can get for cbm1.0\tmatt reeves his team and the cast would have known from the very beginning the enormity almost futile of the challenge they had taken up the gauntlet they had picked up would be almost too heavy to lift for the weight of nostalgia alone if nothing else the ghost of the brilliant nolan trilogy would always loom at the back of the mind and the batman universe now has unsaid rules which you can thwart if you are to be taken seriously humour can be deployed only sparingly any romantic interest will be scoffed at and the most difficult task the portrayal of villains over his trilogy nolan covered the bad guy spectrum from the psychological via the maniacal to the brutal the concluding piece even baked in social commentary and contemporary global events what left to be said in batman movie in few decades is hard to figure yet reeves with his opening salvo comes out with his reputation enhanced he chooses to switch lanes swerving the batman universe to noir crime drama setting in terms of sights sounds and storytelling the ambience is shorn of light both literally and figuratively the flow is that of serial killer murder mystery the characters are shady their motives as hard to decipher as they themselves are in the scantily lit frames but it is the soundscape that comes swooping down to the rescue time and again the sucker punch opening score clever choice to sidestep comparisons with opening scenes of tdk tdkr as well as bond ventures of the last decade that these may or may not have influenced the riveting dramatic scores enhancing the action sequences particularly enjoyed the beats as penguin car knocks down the traffic cones during the chase at the halfway stage and the brooding soundscape that builds the atmosphere of this intense tale all contribute to paint the picture of city clouded by fear plagued by corruption on tenterhooks robert pattinson has proved competent in an array of roles in the recent past the lighthouse the devil all the time tenet come to mind and continues the good work here conveying eloquently with his eyes to make this another solid outing personally though would have liked deeper dive into what drives bruce and what he feels the voiceovers are nearly not enough to unpack what drives the man perhaps in the next installment jeffrey wright and andy serkis perform their parts adequately zoe kravitz makes selina kyle her own albeit constrained in an underwritten character paul dano delivers in the limited opportunities he gets the monologue that provides an insight into riddler psyche being the high point the film hurts from peaking early as the stupendous chase setpiece raises the expectation of another such act that the final hour does not deliver however this reboot might be channeling its ambitions in different track choosing to lend validity and meaning to the fantastic tale of an industry heir who moonlights as vigilante with kind heart masked in an iron glove the focus might be more on the the relevance of the fable seen in the light of contemporary world values than debate on the mechanics of the batsuit batmobile or the intricate details of terrorist plots however it the details like the wordplay and the blink and you miss it nods the penguin like gait of the tied oswald make it rewarding watch the batman 2022 thus ends up being starter that whets the appetite but as of now an incomplete painting that can only be judged once the main course is savoured1.0\tan original and violent batman film seriously scary riddler colin farell take on the penguin is very wiseguy if he wasn in gotham he be in goodfellas fuhgeddaboudit this is very entertaining film and look forward to the next installment okay peace out1.0\tcan even put into words how much loved the film may be biased because huge batman fan but this is everything ever wanted many criticized the length of the movie however think it perfect the movie really needed this run time and there not single scene in there that is unnecessary batman goes through character arc and growth like ve never seen in batman movie before robert pattinson is absolutely amazing in the role he can portray every emotion there is with only his eyes and brings such refreshing depth and humanness to the character paul dano performance was obviously very captivating and scary zoe kravitz and jeffrey wright also bring their game and potray the characters in such different but interesting way the tone is depressing and that is perfect batmn was always dark and gritty character so this was needed addition the detective noir aspect was beautifully done the suspense was amazing and the riddles and plot twists were pretty clever lastly the action was very good must say there were couple of scenes were the cgi wasn all that good and the goons that are being beaten by batman don react enough while waiting for punch but overall it was very solid1.0\tthe batman was the best ve ever seen was skeptical about rp in this role but he was awesome the whole movie felt right not bad thing can say about it must see1.0\tthis movie is very different from all the batman movies before it it rarely had scene in daylight it slow paced it very good detective story it was delight and had some of the best cinematography ve seen1.0\timbd doesn allow decimal points ratings if they did have given this an instead of an the casting was amazing the only exceptions have would be that andy serkis while an amazing actor didn feel like an authentic alfred and colin farell was unrecognizable everyone else was so damn good in their roles almost hours is very long run time but the characters where well written enough that it all felt very warranted at times the cinematography felt like it had too dark of lighting get that it supposed to be dark it batman movie and batman fights criminals at night it was just little too much at times overall the film is really really good the few minor criticisms would have are minor the film as whole is really very good just hope that when they make the eventual sequel that it isn some phoned in money making ploy and that they actually try and tell good story1.0\t1989 batman is really special for me but this is something different it is epic and has an absolute power don want to write about details or things that did not like just want to say this is the best batman movie ever great job thank you matt reeves1.0\tthe batman is more realistic than super hero movie if you are batman fan you might not like but others become fan after watching this movie cinematography bgm direction overall marvelous worth watching in the theatre1.0\tsuperb filmmaking love that the film dispenses with that lame fetish of wealth as superpower it leads us back to character as the batman key trait and not moment too soon inspired writing for film rebooted so many times terrific choice is the attempt to find in the rank and file police both universal distrust of batman as meddler in police business and attempts to avoid caricaturing police as monolithic brotherhood instead one of mixed motives unpredictable and that that may not be unified not new but so much more believable the narrative is unpeeled slowly and it makes the pleasure of watching feel more like binge watching carefully crafted mini series found myself delighting in the slow reveal and sincerely enjoying how well the movie was made so much of the techno glitz of the nolan films is gone as is the gothic operatic design excesses of burton legacy in fact it harkens closer to the stripped bare joker here every larger is unpredictable you feel that like batman over cranked car his character is not quite in his control loved the characters and how they were portrayed batman was solidly held in robert pattinson portrayal and his physicality was also not made foolishly superhuman but more realistic gordon was played with firm in non flashy resolve by jeffrey white and zoe kravitz was perfect as gritty damaged and driven paul dano was truly inspired choice and out spacey kevin spacey as se7en like villain after seeing the film knowing that colin farrell was the penguin still fails to compute he literally vanished into that role my one thought concerns the roundup at the end it seemed like there was so much story left to tell with the same conviction and skill but it wasn quite there for me the film prepped us for it so that was surprise small note in massive hammer crash of film supremely enjoyable0.0\timagine film noir detective movie but instead of trench coat and hat he got batman suit on the uninspired and predictable twists and turns of the mystery take three times as long to unravel as they should the film is anchored by lead with zero charisma whose most badass moment is in the trailer the hype around this film seems to come from total commitment to love it despite its obvious mediocrity1.0\tdecent movie with decent cast good to see them focusing on the detective side of batman rather than just fighting bad guys batman is detective after all don think they should have went full zodiac though paul dano who plays the riddler was ok they shouldn have distorted his voice for 10ths of the movie he sounded like bane the worst part of this movie was the joker tease in arkham at the end no way should barry keoghan or whatever his name is play the joker the kid can hardly open his eyes1.0\tcan really put into words how much loved the batman it exceeded my expectations and more the gotham city we see is the darkest and most grittiest take we ve seen on the big screen and it made me want more of gotham which hopefully we will get in the sequels to come fingers crossed robert pattinson brings different side of batman that we haven seen before when he partners up with jim gordon jeffrey wright and plays more detective role like everyone was bit sheepish at first when heard pattinson had been cast but warner bros made the right decision in the end as found him to be freakingly terrifying at times the chemistry on screen with catwoman zoë kravitz was extraordinarily passionate and think her performance as catwoman is the best we have gotten knew the film was going to have much darker tone in the first 10 minutes when we saw the truly horrifying riddler paul dano other standout performances in the film are the penguin colin farrell carmine falcone john turturro and alfred andy serkis the bar has been set so high by the whole cast can wait to see what they can do in the future finally along with matt reeves the other person who brought the whole film together is michael giacchino with his truly magnificent score can seem to get the batman theme out my head and find myself occasionally humming it to myself the batman is arguably the best comic book movie we ve ever seen and true rival to the dark knight 2008 think after multiple viewings of this film we ll still be finding new things within it can wait to see it again already vengeance1.0\teverything about this film is great from action to small details everything is top notch must watch it great dc film since tdk would say it tdk quality movie first off acting is great robert pattinson was perfect as batman and so was zoe kravitz as catwoman and everyone did their job quite well cinematography was superb the best in dc movies would say conclusion it must watch movie of 20221.0\twatched on 11 mar 2022 at pvr mangalore india do not miss this superlative super hero detective noir movie in theatre unique haunting bgm super dark yet outstanding cinematography never seen before lighting long slow burn yet tight screenplay thrilling intriguing sequences engaging mysterious storyline immersive experience realistic acting by all characters terrifying actions emotions no glam sham only raw content above all top notch work from director matt reeves and best acting by our the batman robert pattinson all cine buffs including directors should watch this exceptional inspirational case study movie1.0\tdie hard marvel fan to the core like dc when it good sorry snyder is not good this was great you did not feel the run time at all the music by giachino incorporating both ave maria and the nirvana song into its being was amazing this is batman movie batman is the star not bruce wayne not the villains it is also so refreshing and welcome to see the batman working alongside the police and not working with them trying to catch him so done with that plot device of batman being treated like villain the relationship is tenuous but still glad batman isn seen as villain too for once he detective and works to solve the crimes that are being committed matt reeves an obvious fan of christine delivers an awesome intro for the batmobile batman is early in his career he fallible he gets knocked down he feels pain my only very minor quibbles are an early death scene thought felt couple of beats too short for the flow of the rest of the scene rating and tag at the end of the film was wholly unnecessary and seemed to be there only for studio purposes the audience didn need that service not even the batman fans we got enough but wow loved it recommend it to any batman fan go see it now0.0\ttoo long too boring and the worst batman movie ever made deserve their razzie awards 2022 2023 and forever needs gets his own category bsbehehd hebdhdu hbssbehd habsburg1.0\tthis movie is fantastic for all fans of the nohlan triloge there movie look awesome there has style that look like film noir there is dark gloomy detective story and love it must see for all batman fans1.0\twow matt reeves robert pattinson and company have delivered the absolute perfect batman experience in the cinemas taking elements of the nolan burton films and the arkham games bundled together with fragments of comic book giants like the long halloween director matt reeves has crafted tense epic batman tale pattinson slays the role totally obliterating any naysayers kravitz gives layered performance as catwoman too the best portrayal of the character since 1992 batman returns by michelle pfeiffer colin farrell is so unrecognizable as the penguin and does such great job paul dano riddler is terrifying and such fresh interesting take on the iconic batman villain bottom line the cast is perfect all across the board could rant for hours and use countless paragraphs to express my love for this film such perfect batman film perfect film experience period1.0\thours wouldn have been too long if it wasn for the annoying overuse of flares there were also some awkward scenes but overall the movie was worth watching1.0\twant to post this review while fresh out of seeing this not trying to dissect the film and make it an essay im going to give my honest take on film ve waited so long to see since it was announced among many there are few points believe are important heading into viewing yeah it long hours please stop comparing totally different take enjoy it for what it is different while it not perfect it is both loyal and consistent to the style tone and theme that it wanted went in hoping for watered down take of what david fincher and trent reznor would do with an rating and it was pretty close for pg13 matt reeves did great with pg13 rating everyone played their roles well but think this movie could be huge in showing viewers who are unfamiliar with certain actors just how good they are this could be standalone film if it wants to be matt reeves knows how to stretch story and build trilogy for those who haven seen the planet of the apes trilogy most of my friends don but they re dumb the batman is in good hands for lot of reasons1.0\tall the shots are actually feels real yeah the movie go slowly but we saw the actual batman after long time great work by matt reeves but dark knight is dark knight hope matt reeves next time gives the batman movie who breaks the dark knight trilogy think its the great movie little dark and the batman fighting scenes are awesome1.0\tmatt reeves took this famous superhero into whole new level where it more gritty darker more realistic and more grounded robert pattison portrayal as bruce wayne and batman was phenomenal and his performance was excellent who we see him as broken man or this vicious angry vigilante who is trying to figure out on how to save gotham city in the right way and matt reeves makes us care about the city that the hero is trying to save also zoe kravitz portrayal as selina kyle or catwoman was great and think she is the best catwoman that we ve got so far matt reeves also gave us detective story that the character deserves where we see batman and jim gordon working together on solving the riddles the action was thrilling grounded and exciting to look at they made the fight scene look super realistic and very well choreographed this is one of the most realistic batman movie since the dark knight the only problem that had with the movie is that got little dissapointed that we only get to see face to face bewteen batman and the riddler for few times and he didn appear in the third act still the riddler is an awesome live action batman villain verdict 101.0\tmusical score is perfect practical effects perfect colour grading and locations perfect cinematography absolute perfection but is the batman perfect cbm movie bit skeptical about that the problem with the batman is over exposition there were some places where literally felt that reeves should have spent some time on characters like pengin and falcone instead of some lengthy unwanted scenes the interrogation scene in the third act literally changes or should say ruins everything that it built in the first two acts it really good and different take on the batman but there has been constant talk if the batman is better than the dark knight but in my opinion it does not but matt reeves promises grounded and more realistic version of the batman that drags some times1.0\treview for thebatman no spoiler the movie focuses on detective side of batman which is 1st time to see on live screen fighting was very good but there was repetitive shooting at protective costume bullet proof vest 1st time to see wide gotham city jeferry wright commissioner gordon performance was excellent colin pharrell penguin was amazing and funny the ice loung boss some details were taken from gotham tv series andy serkis alfred was not convincing and did not have much screening time pattison batman was great and amazing but as bruce wayne was awful and grumpy he appears as freak and introvert unlike all other previous bruce wayne performance selina kyel was moderate and there was no enough introduction to her background see this is the most batman movie closer to reality and out current world the 1st hours were interesting but last hour was boring and the last fighting scene was full of mistakes rate 101.0\tclinging onto my seats tension and mystery are far out unexpectedly this adaptation is everything you want support this audition it legacy and future of the heavily inspiring comic book character batman1.0\tnoah this is one of the essence of the batman it reminds me exclusively from seven the movie grows step by step as the riddles are solved robert pattinson work is flawless just go watch you won regret after all promise you are gonna have some great time and experience unbelievable scenes believe me it impeccable movie0.0\tit wasn bad movie that would be star like being able to see my movies and at least 75 was in the dark as well this movie never seemed to end originally wanted to leave halfway through but my wife didn want to waste money also didn have many fighting scenes was rather bored1.0\trobert pattinson just nailed in role of batman and this movie is really amazing in theatre listen so many people are laughing just want to say them if you just like glamourous movies do go to waste ch batman because you guys dont deserve the true beauty of this genre1.0\ttoo long too dark too much voice over too much dramatic moodiness not enough car not enough water disappointing riddler great penguin nice cat but mostly just too much wannabe dark and moody and boring1.0\tpeople on here have said that this was too long and boring didn find it to be either of those things but did think the story was far to light for the playing time robert is actually pretty good but doesn really have much to do apart from stare at things and talk in low raspy voice zoe is really interesting actress but she miscast here was hoping she might crack stupid joke or laugh at something but that was not to be she 24 hour vigilante and don you forget it unfortunately she very petite and it just doesn ring true that she be able to do all the fighting that she does the riddler is really repugnant incel type character but for some reason it just doesn seem to work not sure why the arthouse approach to the production would work better if the actors had chemistry and presence but they just don out of all of them say zoe has the most screen presence mainly because she actually given something to do and has few fashionable costume changes as for the others they almost look like part of the scenery as everything is muted and dark including the costumes everything just blends together after while all in all it an interesting dud would be almost unwatchable on the small screen so see it on the big screen of you can1.0\twho would of thought if you wanna compete with the nolan trilogy all you would have to do is just go darker thats exactly what reeves did here and it works really really well think this is great start to reeves trilogy even believe this one beats out nolan batman begins1.0\tmatt reeves gives us the film noir and true detective story that batman deserves so deep so dark with amazing story arc journey for batman and catwoman with sadistic crazy riddler cinematography and soundtrack were mind blowing they play vital role that immerses you in the dark courrupt world of gotham this movie will take his place as one of the best film noirs in history1.0\tnearly hours long and very slowly pacedbeing of an age to have known the history of batman portrayal the main failing in this iteration is lack of imagination or originality it rehash of past themes in either the movie or tv cartoon versions of batman even the noir atmosphere mimicked that of the original bladerunner neither the costumes not the arc of the romance between the bat and cat girl nor the special effects had any novelty just more of the same but more slowly without much facial expression or character development it truly was cartoon brought to screen the good decent acting by secondary characters even though the charismatic andy serkis was only given short minor scenes most of the others were competent to good the most ambitious special effect was the flooding of manhattan and the car chase on the freeway in the wrong langes but we ve seen as good or better the bad casting of lead robert pattinson is pasty skinned gangly englishman you almost never see him out of costume so his acting is limited to his eyes and monotone put on hoarse midwest voice the indifferent the junior kravitz just seemed too green the indifferent implausibilities from live electrical wires sent into standing water with no electrocution none of the baddies had any dimensionality but simply one note cartoon characters1.0\tthis is great take on batman the movie pulls influence from the long halloween and seven making it real great detective story the three hour movie flew by not realizing how long it actually is1.0\tam big fan of the nolan franchise so was expecting this to not live up to what already know and love whilst this didn fully reach the depths of the nolan trilogy it certainly packs punch did enjoy it dark and gloomy tone all the way through and enjoyed it being crime mystery movie it didn feel like batman movie in my opinion which is neither good nor bad felt it was slightly too long and could have easily been cut down by half an hour some scenes seem to drag on bit with not much going on pattinson does good job as batman although not convinced on his bruce wayne paul dano is great casting in the role of the riddler as he brings creepy unhinged psychotic portrayal to the character overall an enjoyable film which takes on different tone to other batman movies1.0\tover the years we have had many dark knights keaton bale affeleck to name few some people have had their doubts regarding pattinson batman boy oh boy are they wrong complete new rendition of the caped crusader excellent excellent cinematography and the story line was nearly perfect dark gritty and chaotic batman that we ve all wanted for years with perfect villaian synergy this movie is definitely in par with the likes of the dark knight and batman begins although have to say for me as movie dark knight is as close as it gets to being perfect this matt reeves rendition is almost as good as that one todd phillips joker and matt reeves batman are better off left alone as stand alones if they try to make it into some universe like marvel it is going to get messed up1.0\tmatt reeves obviously loves frank miller portrait of young batman it is stunning how iconic this movie feels and looks this is the dc comics in its true prominent form the city of gotham feels like perfect balance of tim burton twisted gothic architecture and christopher nolan realism each character is brought on screen with immense amount of care and understanding even if they do not look exactly like their comic book predecessors gordon alfred their overall portrayal and mindset is true to the original characters the movie starts instantly in its first seconds and it does not bother explaining what is what and who is who it is primarily detective tale which we did not seen that much in live action although batman is not yet the world greatest detective we can see his tough journey of slowly becoming one overall everyone who worked on this film did great job the amount of atmosphere is just perfect the music is beautiful daunting and epic along with the tremendous camera the batman did not surpass the mask of the phantasm or the dark knight but it is damn close1.0\tstraight up masterpiece this film is gritty and unapologetic patterson does fantastic job as our new batman we get to see what an unpolished batman is like he makes mistakes he gets hurt and he unsure of the direction he wants to go all supporting cast is played equally as well by their actors not sure which one like more the dark knight or this they just may both be equally as great patterson is hands down better batman than christian bale my only hope is that we get trilogy out of this so we can see batman grow1.0\tthe most cinema movie of all batman movies matt reeves directing skills are just mindblowing adding the beatiful cinematography it nearly close to perfection the actors here are fantastic in special robert pattinson and the incredible paul dano1.0\tover all this movie exceeded my expectations by long shot was expecting more in tune of the last batman movies after nolan which says didn have high hopes to say that it exceeded by long shot it came close in my honest opinion to challenging the nolan dark knight series in terms of keeping you in your seats when say close mean really close as plan on watching it again the only reason it not 10 is not because of the comparison to the dark knight series but because at times it just felt little drawn out twice found myself wondering how long are we into the movie and how much to go believe movie no matter how good the rest is shouldn have moments that lead up to that thinking1.0\tdid not see any trailers spoilers before and was stunned by the job reeves had done loved the script which missed in dc for long time and loved the motions expressions and behavior of this batman pattinson did great job for me that was important to fall in love with batman once again since the last one kind of spoiled that from me loved the emotions he had in all the fight scenes he might even become my favorite batman the story was fascinating but politics as usual gave me the feel of gotham and am super excited to see the joker in this series the only thing was that some scenes could have been more dramatic like the bond between batman and the little boy or some encounters with falcone who played major role in this movie if they only let the camera roll just one or two seconds more in those scenes loved most characters everyone did an amazing job with the acting but there was not one who crazily stood out like heath ledger christian bale or joaqin in joker that is for me the biggest difference with the dark night and joker but love that batman was the focus in this movie that also made me love the title of the movie more way above my expectations am so so so glad with this movie1.0\trobert performance is better than what have expected even the show it bit too long it is still enjoyable and makes you goosebumps in some scene this is one of the best batman out there1.0\tuna película seria oscura una verdadera obra de arte es todo lo que quería ver en una película de batman además cuenta con un excelente reparto actuaciones la altura en resumen para mi la mejor película de superheroes que visto aunque no se si llamarla película de superheroes porque esto es mucho mejor1.0\tam huge batman fan and matt reeves impressed me with his ambitious apes films so had high expectations here was not disappointed no batman film has ever looked this stunning firstly the man himself this is the best cinema batsuit ever sharp sleek compared to the recent more built beefy look the mask especially is perfect robert pattinson bright eyes are working overtime and the black makeup usually comedic afterthought has been turned into an asset the controversy around his casting is long forgotten he is an outstanding batman more astonishing cinematography from greig fraser who builds on last years dune to cement himself as the best dp working today gotham feels more menacing and atmospheric than ever in almost eternal night and endless rain only the beautiful panoramic rooftops offer an escape from the hell below special mention to car chase like no other the speed and danger of the batmobile felt viscerally real magnificently wrathful score is another high point this film is technical marvel and how impressive that they achieved this against the disruptions of pandemic it wonderful to finally see batman in his role as worlds greatest detective in proper noir the film would still be fantastic even if it was removed from any batman context following riddler clues and piecing together the mystery was thrilling cannot wait to experience it again what chilling and original take on the riddler radical change from previous camp portrayals from the opening scene reeves gives the audience some genuine horror psycho killer live streaming murder to his echo chamber the social commentary is clear and it even more disturbing when you remember this has actually happened in real life paul dano is sublime it great ensemble cast zoe kravitz is absolutely perfect loved every second she was on screen colin farrell is truly unrecognisable as penguin for once the mandatory comic relief is genuinely funny john turturro was chilling and jefferey wright is fine gordon peter sarsgaard is also superb in two pivotal scenes with that said do think there is one significant issue here it was wise not to tell yet another origin story but more balance was needed between the batman bruce wayne left the theatre not really knowing who this man is under the mask in fact think they did better job of building the backstory of selina kyle and is the film too long well maybe bit but it near impossible to pace constantly engaging hour film and this comes pretty damn close but finally that terrible sequel set up oh dear cringed please matt reeves remember batman has the greatest villain roster in comics we do not need to return to such well trodden ground but the rest of the film was so good will happily forget that mistake and eagerly anticipate what the future holds for this series my favourite film of the year so far1.0\tif you say otherwise your wrong sadly there is no but the rest of the movie is amazing it was like hours of heaven but unlike heaven described in the watchmen this heaven is not populated with horrors1.0\tsaw this film on march the 2nd all can say is it was perfect and all the cast the director did wonderful job can not wait for the next two installments though robert pattinson pull it off can not wait to see him as batman when the next two installments arrive in cinema you have my support 1000.0\twalked out went to see it with my husband and had low expectations and yet they managed to still disappoint me after an hour and half couldn bear anymore and left my husband at the theater and went grocery shopping my husband texted me half an hour later to pick him up with plans to maybe finish the movie when it on blue ray batman is so depressed it makes you wonder why he doesn quit his job love patterson and this movie makes his twilight acting seem good it doesn showcase his abilities in truth there were no characters could like or root for no reason to invest any time in seeing what happens next honestly cannot understand how this is getting an imdb rating of the reviews ve read have mostly been negative it is an emo batman in dark gotham as many have pointed out would honestly rather watch superman vs batman or moonfall again than this if it wasn rated so high would have given it 101.0\tmind blowing story and failure detectives trying to figure out the truth outstanding performance from pattinson and catwomen best story from mat reeves and he should make the batman0.0\tsorry to say was disappointed the movie wasn bad but it took something away from me that father and son moment whenever there is new batman movie we have been waiting for to watch together reeves ignored the young audience and families and went straight for the hardcore batman detective fans nolan trilogy is hard to beat1.0\tfor the past 15 years only commercial superhero movies have seen the light of day finally warner bros has taken the step of new era of superhero cinema if warner bros continues to allow directors such freedom the dc universe will mark the history of cinema for its cinematic quality1.0\t10 10 movie flawless it is the first greedy disturbing and dark batman movie in some scenes it felt like watching horror thriller movie also it really shows how the caped crusader is the world greatest detective matt reevs did promise horror movie and he did fulfill the promise0.0\thow can we sink masterpiece character like batman think of batman movie where there is no batman it would have been more believable if he had acted as normal person who had not received acting training let robert pattinson play in the twilight series romantic boy as batman fan who watches other batman movies repeatedly and fondly wish hadn seen this movie wish they hadn produced movie that was so stagnant so boring so incompatible with batman friends who think that robert pattinson portrays batman very well probably haven seen the previous batman movies1.0\tthis movie is the best anticipated movie of the year and it is the best batman movie the action was amazing and the cinematography was master piece1.0\tentertainment value 10 story 10 execution 10 concept 10 acting 10 visual 10 10 music 10 10 action 10 villian 10 characters 10 pacing 10 dialouge 10 ending 10 final rating 101.0\tof course battinson is one of the best actors in other movies but he as batman is somethinelse this is one of the best movies ve ever watched superb and best as batfan from my childhood so very happy with this movie amazing an art much excited for batman universe as matt said he is going to do more work batman1.0\tgood gritty detective story that differs with the other batman films while emphasizing the part of batman that is the worlds greatest detective while the movie is long it longevity allows for the story to be fleshed out and have great pacing1.0\tthis movie has the most realistic take on batman yet dealing with his own consciousness cinematic shots were awesome loved every single minute of the movie1.0\tstarting from pattinson passing by the other actors the soundtrack the storyline the riddles the deep sadness inside batman wayne which was clear in pattinson eyes everything is perfect great opening for great new batman trilogy perfect movie1.0\tdark reckless and astonishing you ve never seen this type of movie about superhero this is really on an another we ve finally got raw and gritty batman here sometimes he couldn control his emotions he do mistakes and they re affectioning on him the biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we spend with batman as batman there very little of bruce wayne in this movie and absolutely fine with it this is story where he trying to figure out what he capable of and where his path lead him robert pattinson batman is different type he extremely intense and very menacing can say for 100 that he made this character even more deeper than anyone else the riddler in this movie is phenomenal after the joker in the dark knight this is absolutely the best villain he an insane killer who has his motives and you could really understand it also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius these riddles and puzzles are clever interesting and make batman to do some serious detective work something we all need because he is the best detective in the world and finally it on the screen you re going to smile during arkham scene zoe kravitz is wonderful catwoman her story is dramatic and touchable can say that she the love interest and anti hero all in one the chemistry between these two characters is meaningful and you can feel it while watching the movie long story short matt reeves and friends did great job they wrote and made story that will stay in cinema history for sure the bat is back and more than happy for that1.0\tthis was movie that really captured what feel the other batman movies have steered away from which is how bad of city gotham is everyone in the city is always on edge this movie really gave batman chance to create name for himself as the worlds greatest detective my only complaint about this amazing film is that the movie ended0.0\tbatman is batman want to see him as superhero and how we love him to be an escapism from the real world gadgets galore think pattison did good job in the role but it not the batman wanted to see it was too real and stripped down the ending was rushed poor attempt to be deep and catwoman mask made me laugh did not fall in love or get to know any of the characters really but it was good portrayal from the riddler1.0\twatched it twice love the plot the cinematography the action sequences the casts were stellar cannot say it beats the dark knight but it is good batman movie1.0\tso good the story 10 actors 10 10 the music 10 10 one of the best movie have ever watched hope they will make the batman trilogy for robert pattinson he deserved that1.0\twill be brief in this review the film itself is not bad at all indeed it is absolutely one of the best batman seen on the big screen it is film full of references the long halloween and year one mainly and videogames there are thousand easter eggs that make you think of any villain from hush joker court of owls and maybe why not bane this batman is real detective who beats like gorilla finally batman is detective like in the comics paul dano is extremely exceptional pattinson in the part of batman is perfect while in the part of bruce wayne so so james gordon is perfect the penguin too but alfred seemed bit flat as character the only problem is the duration about hours in my opinion are too many for this film despite having well balanced moments let say that the duration is felt lot in short it is great product with an unforgettable soundtrack we needed serious batman and investigator after the flop of ben affleck batman1.0\tim gonna keep this short really loved this movie think the acting cinematography setting story and characters were all so well executed definitely recommend watching it ve seen lot of people expect this movie to be something it not ve seen people complain there no comedy or lightheartedness or that it not kid friendly and that true this movie pushes that pg 13 rating at times however don think that bad thing enjoyed that it was darker batman and that it was actually done right it leans lot more into the detective aspect of batman and really liked that also although it hours long it does not feel like it was so entertained that didn realize hours had gone by the only complaint is that because of the rain and how dark it is some of the scenes were kind of confusing to watch but nothing major1.0\tthis version of batman has never been done before robert pattinson brought forth portrayal of batman unique of what no other actor has done micheal keaton will always be known as comical batman christian bale as suave billionaire batman and robert pattinson as his own version of which only time can tell how it will be perceived as cinematography costume stunts storyline excellent there is no padding of runtime in this movie every minute is crucial to the plot and keeps you engaged the close to hour runtime felt like because of excellent pacing truly masterpiece1.0\tit was good but could ve been better pattinson was neither good nor bad they could ve found someone better imo he just didn look the part wasn convinced that he could be batman and take all those bad guys in the fight scenes zoe kravitz was even less convincing that girl is twig and there no way just no way she could pull that stuff off without movie magic paul dano colin ferrell john turturro and jeffrey wright we re all excellent no complaints there the tone and videography we re what made the movie so kudos to matt reeves for that1.0\tthis movie really was pleasant ride overall think it was the revival of dc movies this to me is the perfect batman movie he just an ordinary person with dark past and can control the city by himself of course this movie isn for everybody because some people don find hour crime triller exciting but for me it was the perfect movie adaptation of batman robert pattison1.0\tthe batman pulls from at least different graphic novels to give us view of bruce in his early years in way we haven seen on screen pattinson more than proves he can handle the mantle of the bat zoë brings catwoman to life that comic fans will recognize and appreciate paul dano psychotic riddler created sense of dread and terror reminiscent of of john doe in seven the rest of the cast hit their marks and then some finally gotham is portrayed as the grimy corrupt broken city it always meant to be 10 out of 101.0\tliked lot of the movie soundtrack was good even tough they overused lot of soundtracks cinematography was great loved voice acting of the actors the thing that annoyed me was that it was kinda slow mo but not really robert pattison moved very slowly in every scene zoe kravitz tried to do that but clearly failed to stay still for very long time the movie was great but the constant usage of couple of soundtracks and trying to stay still for the camera style really tired me in the end wanted to enjoy it so much but in the end was tired and my head was hearting1.0\tthe cinematography itself is oscar worthy the writing is on point and focused upon batman detective skills and the importance of the mystery elements that previous batman movies lacked pattinson batman is surprisingly good and grounded1.0\tthe best one yet matt reeves nailed it ever actor in this movie were fantastic have watched this movie times and still haven gotten enough of this masterpiece recommend everyone to watch this movie waiting for the sequel eagerly0.0\tway too many plot twists by far the worst batman movie this decade and last robert pattinson was poor choice for batman he not confident not built not charismatic at least not in the movie1.0\tthe movie is good the art direction has nothing to complain about but does anyone feels like the main theme sounds like darth vader theme some of my fellow star wars fans has the same feeling while watching the movie the movie stays true to the comics art direction as fan ioved the human approaching of batman the dark tones the detective solving style but don know dc will take such high risk to make main theme music like this0.0\thours wasted don get the high reviews even george clooney played better batman been waiting to see this so disappointed please don let there be another batman with pattinson face it christian bale has set the standard for batman1.0\tthis film depicts the perfect dark gloomy city that gotham is love how we get to see darker side of the batman and less outgoing makes it feel more realistic that batman raised as an orphan with no parents would turn out to be more reserved and stays to himself rather than playboy the suit pattison wears is also the best eve ever seen in film and the way he plays batman is incredible everyone who thought you can have the batman without the joker was proven wrong after this film the riddler was incredible and made the movie length no problem at all 10 10 film in all aspects for me it may be recency bias but might say the batman is better than the dark knight1.0\tthis movie was everything wanted batman after so many adaptions finally feels done right and he has great character arc in the movie although robert pattinson bruce wayne wasn anything great zoe kravitz as catwoman and jeffrey wright as gordon were good paul dano as riddler was awesome and close to heath ledger joker collin farrell as penguin was really good and has confirmed spin off show which can go further into his character the action in this movie is great although don expect big fight scene every 10 minutes they finally show batman as great detective this movie visually is amazing 10 finally the dark knight has rival at being the best comic book movie1.0\tthe batman has everything you would want in good film amazing cinematography story acting action mystery suspense all in film on darker take on the batman please watch this film at cinema1.0\tevery aspect gorgeous aesthetically pleasing environments with incredible acting and perspective from cinemaphotography pattinson takes the cake easy for the best batman of all time truly astonishing performance and genuinely would suggest to anyone looking for pure gritty gothic movie presenting the mentally traumatised bruce whilst also being incredibly enjoyable1.0\treally feel like they had to work so hard on this movie so they could compete with the dark knight one of the best batman movies ever what real batman should be1.0\tnew favorite batman movie robert patterson did great job loved everything about the movie the dark theme was amazing and the soundtracks were great too1.0\tloved this movie cinematography was great very ambitious was surprisingly underwhelmed by the acting done by zoe kravitz it wasn her character it was her acting very weird and kinda shallow1.0\tthis movie looks amazing the cinematography just love it it not just normal superhero movie its basically noir thriller and it fits perfectly to the character of batman robert pattinson plays an amazing batman and bruce wayne it different approach but interesting zoe kravitz always delivers and she also does here the story doesn feel like batman it feels like noir crime movie and its sooo perfect it dark and mysterious and an amazing experience in the cinema1.0\tabsolutely amazing movie well worth the watch definitely in the top batman movies also the music used was absolutely perfect loved the riddler the take on him was so good1.0\tpattinson proved once again he is great actor and deserves to be on the very top gotham finally feels true dark and hopeless zoe kravitz paul dano and the penguin casting choices all ticked the box for perfection no space for jokes lots of investigation and no filler super hero action sequences think we can definitely say it new beginning for the city of gotham0.0\tshould have made tv series instead was 3hr borefest nothing to like absolutely nothing comical storyline poor sobby batman very poor casting can believe wasted 15 to watch this worse even wasted my precious time thinking it will become better at some point0.0\tthis is the worst film ve ever seen and have to admit that haven seen it all yet because we both walked out of the the cinema about an hour in there was no real story line the acting was appalling1.0\tliked the individual characters the atmosphere and acting but story as whole was pretty anticlimactic robert and zoe were amazing but the script could have been so much better it not bad movie but it not great one either kind of disappointed because the cast is awesome and felt like if it weren for them this movie would have tanked hard definitely would have been bummed if paid to sit in theatre for this so glad it was released on crave hbo1.0\tit fun investigation action movie but with it main detective wearing bat costume really liked what they did with gotham and action scenes as whole robert pattinson and zoe kravitz did great job playing their roles while enjoyed the movie really don think it had to be almost hours long haha0.0\tonly reason stars is props to rich world manipulation 10 10 on manipulation never seen before better work on manipulation of mass people great work1.0\tin my opinion it the best batmon movies in batman series so don listen anyone bad thoughts about it just watch and then you realise it best movie ever1.0\tbatman is depressed he is dark he is brutal and he is 24 didnt buy any bruce wayne scene in this movie pattison is great batman but weak bruce wayne his emo goth hair cut and his average size didnt help at all while in batman he is towering over all the other character he is massive and his punch connect with the force of truck and then we see him shirtless muscular yes but not nearly as big and strong as the batman they tried to portay here pattison is weird choice in my opinion not bad actor at all but he has very few lines and his stare have lot of screen time every lines is designed to made him look big and strong but he is not did like the detective angle and the progression toward finale the photo direction was incredible almost every shot of this movie could be wallpaper they did an incredible job with the tone gotham is dirty corrupted and rainy city the car chase is brutal overall had good time just feared that if we saw more of bruce wayne this movie would fall apart because pattison did not impress me the costume did the job for him while in batman but am not convince he would hold the audience if they had focused more on bruce wayne1.0\tnot super hero movie dark gritty and nothing like you ve ever seen in batman movie thought it was casted perfectly and the actors really carry the movie only downside for me was that it seemed like it was written to be rated movie but was edited for wider audience don get me wrong definitely still hard pg 13 but think an rating would have been the cherry on top1.0\tfresh storyline did not know it is less action packed but showed actions are really good good cinematography and it felt to me like crime investigation thriller than action genere do not watch this movie by experiencing it as action packed but it really good1.0\tthis is one of those movies that you will say in couple of years that you had the privilege of watching in the cinema it everything ever hoped for and more mat reeves did his homework some scenes are ripped straight out of the comic books truly enjoyed it for what it truly is great batman story honestly think it the best batman representation on live action screen ever story is good not flawless but it keeps you invested for almost hours straight superb acting and really amazing cinematic experience gave it 10 10 because it the best batman ve ever seen1.0\twe have the first big movie of the year for those who doubted we have here perfect example that actors deserve their second chance and robert pattison and matt reeves bring their vision of how the story of the bat is told first need to start talking about the direction and the technical aspects matt reeves what class man he manages to immerse you in that universe in the first scene it dark hopeless rainy gotham and you feel there giving it even to smell it and he manipulates the atmosphere of tension and mystery in masterful way the investigative sequences reminded me of films like zodiac and se7en worth the recommendation both are on hbo max and if the director manipulates the sinister atmosphere of the film very well when the action is another beautiful thing forget that shaky camera you have well choreographed movements an editing that avoids chopping the scenes the blows are felt and they have weight implying that the henchmen are not there to be beaten and he makes thing love that is uncut scenes of beating and with the long shot it beautiful thing it even has chase scene that left me almost breathless in the chair and the technical aspects huh the cinematography of this film plays with shadows sunsets rain fog and it does very well the contrast of many characters having with the red also the present threat and the sound work people few times saw it in the cinema film such refined sound work you hear every little thing in that city it sound editing and mixing class and immersion too and don even need to talk about the visual effects if there is because all the scenes saw seemed everything is real my only regret is that in the final third of the film it started to repeat itself and get little tired the editing couldn be uniform all the time you end up feeling the almost hours of film but what about the cast robert pattinson delivers his version of batman with precision much darker and depressive and more violent too he carries his marks in doubt and vulnerability not to mention that the man is few ideas and he really hits zoe kravitz is also great he convinces very well as fragile and cool woman who beats everyone and her chemistry pattison is great paul dano makes sinister and menacing riddler he not only convinces with the dangers he is capable of but also puts the characters in conflict all the time and you fear his presence even when he is not on the scene colin farrell is great and unrecognizable also the great makeup work and jeffrey wright makes much more pessimistic gordon along with andy serkis keeping all alfred characteristics was going to talk about the script and how it brings contemporary issues to us but then it would be too much detail and would get into spoilers but those who have watched it will know what talking about concluding batman is sensational movie everything that the hero fan might want is present and it is yet another beautiful addition to the superhero genre note1.0\treally good entertaining very cinematic more crime dramay like the batman cartoon tv show thought it was well made and liked it better than other batman movies definitely movie to take someone to if they don know much about batman because everything seems explained and may help get your girlfriend into the fandom0.0\twas looking forward to the batman 2022 both because batman is the most interesting superhero to me and because warner bros have created some pretty decent superhero films recently the suicide squad and aquaman stand out unfortunately the film we actually got in the end was almost totally devoid of any positive qualities my favorite film of all time is the dark knight 2008 and in many ways the batman is an inversion of the dark knight batman in this film is certainly more faithful to the comic books for all that means but he is also very shallow and one note batman is reduced considerably both in his abilities as well as his charisma in matter of fact pattinson batman is totally uncharismatic don know that would lay this at the actor feet since it clearly the direction that was asked of him but it is not entertaining to see in action nor does it live up to the potential of the character as vehicle for social commentary though this movie has almost no serious meaning or message it does dip very shallowly into the realm of contemporary politics choosing side and of course it the one you would expect from hollywood studio and the delivery of its political message is very crude and ignorant think this has as much to do with the delays in production that plagued this film as it does with the amateurish writing of director matt reeves and lead writer peter craig the city of gotham in this film is more alike to the presentation of totally fictional and fantasy universe than anything resembling real city which may please comic book fans but comes at the expense of being able to take the very boring and predictable story of this film and its characters seriously about the plot if you re even slightly paying attention you will understand the sum total of what happening within the first scene of the film and there are no twists this film isn creative enough to have anything unexpected happen and because even docile audience will figure out what going on very early in the film it is forced to rely on the stupidity of the main character for its contrived plot to work seeing batman unable to figure out really simple things is very frustrating and if you have seen this movie you will know that this happens at least once every few minutes fans of action will also be disappointed with this film as it is very slow burn mystery for the most part only because of its simplistic plot the only person being mystified is the titular lead and his incompetent coterie the fights that take place are short and batman manages to come off as both considerably weaker than his other incarnations while also completely avoiding any sense of realism or tension about the tension well the villain in this film is the riddler as the trailer spoils bizarrely the trailer spoils huge amount of significant plot information stuff that doesn happen until the final quarter of the film and this also serves to undermine the idea that the slow burn mystery could have any payoff even still it not like there anything complex nuanced or innovative in the story that being told here or in the presentation of the characters the riddler himself is devoid of personality and his motives are completely transparent to the audience though as usual batman struggles to understand them there very little fun to be had with this film and it seems am not alone in this feeling because several people walked out on it during the screening forced myself to sit through the whole thing to give it fair shake but alas really wish hadn if you don like this movie within the first 20 minutes you will not come to like it at any point after1.0\tif someone had asked me before the batman movie was there any perfect cbm that existed precisely like ripoff from the comic book my answer would have been no but after watching matt reeve the batman let me tell you it does exist and the answer is this everything about this movie is so so so good from the casing to the plot music cinematography so perfect robert has done phenomenal work portraying batman in his 2nd year couldn choose whether this is movie or graphic novel and the cameo at the last minute blows everyone away every cbm should be like this hats off to the director and everyone behind this eat success1.0\tthis is the batman arkham origins of multiverse ok thanks for the dark knight rises and happy saraswati puja and happy saraswati pujo te brk are ami amar dadar number diayis kano are you want to do with the day of multiverse ok with1.0\tthis is the one of the best batman movies ever as well as the darkest movie have ever watched may be some viewers can enjoy this as much as enjoyed but if they try to understand this movie deeply they will keep this remember for very very long time please experience this movie only in theaters0.0\tit was different take which was interesting however it was very slow the action was very boring catwoman had more interesting fight scenes than batman did overall would be okay if never watched it again1.0\tcan think of single thing disliked about this movie this is easily my favorite comic book movie of all time can wait to see what matt reeves does with this series of films0.0\tit was probably the most boring movie ve watched in awhile almost felt like he was gonna sparkle few times in the sunlight got too much of saw vibe mixed with dark city but im sure it was more comic related but don read comics prefer an actual book don need pictures to help me get through book1.0\tthere are no negative sides to draw out from this movie it was perfect from the start to the end everyone nailed it acting cinematography writing characters score editing directing etc1.0\tthe script action scenes and other aspects of the movie were excellent but think the acting could ve been bit better and kind of ruined 10 10 movie1.0\tthis movie is for pure comic fan who knows the batman from the comics from the video games robert and zoe has done an amazing job and matt has provided great direction this story and plot is absolutely new and you will love it if you have read the comics1.0\tdirector matt reeves take on the cape crusader is darker more grounded interpretation than previously envisioned even mores than nolan the film also filled with great performances including zoe kravitz catwoman robert pattinson troubled bruce wayne batman and colin ferrell unrecognizable penguin paul dano performance as the riddler is also compelling as he portrays zodiac killer inspired foe that pushes the limits of batman it visually stunning film but not in the cgi spectacle way the way each scene is blocked how the action is directed and the scope that lies within the setting all work also there batmobile chase that made the hairs on my arms stand up my only complaint is the length at nearly three hours it can linger the only caveat to this is wouldn necessarily know what to edit since the pacing and length of each scene was crucial to the narrative great start to promising future0.0\tll save you some time reading so ll just list the many flaws this movie has flaws bad cast slow paced and love slow movies boring dialogue cringey quotes hours easily could have been hours riddler costume looked like gimp suit cat woman didn play her role well at all the batman looked emo and depressed cliche plot terrible acting at many points throughout unrealistic pain tolerance no blood like cmon positive aspects cinematography cgi1.0\tthis movie absolutely delivered originally thought that it was going to follow the typical superhero formula it doesn at all it long movie don get me wrong but am glad it is you are engaged the whole time1.0\tgood to see real movie with good plot and good dialogues refreshing to see after all of mcu kiddish movies with lame jokes and unconvincing plots and characters1.0\tin its essence if you take away the costumes gadgets villain names which were nice it just detective movie and while good was not great one at that have to say this is the least batmanish batman movie ve seen you simply just don get that vibe would ve given it for detective movie except that got good value for my money with the long run time and you know it batman that gotta count for something0.0\tthe batman to me did not echo good ol sleek and action ready mr wayne instead we got the most saddest version of edward cullen in his little gothic castle with his batmobile that looked like an american muscle car on steroids and his bleeding eyeliner that is all have to say1.0\tpattison is the new batman was surprised by how good he in the movie his dark acting is perfect as bruce wayne mysterious vibe the story is good enchanting from start to finish love it cannot wait for the sequel1.0\tperfectly crafted masterpiece filled with beautiful cinematography compelling story telling remarkable acting and electrifying music score this is truly cinema at its best this is not just the best batman movie but one of the best comic book movies ever made in world where studios are opting for light hearted content matt reeves stayed loyal to the comics and gave dc fans something to cbeer for long long time can weite paragraphs about how good it is but still they won be enough bravo matt reeves1.0\tzero camp zero pretension finally batman movie that feels earned reeves script and no frills direction are straight and to the point and that point is that the batman character and gotham city are much more interesting when he actually has something to do so much of the batman feels like reset and despite the nearly hour running time it feels lean and mean constantly driving forward it isn action however that drives the plot reeves has finally made batman detective story and rather than waste time rehashing the dark knight tropes he peppers the retreaded plot points with queasy new angles what if the wayne family has directly contributed to the decline of gotham what if the enemies batman manifests are more successful in change than he can be inevitably this film will be compared to its predecessors but it up to the task the batman is the first batman film that seems to truly understand the underpinnings and contradictions of the batman characters avoiding the kitsch and contrivances that plagued even nolan revisionist the dark knight it easy to overlook the dark knight glaring flaws because heath ledger was such galvanizing figure here reeves barely has time for bruce wayne alfred or gordon instead we get fully realized selena kyle and scene chewing turns by turturro and farrell to keep the mystery chugging along all of this makes for complicated villain in the riddler who it turns out is much more terrifying and worthy adversary than we ve seen in the batman cinematic world whereas the joker was anarchic and sadistic paul dano riddler is far more complicated and motivated making for genuinely uncomfortable final act the batman ranks with the dark knight mask of the phantasm and tim burton batman as one the very best superhero films and in many ways it outdoes them1.0\tthis is one gooood movie and it is one of the best comic book movie right after tdk great action scenes perfect cinematography and perfect music score the whole experience in the theater is perfect the story has some little issues mainly with the dialogue but other than that great people main concern was the darkness but it does feel wrong the length is not problem either felt like nothing worth the hype1.0\tthink it safe to say that this is the best batman had been since the nolan trilogy and even then there moments where it way better than even those films1.0\treally don like superheroes just like my mother since superheroes always win this movie just know going to call it the most atrocious movies seen1.0\tbeautiful and pleasant the technical work was phenomenal the script made sense and wasn lazy written not many cgi scenes and purely real filming amazing cinematography on point music and very effective matt reeves and his team really outdid themselves wish we could get more movies likes this because this is cinema0.0\twanted to like it and at times did but my god the run time is so self indulgent few people literally walked out before the final final end as this film has about ends to it feels like they couldn decide on one so just did them all it very dark and serious which liked but then has really silly bits that don fit the film some of it was taken straight out of slapstick the groups of police running around made me laugh out loud and something happens in car chase that is straight up stupid like fast and furious stupid also was it just me but was it all extremely obvious throughout the biggest twist was as clear it comes liked how they made batman more of dectective this time around shame he wasn very good at it in fact not sure this batman is particularly good at anything apart from very slowly walking into the scene and very slowly looking around but maybe that the point he just man very slow man or emo teenager as they made him for some reason1.0\tgood movie bad batman if not the worden ever batman autor ive seen shallow the villains are better than the bat love the bat collector of the detective comics and others please make it stop and please stop breaking the rules there is lots to make better0.0\tnot watching another movie from this director ever again unbelivable slow movie was so bored that had to read newspapers while watching this movie not much action all in all mostly just slow talking im not sure about the people who has given this movie 10 10 stars either they are payed to do that or they have never seen movie before recommend having ready alternative things to do while watching this movie1.0\tno true spoilers but will talk about few details you might want to see for yourself before reading ye have been warned nolan who keaton who there were multiple times during my screening of matt reeves the batman that literally had me smiling big fat toothy cheek straining smile couldn help it my edible might have helped elicit that smile but was so happy during this screening it was ridiculous seeing true batman detective story engulfed in the cling wrap of horror and sadism provided by the riddler topped with perfect catwoman and supported by the best version of gotham city ve ever seen made me really happy take batman out and you still have thrilling crime mystery comparisons could be made to taxi driver zodiac and seven combining film noir 70 grit and horror to weave dark and dramatic story lifted directly from some of the most heralded batman comics that was really special to me seeing elements of frank miller year one jeph loeb the long halloween darwin cooke ego brought to life and mixed with snippets and frames of other beloved dark knight stories it reminded me of why people go so crazy for comic movies still jaded especially when it comes to modern mainstream superhero movies thought for certain warner brothers and dc films greedy desire to build resurrect reboot the dcu would totally mess this movie up was expecting them to shoehorn in avenues for wonder woman aquaman flash etc lick the boot of the all mighty the all encompassing the mega load marvel cinematic universe using the same strategy and direction of those films for this new batman tell story so wholly incomplete you need two or three sequels just to feel like you ve actually seen complete film and thank god none of that happened reeves stuck to his guns fought to make his story and told it his way it paid off for starters it not an origin story chris nolan batman begins is perfect inception film tim burton joel schumacher and nolan have shown us the baby steps we ve already seen him train we ve seen him build the batsuit witnessed his parents die etc reeves and crew decided to begin our batman two years into his crime fighting crusade and that was perfect move this batman is reckless less patient and more emotionally driven we hit the ground running by opening on halloween day right at the start of riddler murder spree ve been saying for years that robert pattinson is one of hollywood most exciting actors pattinson batman bruce wayne is the 2005 emo dream boy wish could ve looked like when was 13 joking aside this is fresh take on bruce wayne not so much billionaire playboy as disconnected recluse he literally hates the sun watching him mull over dusty files and scan crime scenes for clues is deeply satisfying hearing diary entries delivered through monologue provide us with insight into wayne process that other film entries never had seeing that he forces himself to write everything down to avoid losing the memories in the blurry dark sea of ceaseless nights think we can all relate to that in different ways this film also addresses key detail no other batman movie ever has the black eye makeup over the years we ve seen small army of guys in the cowl they take off the mask and magically there is no trace of the black eye makeup they all wear this batman keeps it real we see his make up run all the time when he takes that mask off there is sweat and dirt and makeup everywhere it really cool detail that makes the movie feel more realistic and gritty pattinson is surrounded by excellent supporting cast members knew at the very least the batman would work cast wise couldn imagine these actors giving bad performances zoë kravitz is the best on screen catwoman ever not taking anything away from the other performers who have played the character reeves and peter craig simply wrote better selina kyle and kravitz takes it for all it worth physically perfect for the role but more importantly good enough actor to make us believe she really exists in gotham it hard to not be upstaged by bat and his villains this selina kyle soars above them jeffery wright jim gordon is exactly what we needed him to be batman and gordon work as true partners wherever batman is jim is right there with him clever uses of humor and well written dialogue make this jim gordon shine am certain there will be spin off tv series called book of gordon which leaves us to the villains batman rogues gallery is deep roster filled with incredible characters while would love to see villain that hasn yet graced the big screen really dug paul dano take on the riddler he played like modern day extremist and it topical yet un cheesy dano goes big that just him so knew riddler was going to be howling goraning beast in what looks like the body of 16 year old dano is almost 40 but somehow still looks like boy they exploit it in this movie the way almost all serial killers have childlike lostness deeply embedded in their heavy faces speaking of heavy colin farrell is unrecognizable as oz oswald penguin can not think of robert deniro but that good thing using every pound of his physical bulk and that classic prohibition era nyc mobster drawl penguin is fascinating villain john turturro plays good falcone he modern sleazy creepy it all looks and sounds right the desperation of gotham city is palpable everything is dripping wet and grimy crime is on the rise it feels lot like the city live in greig fraser who just came off of the brilliant dune is one of the best cinematographers working in the business the shots are so clever and creative yet economical the camera lack of movement boldly intensifies the action rather than series of bourne style quick cuts the camera is mounted and unflinching as batman pummels his foes it replicates batman style of watching staking out waiting perfectly silent and still for the right moment to emerge from the shadows why move the camera if you don need to the sets are so spectacular wish could pause the movie and just revel in it all about midway through there is genius pov shot from batman perspective as he tails and watches selina he on an opposing rooftop looking into her shabby apartment trying to get read on who she is it actually duplicates the film opening shot but instead it from riddlers pov as he stalks his first victim also from an opposing rooftop it essentially blurs the line between them their motives may be polar opposites but their operations are eerily similar that great visual storytelling active engaged viewers will be able to connect those dots without the use of expositional dialogue we re not so different you and which brings me to what keeps the batman from masterpiece territory there are few small things being as though this is mainstream movie that needs to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars by putting as many asses in seats as possible understand some of the dialogue has extra exposition some things are needlessly explained or repeated it makes sense from business viewpoint but still wish it wasn there at times dialogue can feel little cut up and chewed for you but it done to help your stupid uncle who probbaly taken pee breaks understand what going on think the best films use exposition sparingly and cleverly and for the most part the batman does but it makes the outliers standout another gripe this should ve been rated to really sell the horror intensity aspect more effectively there should ve been more blood near the end of the film batman shoots himself up with adrenaline venom possibly for any die hards out there and starts beating guy face in with multiple punches his face should ve looked like ground meat the fact he had some bruising and lumpy nose didn really show what kind of terrible things batman especially supercharged batman is truly capable of blood should ve been spraying on batman face as jim gordon pulls him off of the thug who we can assume will need to be hooked to ventilator for the rest of his life same for riddler he is sadistic brutal murderer and selective blood gore can be really effective way to showcase brutality by holding that element back this felt little too safe think of films like the silence of the lambs or no country for old men and how they handled grotesque violence the violence is incredibly dramatic and upsetting but it delivered in small yet concentrated doses this goes with my complaint above about being mainstream film that needs to be optimized for the masses an rating can adversely affect that income but sheesh get really excited when think about how few more cranks on the brutality dial could ve really made this the best batman movie ever seen and honestly this is close to what personally feel would be my perfect bat flick but don like being teased with something dark and edgy and then pulling it back when it comes time to show it off once again don agree with it but understand it get why this ultimately couldn be rated get why they need to simplify or re explain some things like am doing right now but if they left that stuff out and got out of their own way have zero hesitation in saying this isn only the best batman film ever made but one of the best action films ever made despite my small issues with the movie am still in love with this film and totally captivated by it brilliant pacing insane set pieces gorgeous musical score and stunning photography film and comics are two of the most impressive and immersive visual mediums and the batman is glorious example1.0\tit everything hoped for and more matt reeves dawn and war of the planet of the apes are both very well crafted films but the batman has solidified his position as the best franchise filmmaker working today rarely are films of this budget made so intricately and with such care the strongest element of the movie is the filmmaking and style which is phenomenal every single frame is gorgeous and deliberate giving the sense of clear vision throughout the movie is edited and paced perfectly sound is used so well the weight of the bat suit can be felt as batman walks from the shadows gotham feels alive and lived in city that no matter how hard you scrub and clean will always be dirty city submerged in darkness and never ending rain was fully immersed in the movie from beginning to end the casting is also great robert pattison has proven himself to be great actor from good time and the lighthouse dare say he the best interaction of the bat here bruce wayne isn the playboy instead his trauma still lingers to the point where he doesn socialise out of fear of losing people close to him bruce wayne is natural extension of batman but it all he has there even narration which could easily bring down scene but it used so well and puts us in the head of batman in way that not been done before robert pattison eyes are what make him standout from previous versions of the character so much weight is felt behind them and every action from him is purposeful all the supporting cast is great as well zoe kravitz catwoman paul dano riddler jeffery wright who embodies jim gordon and colin farrell who disappears into the role of penguin not to forget andy serkis alfred the plot is reminiscent of the work of david fincher it carefully planned slow burn that focused on its characters it defies conventions of superhero movies it small stakes serial killer movie with batman as the detective and not purely an action movie sure there some actions sprinkled around and those scenes are great but it not the focus this is take on batman we haven seen before and watching the story unfold was such joy my only minor complaint was tease towards the end that felt wasn necessary the batman was mesmerising experience and showed what blockbuster can be in the right hands one of the finest superhero movies ve seen1.0\tok just returned home from the theatre and writing this review well if there one word to describe this movie then it is impressive damn this is the kind of batman movie was always waiting for the dark and gritty atmosphere perfectly reflects what gotham is and what type of people it houses the best thing about this movie is the treatment of it protagonist they say that batman is the world greatest detective but can remeber any movie earlier since the 00 that actually potrays batman as detective that why always wanted to see this side of the character or the story and this movie exactly delivers that apart from the detective thing it shows almost everything batman is fear hope determination courage etc this movie is made for the hardcore fans and they will surely resonate with it then coming to the other factors the plot is convoluted and instantly grabs the interest of general audience they didn waste second as the story was big and impactful which makes the runtime nearly hours but when the movie ended wanted to experience more of batman and more of gotham also they gave some messages too regarding character ideologies coz that necessary in batman film but reeves knew that as tdk mastered on that platform so he needed to deliver something different and unique so am really impressed now when say this is the best batman film you folks would think that it is better than tdk but actually not tdk is much more mature movie with different treatment not really superhero movie so tdk is better film but the batman is the best batman film hope you understand the point1.0\tif you re watching this movie feel like seven or zodiac you might not be wrong matt reeves designed gotham in its darkest version perhaps even more than the joker himself wounded bruce wayne roams behind bat mask we also have the loyal and honest detective gordon who supports batman in solving the riddle of the riddler also the catwoman who stores sorrows inside her and we see the effect of that in every action she takes as for the riddler ten lines will not suffice me to describe the extent of evil and madness in his eyes and the intelligence that is evident in his mind games stayed on the edge of my seat every moment this damned person appeared on the screen the penguin is an indescribable thing he has an overwhelming energy that emerges in every crazy scene he leads although it does not affect the plot directly and may not be from the person who focused the film on analyzing his character maybe because it thebruce wayne movie anyway it an experience that don think in any way could have been better and more satisfying on the cinematic side apart from being dc movie the actors are all in the best condition the style of directing and the wonderful script that matt reeves topped the scene in what great movie that was1.0\tdid not feel like hours and is definitely up there with those from the nolan trilogy really good dark gritty batman film robert pattinson really suprised me with how well he played this role he really made it his own instead of trying to be like christian bales interpretation of batman zoe kraviyz paul dano colin farrell and jeffery wright all had brilliant performance0.0\tnothing special about the movie desperate attempt to make batman with saw twist long and drawn out with plenty of unnecessary time wasting the story isn any difference from murder movie with clues1.0\twow would watch more than once definitely great batman movie move over ben affleck more of this universe please it has so much potential the action is sublime practical effects add so much to scenes1.0\tsorry little bit sleepy when watching this movie but the action can not deny most of them action what we hope to show up on batman movies modern gadgets not too much show off1.0\tsuch beautiful movie haven been this impressed since christian bales the dark knight the movie was gloomy dark and mysterious the theme and music was absolutely perfect still humming it right now whilst typing this it had what batman movie should have which to be frank ben afflecks movies lacked at first when saw pattinson on the cast was doubtful but take back everything said he plays batman absolutely perfectly and also fits his aesthetic look his acting was phenomenal in this movie and so was zoe look forward to seeing more of this pattinson kravitz duo in future movies 10 10 of movie and hope we see more of this cast and more batman movies just can describe in words how much loved and enjoyed watching this movie1.0\tdon even know what to say other than this is perfect film even if you re typically not into superhero movies but appreciate the art of film you ll love this movie nothing else to say without giving anything away other than go see this movie and don listen to anyone saying it too long could it have been shorter of course but sure glad it wasn wish it was longer actually1.0\tone of the best comic movies ever paul dano and robert pattinson are playing the roles great robert pattinson is the best batman ever he played the role like no one before the setting of gotham is great and dark1.0\tbest movie ve seen bdbdhsjjsjskkakkakakakakakakakakakkakakakakakjajajajehehehjejejej hsbsbsbshsjsjsjsnsnsnnddhdydhdhhdhdhdhdhehehehehehhehehshsjhhhhhjjdjdjdjdjdksakakakahwhehehdhehehehdhshshshdhhdhddhdhde she he shown she she whew she sbehsnakalqkavdvehwwiaons dbrhehehrhe0.0\ttook long time to go anywhere when it gets there you find it wasn worth it if you want to watch batman film your better off spending time watching the dark knight trilogy1.0\tthe action was timed well and nothing felt too forced dialogue at times was bit corny but only to very small degree length was good for the plot given and didn feel dragged out but just perfect personally liked the new batman and how matt reeves decided to display gotham and it dark aspects solid for me nothing too crazy but just right for this version of the batman1.0\treally enjoyed the more realistic take on the character also loved seeing the detective side of batman robert pattinson was great choice for this take on the worlds greatest detective which focused more on his intelligence and strategy as opposed to bronze and gadgets colin farrell was unrecognizable and stole the show in way because every time he was on screen my sole focus was on him which is good thing if there few negatives can address it that batman being saved from certain death several times is bit much zoe kravitz also played her role great and should ve been the only save of the movie in my opinion also wish alfred had more screen time feel like the actor was slightly wasted john turturro as falcone was bit bland love the actor but they could ve done lot more with someone else all in all after watching it few more times this will definitely be one of my favorites right be side keatons first and begins really hope mr pattinson comes back for the sequels he is the batman1.0\tthis is how batman is which we deserve pattinson made another great batman in cinema history the intens the fear and mystery is great tool for this movie appreciation for mat reeves and pattinson for this movie good job1.0\tits was good but nothing special was hoping foe new bad assery kind of batman and it didn happen lots of political jargon but oh well it was done very well and had great cinematic look liked the characters but it wasn anything different than any other batman movies done before in the way of new it was just another story done another way that could have been done in the 90 as well as today it just didn do it for me especially with hr run time was expecting way more not bad just not what you would expect with all the hype1.0\thad mixed feeling towards it at the start but as the movie progressed movie took over me and everything was apt with perfect build up for each main character and the thrillers are placed more aptly robert pattinson stole the show by equally balancing the bruce wayne and batman riddler had justified his cold blooded act don want to exaggerate his role and lead to spoilers overall nice treat to watch in imax comparison with other batman movies or franchises is futile as film has different charisma and impact overall1.0\tlending fincher isque touch to the tale of decades old comic character matt reeves in the batman has gone all out to skillfully portray the need of batman as saviour and superhero in the contemporary gotham which is marred by filth and corrupt politics reeves plausible vision is headlined by terrific robert pattinson as the the batman pattinson with his radiant expressions amidst the dark world manages to capture all your attention his act is restrained one portraying an innate damage you ll certainly cheer for pattinson all along as he struggles to fight his inner evils while tackling the bad guys of gotham the essential bad guy here is riddler who has set off to clean the filthy gotham remember travis bickle in taxi driver paul dano act as the shrewd and frightening riddler is another highlight of the film easily the second best act after pattinson props to reeves again for wisely playing along the good vs bad drawing line or blurring as needed zoe kravitz is lovable too as the catwoman and makes the scheme of things more interesting adding to the cast hype are colin farrell jeffrey wright john turturro peler sarsgaard jayme lawson obvious great actors name enough some more props to reeves and peter craig who have co blessed the film with watertight screenplay despite running for hours it never comes across as an exhausting fest also blessing the film is michael giacchino with score high on goosebumps while reeves portrays the figurative darkness of gotham greig fraser takes charge of the portraying the literal darkness of gotham in fraser lens the sun never shines on gotham the dark knight always sets off in the dark night fighting in lightless lanes besides everything engaging where reeves pattinson batman appeals the most is for its realism our celebrated superhero goes through existentialism to emerge as personality transcending the mere vengeance guy image fascinating1.0\tif you could have any doubts about this new batman mainly because of the anticipated criticism for not trusting robert pattinson who did not give the physique du role that the caped suit was going to be too big for him etc etc just watch the film to get all the comments in the ass dark as hell more than nolan trilogy and more than tim burton haloweesque style raw rude punk almost all the scenes take place at night with continuous rain oppressive gray state of constant depression to graph the decadent state of gotham that we already know consumed by crime and corruption the new batman despite being directly dressed in armor in contrast to the hood that seems to be sewn to frankenstein it is noticeable only in the photos shows the most detective side of him although he always seems to be running from behind another point in favor is that as bruce wayne appears only few minutes all the rest of the long hours is the bat man here he is allied with the very sexy selina kyle zoe kravitz who is never named as catwoman but is replaced by balaclava with little ears whip and many cats in her house she works for the bad guys but has reasons for revenge rounding out the cast are good guys jeffrey wright as gordon and andy serkis as alfred the bad guys are the riddler paul dano an avenging serial killer who makes saw style gadgets and leaves zodiac style coded messages in his eagerness to clean the city of corrupt people and the penguin oz very characterful colin farrell who plays it carmine falcone right hand man exquisitely played by john turturro the eternal mob boss of gotham city matt reeves cloverfield and two of the planet of the apes manages with master hand the tension the darkness and the outbursts of violence in long film which could easily have been little shorter with setting reminiscent of the two by burton from the early 90s crossed with seven batmobile out of fast and furious from hell the car chase is one of the high points and score as ominous as horror movie so much so that the reversal of something in the way of nirvana as leitmotif seems to be sung by cobain from beyond it so good that they have time to put dory that reminds her of aunt harriet bust of shakeapeare see photo in comments both referencing the 66 series and even put the little joke of walking penguin within so much ominousness after so many problems the stoppage due to covid and the falls turned into memes an adventure to see in highly recommended movie1.0\tdidn actually see the movie yet but my wife and kids did and they absolutely loved it they were so impressed with spider man no way home but now say that pales in comparison to the batman1.0\twas very impressed with robert pattison and the type of batman that matt reeves has displayed on screen already the film differentiated itself very well from the dark knight trilogy which thought was extremely impressive albeit both were very well done it really felt like was watching horror psychological film play out and it exceeded every expectation had for this film loved it and look forward to what next1.0\ttdk was the standard by which all future batman movies would be compared to however reeves pattinson and the batman have completely changed that this film takes batman back to basics in very good way1.0\tthe best live action batman ever pattinson is about to become your favourite dark knight just badass and thrilling dano and farrell just knock it out of the park thank you warner bros for taking superhero genre to new heights1.0\tthe movie was really well made however some parts of the plots were boring catwoman character was unnecessary in this story but robert acting and the whole gothic vibe was actually not bad loved the cinematic theatricals and the sounds1.0\tamazing movie with top notch comic batman characteristics the justice has done to batman which was not given to ben affleck nolan batman is different emotion1.0\twhat can say absolutely perfection something else cinematography perfect directing perfect soundtracks ahhh absolutely in love with this movie robert pattinson killed it paul dano what great performance colin farrell was the perfect choice to this character really really in love with this movie matt reeves killed it0.0\tthere was not one thing liked in this movie the same background score is repeated the whole movie robert pattinson does the same thing he did in the twilight movies didn care about one single character just wasted my money1.0\tthis batman is based on the earth comics and does not follow the timeline of the previous dc films beautiful cinematography and epic soundtrack finally darker and less sweetened version unfortunately despite rather well structured script it really lasts too long almost hours don expect any post credit scenes rating1.0\tas hard as it is to say my pride has to take the loss on this one wasn thrilled with the idea of yet another standalone batman film trilogy and was even less excited when saw pattinson was gonna be stepping into the role of the caped crusader was so stubborn on it that never even planned on going to see it but when was invited to go with nothing else to do have to say enjoyed it lot it more of crime thriller than an action packed superhero blockbuster but man did they do good job keeping the darker tone with character like batman0.0\thave no idea where these positive reviews are coming from this is not batman this is twilight heart throb cinematic moments with clash of the titans cheese walked out before it finished1.0\tit got me think the dark knight the movie is really simple and very well directed no big gadgets or action just simple bruce wayne being bruce wayne and it the best thing good acting by robert truly justified the role of batman worthy to watch1.0\teverybody is saying this film is better than the dark knight is it true honestly think it really hard to compare both films let me tell you why diferent directros diferent styles here is my impressions good points acting was superb pattinson and kravitz had chemistry colin farrell was also something to notice cinematography felt like real gotham city dark as should be you can see reeves style printed in every scene sounding mixage and soundtrack was really good although could be more striking in some scenes detective batman as it is in the comics more detective less playboy with fancy toys bad points runtime like long movies don get me wrong but after hours the film strugles to keep on pace script it is not bad don get me wrong again but seems that they wanted to throw too much stuff in just one film and felt some characters could be left to star in another films as they couldn focus on only one villain that said would recommend the film1.0\tat first gotta say the cinematography is absolutely beautiful and every shot looks really neat think matt reeve take on modern batman was really thought provoking but also felt true to some of the comics especially in the long halloween the riddler potrayal felt like it had some inspiration from se7en but overall it was just some small touches but the riddler really was whole new character on his own with his own flairs and style and really gritty and scary take on how the riddler would work on the real world the plot was beautifuly unfolded throughout the movie and even though it was hour movie never really felt like it enjoyed every bit really liked the neo noir direction style of the batman we can actually experience the nightmarish depiction of gotham city and how it corruption was spread through and through it had really interesting plot which makes the movie engaging but it wasn just plot driven all the characters had their own stories and events going on so it was perfectly balanced as the plot progressed and the impurities and crookedness are exposed it would make one think if gotham is really worth saving by this we can also see the vulnerability of batman and his inexperiences but that well understood cause it is his only 2nd year as batman he still learning to be the best version of the role he doing the only problem had with the movie was the potrayal of bruce wayne and how he seemed out of character and not like his flamboyant billionaire and playboy facade to the public both batman and bruce wayne seemed like the same person also maybe cause we didn really see much of bruce wayne the depiction of catwoman and penguin really felt true to their source material as whole it was really good to see the movie in the theatre with all it glory it really was the experience of lifetime rating 101.0\tthis is the batman movie ve always wanted to watch as huge fan it straight up detective neo noir mystery with strong horror influences movie rob will be the definitive batman for movies like kevin conroy is for animation and video games it clear him and matt reeves love the characters and this universe the other actors were all amazing as well paul dano as riddler was mind blowing and zoe kravitz and colin farrell were perfect as catwoman and penguin can wait to see where they will go next for the sequels even if you are not batman fan you must watch this personally think is the best comic book movie ever made and deserves to stand next to classic thrillers like se7en zodiac the silence of the lambs and prisoners1.0\tdon go in expecting to see theme park based family friendly comic book movie in fact it not like any other batman movies as well it new cinematic experiment with solid story with inspiration drawn from fincher seven and zodiac matt reeves certainly delivered what he promised1.0\tthe batman isn following the trend we see in your day to day superhero movie no it bold and captivating masterpiece that reaches into batman origins to push toward the central narrative there of course plenty of action to play with but it the mystery surrounding the corruption for the truth of gotham city that takes headline of the stage the mood in this movie is dark and grim and placed in world with all the darkness all the shadows and overwhelmed by rain it puts goth back in gotham city this movie really shows us terrifying batman with manifestation of the pain and inner drive he feels towards not letting the past repeat itself this is truly the origins of the character in detective comics and something we haven seen and fully realized on big screen before or at least not with this as main focus this movie is almost hours long though and somehow felt disturbed for everything left out of the movie almost makes me feel like this movie could have been better explored deeply in mini series instead of making us sit on the edge of the seat waiting for the next one actually say that the biggest flaw of this masterpiece is matt reeves the director knowing this wasn standalone movie but rather batman it the silent after the title we don see yet that bothers me apart from my little tantrum for small detail the hours is something to bear in mind of even the biggest fan of the batman could have hard time watching such long film in my opinion this film is right up there with the best of the genre and there are only few comic book films that believe are worthy of being called best picture of the year and personally think that the batman will certainly be among the best it one of my favorite films based on comic book character since joker back in 2019 but only this being the first of new potential trilogy time will tell if matt reeves can continue this streak of amazing film making1.0\twow this is some good mystery thriller take on superhero this movie is more about batman than bruce wayne unlike previous movies where wayne also had equal part in some ways think matt reeves took inspiration from nolan the dark knight and riddler was behaving like nolan joker kidnapping people killing them and then asking for the batman the same way joker did even joker considered himself to be connected with batman in some ways and riddler also thinks the same know know it all in the comics but still think the dark knight was also huge inspiration for this movie it really good movie with top notch direction cinematography music and acting from everyone watch it on the biggest screen possible and you won be disappointed1.0\tthe batman did depart from the formula of superhero films and instead decided to branch out into neo noir detective film and must say it did almost succeed the film is not what you would usually expect from batman film as it is much slower with lot of dialogue and aspects of the plot which seem unnecessary however they amalgamate into the main plot while this did keep the film suspenseful one could see how this could be off putting the pacing was decent however at times it felt quite boring and was left wondering whether certain scenes should have been cut out as they neither aided in the plot nor the character development however the boredom was short lived as the intermittent action scenes drew you back in while the film was three hours long the suspense and action scenes kept you wishing for more but unfortunately it did seem that despite the long run time the film ended in rather abrupt way part of the reason for this is because even though there was build up it did not culminate into anything substantial and it did seem to end on fizz rather than bang the acting from robert pattison was truly excellent the dark and melancholic bruce wayne was an interesting take on the character which fits very nicely with the setting of the film and from our background knowledge of batman this take on the character will no doubt resonate with fans who truly understand bruce wayne from the comics the acting by colin farrell was remarkable his acting alongside the prosthetics brought the character to life in way which has not been done before the action scenes in the batman were some of the best fight scenes in any batman film there was no shortage of violence however it felt grounded and realistic with the character being set back and few times and meeting resistance the choreography was done very well and the action sequences felt like they had come from the arkham video games while there are many things to praise about this film the dark setting and lack of the otherside of batman did cause frustration as it did feel like the film was jumping from plot point to another with no adhesive to bind everything together break up of the different scenes with some aspects of bruce wayne would no doubt have been welcomed by the audience the lack of bruce wayne was substituted by plot point of selina kyle and while it worked in part many of us just wanted it to be over as it did seem ad nauseam seeing the two meet with not much development from the last meeting overall it was highly enjoyable film and it did do justice to the character we know and love while it was slow burn mystery the last hour did bring everything together making it more of superhero film the ending although anticlimactic did leave the audience wandering with one question what does the future hold for batman0.0\tthis guy pattison can act period overrated like everything else the last decade or two so glad didn waste money to watch this garbage nobody will be rewatching this movie in years to come bet the farm on it1.0\tthis film is an art as crime thriller detective film it great visuals cinematography and background score is too good though length was bit long could ve been shorter robert performance was great so does the other characters specially zoë kravitz paul dauno jeffrey write and collin ferrol but for me still cristian bale and ben affleck portrayed the best version of batman1.0\twhen left the movie felt divided the batman that you get warm and fuzzies from was not here little to no humor existed in this film the action was good but lacked the sensationalism in some ways that was good though like other reviews thought robert pulled it off in the suit but wasn as convinced with his bruce wayne parts the movie is long but definitely worth seeing keep an open mind1.0\trelentlessly dismal with some casting that doesn work and nowhere near as good as the dark knight or batman returns the film delivers some spectacular cinematic moments urge everyone to see it as it deserves an audience but just wish it wasn quite so bleak but folks shouldn care what or others think go and see it please1.0\tit was nice to get back to batman film that goes into exploring what makes batman tick with that in mind can believe am saying it but robert pattinson plays great version of the character from the way he speaks and how he carries himself without speaking he embodies batman bruce wayne phenomenally aside from that the dark tone fits well with this character and his world the aesthetics to depict gotham city was done perfectly and the cast for this film were chosen well this movie really impressed me and would advise any batman fan to go see it even if it hours long1.0\tdc telling you right now give this man his trilogy and don interfere with anything joker masterpiece batman masterpiece both films after interference when being made let these amazing directors carry out their vision batman sw sequels matt reeves apes trilogy godfather trilogy harry potter saga these films are my movies and will forever love the creators of these movies for that they ve done for me and my life1.0\tthis movie exceeded all expectations for batman or even superhero movie say other than logan this is one of the best made superhero movies even as stand alone film it stands out from anything made this year the cinematography really captures the grim and dark reality of gotham that no other movie did character arc and development was something haven seen since logan this movie is outstanding and is must see by anyone who loves something well made1.0\tthink christan bale was best batman until this time when saw the robert pattinson acting of the batman said woww from this time my batman is pattinson batman cinematography was amazing zoe kravitz was incredible too thanks matt reeves for everything0.0\tthe stunts wasn enough or are nothing special where were the gadgets the car is shame it just too long and boring and no action only thing that like was the dark atmosphere was presented good but the vision of the director for batman and his world is wrong and disappointing0.0\tmatt reeves is hack long hours with poorly written script pacing is wack music is wack batman characters have no character except for riddler who seemed to me more like the joker than the riddler reeves just can get anything out of his actors catwoman penguin commissioner gordon no really good performances out of any of them batman is constantly surrounded by cops and accepted as vigilante who just scream and taunt batman what really mad about is that we didn get ben afleck batman movie and replaced what could have been with this movie don understand all of the great reviews just not for me1.0\twhat performance and what movie the music score is breathtaking and the film keeps you on edge throughout with very engaging story will be seeing again asap1.0\tpeak fiction matt take bow robert never doubted for second if you see any of his other work you would already know what this performance would be he is just phenomenal zoe is just as mesmerising what casting this movie lived up to the hype that for sure1.0\tapart from the titular characters overexposure there were two main concerns heading into the batman is it too long are we supposed to think darker edgier batman even cooler batman to the first point yeh probably but in fairnes nothing stands out as obvious filler to be removed and the fact the final act doesn drag on means you end the film feeling your time has been respected as for the second concern the answer is fortunately resounding no nobody understands me batman doesn even understand himself and is wracked by doubts about his actions and effectiveness he is rightly called out for having priveledged person view of crime and the film acknowledges the fact that someone going around beating up street thugs probably wouldn help city very much despite spending the vast majority of the film under the mask pattinson manages to convey enough humanity to get across the idea that bruce is doing his best and isn just violent scumbag and the fact he is portrayed as just man rather than mega genius makes it easier to route for him despite his flaws paul dano is as good as you would expect as the riddler who actually has better understanding of gotham problems than batman but like all channer types doesn have any solutions beyond people must die because my life sucks all this seriousness doesn mean the film completely forgets its comic book movie largely thanks to colin farells scenery chewing penguin who could has strolled right out of dick tracy film and neon red gotham city for the most part the line between comic book and detective noir is walked confidently but there is the occasional slip the grave tone means the absolute incompetence of gothams police sticks out we really aren sending riddler computer for forensics and if you squint at some parts you can almost believe you are watching parody the batman then is very much like its title character serious ambitious in its aims flawed and pretty captivating1.0\tmarvel shmarvel this film is marvel there is no comparison the film is set years after batman was introduced to gotham and what magnificent choice that was he not playboy he not frightened of his calling he not tormented by the death of his parents he lives and breathes the fear he has instilled in gotham criminals is he in the shadows what was that noise we think we ve seen this before but not in this film the audience is terrified that batman may be in the shadows is this another scene where he smashes in criminals faces what are we about to witness he the dark devil in the shadows you will be debilitated if you pick fight you will never be smarter than him you ll never tear down his confidence you will never be stronger than him he is the greatest detective that gotham has ever had that his job he takes his job very seriously and right now there serial killer on the loose let bring in batman he smarter than the rest of us if you re looking for an ounce of charm or wit watch the dark knight series this is no cartoonish betrayal this is no dark knight no tim burton film it is an action film with passion snd brilliance1.0\twas skeptical when saw that robert pattinson was playing batman but boy was wrong to be skeptical he did an amazing job and this film finally brings back the feelings that we all miss from the christian bale movies don know many people that ve been excited about watching the ben affleck batman movies ben affleck is great actor but he just not good at being batman robert pattinson did an amazing job and zoë kravitz crushed it as catwoman hopefully the sequel will be out soon1.0\tthis is the best batman or even comic book movie so far batman is my favorite comic hero and this is by far the best live action batman ever can wait to watch it again it better than the dark knight better than snyder cut justice league better than captain america civil war or avengers endgame it great movie ignor the people crying about the twilight films that robert was in years ago if that your complaint you should be more upset with yourself for knowing him from those movies than you are with him for being in them watch the film1.0\trobert pattison is the last person would ever choose for batman but wow he did amazing and even better than him was paul dano paul dano put on one hell of performance the movie was nearly three hours long but every moment of it was roller coaster kudos to all of the people involved1.0\tevery batman was dark but not that dark liked pattinson christian bale is the best batman he masculinity is something else but liked this introverted batman played by pattison not the best acting tho riddler actor si not that great and andy serkis is just ok nothing more liked michael caine more cinematography was good not better than tdk expected less honestly its gonna be in my top this year for sure1.0\tthis batman is very evocative but not derivative movie there are elements of every batman you can think of visually it nolan aurally it bale the batsuit is burton bruce is jason bourne in his expression the movie itself watches like the arkham games the riddler is kind of longwinded gordon is subdued but still central figure whether thats the writing or geoffrey wright not sure selina is pfeifer berry didnt really need her but she didnt hurt the final product gotham is dark knight rises the plot feels like it would be great batman 66 movie at nearly hours long what this mashup wasnt is boring enjoyed the movie and was entertained will watch this again as faithfully as watch batman 661.0\thad negative omissions for this film at first because of the casting of actors but just saw this movie and was infinitely prevailed until the moon was born by the film hour advantage by its bee knees in combat and setup robert pattinson spent whole decade finding the right fang props for his minion bats on set after relinquishing his incommodious vampire pairs from twilight1.0\theadline speaks for itself attended fan screening tonight at 30pm and it was very good better than the others that do the same rinse and repeat origin story or have him fight superman for waste of movie0.0\tthis was frustratingly boring the pacing the dialogue the plot all just plodded on and on with only the faintest whiff of intrigue there was no reason to care about any of these characters or what would happen to them or to gotham had zero emotional connection to anyone in this film and the was not spark of chemistry between any of the actors anywhere the director managed to sap out all the suspense from the story and even the stunts and car chases were boring shot and edited in such way that it was hard to tell what was happening at times sure looked expensive though yeesh0.0\tcouldn tell the timeline the cinematography looked 80s 90s but had iphones and modern cars couldn tell between batman and bruce wayne the true character is batman and the fake character is bruce wayne we got the same character for both too much pc batman fights the bad guys this movie showed him just as equal as the bad guys it got too much into reality with the whole politics thing movie was well made and colin farrell knocked it out of the park1.0\tthe first two acts of this film were what you would hope for out of superhero noir the third act was bit of flop almost wonder if wb stepped in and tinkered with things as they ve been known to do pattinson is great batman the cast in general is fantastic one of the better batman adaptations in long time and happy to have seen it hopefully there will be more cohesive director cut with better third act0.0\tnever write reviews but this is the worst movie have ever seen and not picky it was incredibly dull and boring the action scenes are filmed at weird angles and makes it hard to actually see what going on the acting is terrible only the penguin is good but is hardly in any scenes the plot is so mediocre really didn care what happened just wanted it to end hours of my life ll never get back what waste of time and money0.0\tboring the riddle doesn seem he psychopath genius or smart failed makeover make up acting and robbert pattinson has pretty boy characteristic and turns into gloomy characteristic and losing his best characters the entire scene has 70 75 close up of batman the story is quite boring the ending doesnt gave us worth to wait ending0.0\twell hours of dark blurry uninspiring and not memorable fights and moments with an old telltale game based story liked his car other gadgets are non existing actually and the batman character is ok bruce wayne however is just wannabe bruce wayne spoiled brat with too much money as for me my doubts aboat pattinson choice were right maybe ve seen too much batman movies already but thanks no thanks to this1.0\tdc finally has the hero it deserves on this occasion matt reeves is the actual hero dc needs this type of hero after nolan departure we got everything we expect in batman movie the brilliant writing crisp editing phenomenal cinematography haunting bgm with nirvana something in the way sound track last but not list the amazing portrayal of each character by the stellar cast it is no exaggeration to say that this is the best superhero movie in recent times1.0\tvengence new batman detective movie offers very good adaptation of batman comics like batman background voice in the scene is telling what going on in his mind batman is still struggling with the death of his parent makes mistakes still learning the way movies have been shot is incredible off course the movie has lots of black colours and that what special about the batman movie is all about no doubt about the acting everyone delivers their best the movie keeps you engaging with suspense and screenplay but you will find its slow pace and long movie if you are expecting the actions it doesn offer you much1.0\tthis film is at the head of the class when it comes to creating unique story while also pulling inspiration from not only specific comics but also history and even games its so hard to articulate how good batman movie and drama this is the score the acting the plot its all so awesome this might be the best bat we ve seen on screen1.0\tit the first time ve seen batman movieit still feels pretty good although there are some places where the film is quite depressing but the scene is very spectacular the music effect is also very good very substitutive1.0\tbatman one of the best movies ever or in 2022 atleast it was so good so onpoint could see batman as detective also as human also as having all the cool gadgets but he yet to develop them the story came together so nicely vengeance to hope still need to figure out the maroni falcon saga but so help me god have thoroughly enjoyed this movie1.0\tchristopher nolan the dark knight is the standard for all batman movies what made his movies work so well is the audience was invested in bruce wayne however in the batman bruce wayne hardly has any screen time likewise it hard to become emotionally involved with robert pattinson bruce wayne because we hardly know him with that said when we did see bruce wayne it seemed rather obvious to me he was batman unlike christian bale batman who acted the part of rich spoiled billionaire robert patterson had the same mannerism as bruce wayne and batman the riddler is the main villain but you don get much screen time with him either certainly nothing like heath ledger joker or tom hardy bane however loved this version of the penguin he very believable and scary as one of gotham top crime lords job well done by colin farrell zoë kravitz does decent job as catwoman but nothing like anne hathaway who knocked it out of the park no doubt this is perhaps the darkest batman yet mostly night scenes and its constantly raining overall the action scenes were well done the new bat mobile is bad ass oddly enough just started watching the tv series gotham and thought this movie was natural extension of that show it good batman movie worth seeing but it not in the same class as the dark night by any stretch of the imagination1.0\tmy most anticipated film of the year didn disappoint currently writing this an hour since left the cinema and already booking to go back something never do so let start with the simple details the runtime is three hours long but it never skips beat every scene pays off in the end and comes to brilliant climax while think it may be to do with recency bias believe this could be my personal favourite batman film which has finally topped batman 1989 and batman begins all the cast here are brilliant and no one feels out of place in their role the standout for me was zoe kravitz as selina kyle catwoman she steals the show and was perfect in every scene she in robert pattinson is brilliant batman and in the few scenes he has as bruce wayne in particular the funeral scene the antagonists here are fantastic too paul dano is miles better than jim carey rendition with this one actually feeling like genuine threat who revels in his intelligence and sadistic nature we also have the penguin who is played by colin farrell and he great too he is revolting but in great way and it always unsettling when he on screen the musical score is perfect too with the main theme being really striking the plot of this film is quite simple with string of murders being done by the riddler but it really works the first half of this film felt like detective noir and it nice to focus on batman being the worlds greatest detective instead of just hurting criminals the batman is the film to beat this year and even if you aren batman fan watch this film1.0\tdifferent take on the batman character more based around the detective and less superhero did enjoy it although the movies is unnecessarily long guess it because of the long shade that the dark knight trilogy leaves that it just doesn quite generate the same emotions worth the watch though1.0\thad my doubts initially being that most live action dc movies recently haven been good but really liked this pattinson does great job and the rest of the cast are great also good timing good runtime for the story looking forward to seeing more pattinson led batman movies1.0\tis soo good its dark and has everything batman movie need to have love how everything lldkkdkdlddmdmldlddlldldldldldldkdkkdkdkdkdkdkkdkdkdkdkkd1.0\twhich was good thing because this isn super hero movie caveat haven seen batman since before the nolan this worked for me because the story made sense the villains were believable with the master criminal element mixed in with some mafioso subterfuge it dark and brooding not overly violent the bat has been behind the mask two years and works with jim gordon some cops don like this so he still establishing himself and who he is and has little am doing more harm than good vibe if you needed to know anything about any other movie couldn tell so rpats in the mask is striking batman interesting backstory on the wayne parents so if you re passerby on the story fills in some holes it not the exact same wayne story knew liked that his delivery as both bruce bat was cool fights looked good and weren overdrawn adding to the reality of it it not an interstellar or super power villain it mystery pretty straightforward murder happens bat investigates he asks questions and we re off into the layers of gothams seedy underbelly selena kyle has personal connection of her own to the crime and yes the ballyhooed chemistry between them is thing you want to see if it could go somewhere the riddler is creepy but not on screen for too long his ending doesn answer everything clearly which you ll like the batman is too long that said the first hours really clipped along for me it sets itself up nicely for at least more of rp wants to0.0\tdon know what everyone is on about on here but this movie is drawn out with poor cinematography the new batman is way too over the top with him being some wise serious dude it just seems like the whole movie batman is trying really hard to be batman and his fighting style is poor and plain tedious to watch with this movie being about 10 minutes of fights and and half hours of long drawn out heartfelt speeches it left me waiting for the movie to end0.0\tlong boring lazy soundtrack nothing new come on dc you have some amazing characters but you don seem to know what to do with them other than endless reboots guess will have to wait for the next reboot to see decent batman movie at least we have the dark knight to remember that batman movie can be awesome1.0\tintro scene excellent bgm outstanding action outstanding wanted more ending excellent cinematography excellent the batman is not vengeance he is more than that1.0\tthis batman film gives us good understanding of what bruce wayne is really like this is very dark gripping and suspenseful batman this movie gives us good understanding of what he has become it shows us the detective style of batman batman is darker than he ever been the score the cinematography acting and robert pattinson performance is truly amazing in this film everyone has been waiting almost two years for this film to come out and let me just tell you this film and disappoint this film is up there with the dark knight what black and blue and dead all over paul dano performance as the ridler was amazing colin farrell penguin truly amazing zoe kravitz cat woman unbelievably amazing matt reeves did good acting choice batman noir style in the dark gritty gotham was an absolute hit0.0\thonestly had high hopes for this movie with cast like this and the promotional material they put out it seemed like this would be another great entry in the live action batman catalogue boy was wrong the movie wanted to be big and important just ask giacchino score it tells you everything the movie wanted to convey the problem is the movie is shot and written as an intimate thriller it didn open up until the 3rd act and you remember that gotham isn just made up of few business men some politicians mobster or two and police force for movie that talks about how much the common man has been wronged you don really hear or care much about them until it convenient for the plot acting was average and even above average in lot cases as batman film built around the conceit of the dark knight his accompanying rogues and gotham it one than the dark knight trilogy which still believe to be stellar movie but more of an action movie with batman skin the batman however is far inferior film to even few of the 1990s batman movies it didn know when to take itself seriously and when to play things little lighter and make joke found myself laughing at poorly written dialogue just to relieve some of the unrelenting gloom of the nearly hour flick this is one of the few movies ll probably never watch again1.0\tnearly didn go to see this film because of the poor first views what film did they see just seen it in imax and blown away so powerful so glade went love the batman trilogy this is on another level and completely different film patterson is great finally seeing his ability he was good in tenet great in this goose bumps all over when the batmobile starts up for the first time have to say don miss it in imax was glued didn even notice it was 3hrs go and see it0.0\tthere wasn story or let say good story the bat mobile was just car alot of silence and nothing nothing very disappointed of this movie like batman dark night was good movie or began that was awesome but this one smfh let down bad let down1.0\thonestly really enjoyed this movie would like to give 10 visually it was beautiful feast for the eyes these lights the colors are wonderful another aspect that definitely stood out as plus was the music which in my opinion perfectly suited the atmosphere of the movie the movie is dark and the atmosphere would be perfect for david fincher it is pity that he did not direct this movie would definitely recommend seeing the batman in the cinema for those effects and colors some of the shots are really dreamlike however the ending leaves the question will there be another part1.0\tthis film left me stupefied loved every single second of it and the dark atmosphere mixed with detective genre make it very good content acting is amazing too with pattinson never disappointing me since started to re evaluate him and paul dano who deserves more attention for his incredible power to make hate the characters he plays and the riddler was perfect for someone like him matt reeves for me gave us an interesting material attached with sparkling feelings didn feel since the dark knight1.0\tthis is what want to see from dc more please very good story originally did not like the bat man suit in the trailers but after watching the movie it grown on me and the sound track was amazing1.0\tfrom writer director matt reeves who already has proved his mettle with films like the ape series and cloverfield he takes things up notch in this an edgy action packed thriller that depicts batman in his early years struggling to balance rage with righteousness as he investigates disturbing mystery that has terrorized gotham robert pattinson delivers raw intense portrayal of batman as disillusioned desperate vigilante awakened by the realization that the anger consuming him makes him no better than the ruthless serial killer he hunting the bgm always kicks the right emotions and aspirations of the characters portrayed on the screen the score by michael giacchino simply soars at the right moments which in turn increases the intensity of the scenes much more this is the most grounded take on batman yet in the history of dc and for the same reason it is amongst the best outing of the iconic character yet well if tdk had heath ledger going for it so is paul dano here as riddler know there is no comparison for them both both of them were phenomenal in their respective roles which only adds to the factor of both the movies personally liked tdk better than this one for some reason but this one comes quite close and even better in some areas well wb haven revealed any sequels planned for this one but know they will have to after this one crushes the box office with praise coming from both critics and fans alike talking about the performances of everyone here think zoe kravitz was outstanding as selina kyle and colin farrel penguin was simply hilarious for the most part jeffery wright famous for playing bernard in westworld as gordon was an excellent choice and he did justice with his role as well this is the darkest creepiest and most riveting tale of the cape crusader yet so much so that you could think you are in batman horror movie which stays true to its source material batman the long halloween the hour runtime might be problem for some added on top of it the slow burnesque crime thriller which only suits few but for me it was ball to watch it on the big screen go watch it already guys this one is gonna divide fans amongst who is the goat but trust me there is more to it than meets the eye whole lot of easter eggs and comic book references verdict1.0\tthis was fantastic retelling of batman that stay true the original comics while blending perfectly with modern story telling and times lines batman is the worlds greatest detective and this movie brings that fact back into the story don miss this while it theatre the 4x experience blended well with the over all performance1.0\tlet get this out of the way robert pattinson is an excellent batman please let him do this role for any batman movie in the next decades then the movie itself it was really great and tense for the first hours but then you notice that they need to make an end and then you notice that the story is all wrong couple of things the main villain is the riddler obviusly he performed is actions but he is frustrated at the end why also what was his goal what did he want to achieve with this this is entirely unclear also batman has no influence on the actions of the riddler if batman was not in this movie everything still would happen as it happened the only thing that batman intervened in was prohibiting mobdter from being killed by catwoman so that mobster would be killed minutes later by someone else also the final act was hilarious set pieces bad guys positioned themselves on the single most dumbest location possible people were fleeing to the single most dumbest location possible all for dramatic effect but after hours of great cinema it felt like the writers were swapped with amateurs ve read some good comments about the car chase scene but also this scene was totally unnecessary after capturing the bad guy they just leave him after they spoke with him and instead of ruining the highwat with the reckless chase they could have looked him up in his establishment the next morning summarized the first two hours are amazingly tense and great cinema but the last 45 minutes make you realize it was all for nothing no pay off no motive no role in the story for batman so have to give it just1.0\tthere something biblically beautiful about this film given the way everything ties up at the end prior to its release everything matt reeves had promised about the batman made me more and more enthusiastic about it and all the news and behind the scenes seemed to hold so much possibilities but admittedly was bit scared about it at the same time well matt delivered on his promises and am grateful for that the movie is absolutely astonishing in every aspect everything seemed like it was thought out and was as matt intended it to be it completely floored me gotham has never before felt completely rundown they really hammer home the point that gotham is hellhole on earth people can possibly survive in place such as this hence true paradise for criminals from its gothic architecture to its rain soaked streets and even its people gotham seems to have character of its own the cinematography is another thing that couldn get enough of throughout the experience was captivated by its beauty and became completely immersed in it scenes are lit in certain way and especially the way the light falls on the batman greig fraser really outdid himself this time around he contributed to the realization of this version of batman and then some michael giacchino as always does his job brilliantly his music composition here really compliments the film after they dropped the new batman theme before clicking on it wondered what could possibly be different once did hear it though was like okay this is actually good and it grew on me as listened was curious to find out how it would play out in scenes have to admit it blends in so seamlessly whenever it is used one of the highlights of the movie for me is the relationship between gordon and batman they are like true partners both in the gutter fighting for the same thing you can sense they both rely on each and have mutual respect homie goals with jeffrey wright in the role you can go wrong the guy is brilliant and he plays gordon wonderfully his gordon might be my favorite version of the character zoë kravitz as catwoman is something wasn initially sure of but she has sold me with her feline like walking long nails slyness alluring quality that not only appears believable but also adds to the character that she portrays thought she and alfred were the heart of the movie that brings me to the character of alfred played by andy serkis who is really good in the role my only gripe with the movie lies with alfred not having much screen time my boy colin farrell steals every scene he in he completely disappears in the role of penguin paul dano riddler is surprisingly nothing like the riddler we re used to this time he stripped off all of his silly and campy aspect he is scary and sadistic to the point that was creeped out several times while watching really liked what they did with riddler here robert pattinson batman is vastly different from anything we ve seen in live action pattinson portrays the character as recluse restrained tethered to the trauma of his past always brooding and discontented for not being able to do enough since he devotes most of his time to being vengeance his night and day blur together he has not yet been able to distinguish between bruce wayne and batman he rarely speaks in this film and appears to be constantly observing as if he on the outside looking in trying to connect with what has been lost however when he puts on the cowl and all he exhibits fear like no other it was thrilling to watch how his presence was being perceived by everyone around him also liked how at times even batman himself starts to question his purpose whether he fighting losing battle he has whole arc and by the time the film ends he seems to have grasp of what he needs to become for his city cannot stress enough how much loved what matt and pattinson did with the character they made this already deeply damaged character even more damaged and vulnerable there room left for more to do with the character can think of anything that bothered me much love that scenes are really drawn out and how it takes its time setting up the mood also love how batman is investigating case rather than just beating people up and occasionally he makes mistakes finally film that gets the character right though know many people have issues with the third act like how it all comes together and ends on hopeful note think it inescapable that it would be compared with the tdk trilogy because let be honest nolan set the bar how realistic comic book characters can be however it is foolish to disregard either filmmaker efforts at bringing the characters we all love to life just because you prefer one over the other as for where place the batman still unsure but for the time being it just beside the dark knight one thing sure of is that it is the perfect batman film it the one we didn know we needed but the one we absolutely deserve it proves yet again that comic book movies can be more than just entertainment1.0\tnothing is original anymore it had great sound effects and sound but it the same batman story line that has always been around suppose you could say it stayed true to the batman story line however when batman is made 20 times it hard to set yourself apart from the others1.0\tthe batman is the darkest possible thriller detective film and is the perfect fresh start away from the formulaic happy usual superhero films however the darkness will cause lot of controversy especially with critics it is filled with amazing spectacle and the cinematography will be nominated for oscars robert pattinson turns down all the hater because he will be nominated too he barely speaks but you can see his pain and suffering all on his face the chemistry with zoe is brilliant and colin farrell is so underated he plays the penguin so well of course the haunted paul danos riddler is the zodiac killer incarnation and perfect horror serial killer the movie differ from any other superhero film and that what is great about it it is realistic while still being loyal to the comics action scenes and car chases make you want to stand up and cheer matt reeves has produced unique masterpiece exceeding all superhero movies other than the dark knight not sure that will ever be topped but certainly hope so in the sequel1.0\tthis is the batman you ve wanted for so long we need sequel this movie is art matt reeves and the team killed it must see batman is back guys1.0\tthis movie is deserves more than ratings robert pattinson the batman is worth watching it all about riddles and background score is an outstanding watched this movie on theater and was felt like watching horror movie die hard fan of batman and ve never see in previous batman but this batman director matt reeves brings lot of new things in this movie zoe kravitz and paul dano colin farrell all other characters played best acting this is going to be my favorite batman movie robert appearance in this movie is very very unique story line is amazing but it more darker movie but over movie deserves now is worth to spend hours on theater no doubt1.0\tgotham needs batman as much as batman needs gotham robert pattinson plays the role of an almost suicidal bruce wayne to perfection there nothing in his life that makes him happy all he wants to do is be batman and solve the puzzles lying in front him which is ironic given the main theme of the movie is him figuring out what the riddler is trying to achieve the distractions are obvious but bruce is unaware of the real danger being himself and his doomed mission of vengeance brilliant performances all around by the cast and here hoping for the sequel to be even better0.0\tboahhh always good trying something new bit too sinister to me and after this dooom dom dom boring music with sleepy choral lyrics really tired me so left the cinema not bad movie but definetly no rating and not my type of batman1.0\tll start by saying that the dark knight still remains the best batman movie having said that this is completely new take on batman as promoted they do give us batman who is very human new to his batman thing so still learning having all the gadgets and toys but none as refined as batbale or batfleck the actors do their part the best way it can be done pattinson gives us nothing to complain about as he delivers very young sharp energetic and angry batman and flawed bruce wayne who is still to find his balance in both the lives he is living paul dano riddler is menacing and john turturro is good as always zoe is ok as catwoman colin farrell is marvelous as penguin as it impossible to find the real him in that character all in all great movie the only thing was disappointed was that they didn show the full potential of that bat suit no spoilers here but you ll know1.0\treally everything batman fan can wish for reeves understands batman on such crazy level that impressive you feel that he is truly comic fan this movie is very well written very well written acted and just overall one of the best movies of the last 10 years1.0\ttake this as an honest movie review the batman had everything good movie needs action adventure and mystery as well as touch of suspense as well as few moments of comedy in this film batman seems more isolated and alone like rich vigilante would probably be and his outfit seemed like it was home made which kept true to the original idea of batman that bob kane came up with truly great detective movie after all dc does stand for detective comics1.0\twas kind of worried about the casting of the batman but it was the best movie for dc hope there is sequel in the future thank you matt reeves also pattinson is the perfect batman0.0\tthree hours of director who found cool camera shot and or technique and subjected the audience to his discovery found sitting through this movie to be squeaky chalk on chalkboard continuously for three hours ouch my eyes are blurry after watching that film1.0\twas originally going to give this but upon reflection this film was so well crafted it would have been an insult to do so the batman had the daunting task of matching the quality of its former predecessors most notably the dark knight trilogy however matt reeves proceeded to produce monumental superhero movie which challenges the concept of batman producing the most psychotic unhinged bruce wayne we have seen in the modern era character so we ll crafted by robert pattinson that the likes of christian bale edition have been surpassed in many areas not only does pattinson batman stand out as an exceptional take on the character but he further engulfs gritty edition of gotham providing moving tense atmosphere for the entirety of the film present day city which it hopelessness gravitates the task the batman faces against evil and corruption none of this is possible without the breathtaking cinematography produced in the film something which makes this edition of batman film one of the best in its history what stops this film being 10 10 however was the story no doubt the first two thirds of the film were faultless building up mastermind of riddler against batman not so gifted in intelligence compared to his prior portrayals pathing way for what should have been an ending of epic proportions where the story failed however was it failure to match the grit and dystopia of the world around it this notably applies to the story unwillingness to kill off certain characters which would have correlated with the mercilessnesses of the enemies the batman faces and furthermore the end sequences felt as if they did not achieve the time they required to propel the film action to epic proportions this was not helped by the monotonous aspect of the film score regardless of how striking it may have been in its early features in scenes regardless this film is most certainly must watch with all acting performances bringing reeve edition of the batman to larger than life three hours with the hope of future sequels we may potentially look back on this film as exceeding its predecessors with ease however in its current standalone form cannot warrant that achievement the future is certainly exciting for dc and the batman has made statement to the marvel hegemon of superhero movies1.0\tthe batman is one of the most visually stunning movies have ever seen this movie was dark and gritty just like it needed to be loved that we followed the mystery with batman gotham has never looked so bad in good way instantly fell in love with the supporting cast from jim gordon to the penguin zoë kravitz is perfect as selina kyle and equally as impressive paul dano is twisted take on the riddler matt reeves has delivered masterpiece with the batman and can wait to see what happens in our next adventures with the caped crusader1.0\tthis was great superhero movie robert pattinson did an amazing job the fights were great but the movie just felt like it should have been rated nonetheless every scene did it job in amazing storytelling this was not your typical batman movie1.0\tignore the bad reviews as they probably are just angrey batman fans that lost it when they heard the term white privilege in the movie said by the catwoman although think hour of lenght might scare someone who isn found of superhero movies it could be half an hour shorter with some right trimming it is well balanced movie of this kind in terms of action scenes and slower scenes the bruce here is definitely emo but thats cuz he younger in this story and that fits very well with his characterization lonely 20 something billionaire living on his bubble with too much time and money to spare and vendetta against crime it fun to see this bruce world crumble as the movie passes and that on pattinson acting wich is precisely low key blasé as bruce and chaotic as batman the thing is it feels like very different experience watching at the cinema and at home it felt more exciting and beliveable at the cinema specially the riddler character and the third act the batman is definitely worth watching best if you got audiovisual room that enhances the theather feel0.0\thours this movie dragged on rubbish acting rubbish story line any review rating over must be joke how can you seriously say the acting was well done or the storyline was even thing multiple times it felt like the end and wow that was the best feeling but no let now waste another 20 minutes of your life then bam let do it again with another spin and some more horrrrrrible acting he is the worst batman have ever seen as batman fan this ruins it for me and many others the rating on this site is an absolute joke and not at all what many fans are thinking1.0\tpattinson nailed the haunted dark batman trying to find himself fantastic movie and closer to the source material than the christopher nolan trilogy0.0\tdon understand why the people who keep making excuses for the things they didn like in this film didn just do the same with bvs or mos nobody cared about character development or wanted to know what drove batman to the state he was in in bvs even though it would ve been way more interesting we know where this trilogy is going and we have seen it 10 times already except this time is bit darker if this was actually explored like it was originally supposed to be in the snyderverse you would ve seen the most in depth complex and interesting batman you could think of eventually teaming up and interacting with the rest of the justice league and taking on actual serious threats but now we ve got to go through another solo batman trilogy before we get anything like that anyone can put on batman suit and pretend to be batman literally anyone even the very young kid in gotham did good job of being angry batman mode bruce wayne1.0\tuniquely captivating and raw take on the batman we all know where the dark knight and others have been overwhelmingly fast paced and action packed this movie slows the tempo dims the lights and takes you on gritty ride through gotham the production quality here was truly exceptional stunning shots and scenery throughout perfectly paired with an amazing score from michael giacchino seriously the soundtrack was sensational and can imagine it won have shot at winning best original score in next year oscars can remember the last movie score that stood out to me like this one did didn know what to expect from pattinson in his role as batman but he was surprisingly effective as was kravitz and paul dano very well casted storyline had some great depth to it and the way it comes together in the latter half of the movie made the movie can say enjoyed it quite as much as the dark knight heath ledger performance alone tips the scale for me but objectively almost everything about the batman is done equally as well with certain elements being even better just not as much my cup of tea by all means great movie and one that makes the recent marvel films look like child play we need more of this1.0\twow won give any spoilers but what matt reeves and robert pattinson did here was just amazing went into this movie with high expectations after reading many reviews and even with that was still impressed and surprised at how amazing it truly was blown away by the acting the story and the characters and will be going back right away to see it again1.0\tas the title suggests this is the batman have been waiting for the worlds greatest detective dark frightening this is what have wanted from batman as long as can remember will admit bruce wayne is not as interesting as batman but luckily he only bruce for only roughly 20 minutes of the movie bruce is okay here and you get the feeling that he really struggling to keep the two separate but when he batman the rest of the film oh man this is what batman is all about fear desperation darkness it all here must admit when found out it was pg 13 rating was disappointed was hoping for our first rated batman but after seeing the film can happily say it still delivered and forgot the rating if you truly know and respect the mythos of batman you will love this movie the group of eight went with was on the edge of their seat the whole time looks like they set us up for more and pleas give us more1.0\tfantastic movie 10 out of 10 for me absolutely worth the wait every character was portrayed brilliantly hats to everyone who worked on the film at dc credit to the art of movie making mr pattinson you nailed it as the batman1.0\thave seen all the batmans many many times this might be my favorite did raise brow at pattinson as bruce wayne but he an amazing actor in everything and this was great perfect mix of old and new it brought back that dark noir feeling bit long but loved that no rushing the story it was awesome1.0\tthe batman is poetic character development story with brilliant beginning mystery filled but little dragged mid body and beautiful ending it is very different batman movie and is slow burn in shakespeare style flow as opposed to this the nolan movies especially tdk feels like bullet train without brakes with plot points in constant motion tdk is essentially crime thriller whereas the batman is mix of various genres with main ingredients of mystery noir and action and pinch of horror love story and trace of humour matt reeves has put so many genres in one movie and blended it so well it really shows the batman is all about realisation and character development of bruce wayne as batman it the most realistic gotham if the comic gotham were city in real life as opposed to nolan gotham where it was realistic but not gotham it was like any other city with crime the movie shows what it would look like vigilante comes into real city the movie drips with gorgeous shots one after the other with some scenes that set it apart the scenes immerse you in the city and the story buildup leads to one of the most realistic threats batman has faced it like blend of graphic novels and reality there are soooooo many refrences to characters from the batman universe it through and through passion project the only issue which believe is the pacing in the detective part which believe has to be slow since it is detective part but it feels too long sometimes other than that there editing issue at the end one part of the ending should ve been kept as post credit scene which feel matt reeves didn do since he didn want to copy the marvel trend other than this the film score acting the chemistry between all the actors and boy oh boy riddlers voice is just gritty brilliance the dark knight has very bleak message and very indirect growth of the titular character whereas the batman feels personal take on his character development and beautiful payoff at the end rate it 101.0\tso watched the batman glad saw it first day on the first showing because although there was little disturbance with few phones and whispers overall not too bad the film itself is good very much enjoyed it the whole cast is incredible especially colin farrell who just simply disappears into the role of the penguin robert pattinson proves to be an excellent batman with his portrayal being one of brimming anger youthful intensity and still getting to grips after being truly tested for the first time as batman thought he was great the film narrative and story really strongly takes influence from se7en which is fantastically new and fresh take on batman more akin to the comics and graphic novels in it dark disturbing and violent portrayal filmmaking wise it to me feels like an odd mixture of se7en silence of the lambs and john wick with influences borrowed from the dark knight yet still it felt fully original and unique just as great filmmaking should be however did feel the first half of the movie was better than the second half and the final act seems to me to just go too far away from it serial killer thriller vibe into more traditional superhero territory which didn really understand and frankly was disappointed with it didn feel like three hour film which is always positive however didn feel the film fully justified it length but overall great batman film and really liked it0.0\thours is long time for not really taking any chances collin ferrell was good guess boring scenes with alfred isn enough don dig the emo batman vibe either1.0\tkudos to matt reeves for directing this masterpiece can wait for the sequel robert pattinson nailed it and so does everyone else the casting for this movie is on the spot paul dano as the riddler was so good already watched it twice and still can get enough one of the best batman movie ever made1.0\tmatt reeve vision and execution were amazing the riddler who villainy you question the catwoman as realistic portrayal of an anti hero the penguin preparing to rise as big name in the city and batman who mask is truly bruce wayne absolutely loved how much it felt like we were watching comic and you could see clear insprarions and attention to detail but not giving it 10 because it was slightly too long pace was slow at to build at first we didn get to to see the range patz has shown in the amazing films he done since finishing twilight good time devil all the time high life etc but again get that it was the vision and true to the comic just could have done with touch more light and shade loved it and want to watch it again1.0\tthe film is extremely well done but wouldn recommend for the typical superhero movie going crowd the film doesn have jokes that give time between each piece of dialogue for the audience to laugh there weren many moments where everyone was clapping the movie keeps your attention but in return you must focus on the movie recommend seeing it with one person or by yourself before seeing with friends great movie though action packed and balanced with great dialogue and moments of rest while never stopping the momentum also stands as the most like batman comic out of all batman movies we ve received very well made and planning on seeing at least 30 more times in theaters1.0\tif you were second guessing robert pattinson for this role think you ll be pleasantly surprised fantastic job bringing the infamous character back to the big screen and the story line was just as good say with plot details comparable to zodiac 2007 this film is sure to keep you hooked in great movie 101.0\twith new direction from matt reeves he saved batman and dc from falling after mischances in the last 10 years the movie was shocking for me with the best action scenes have never watched in batman movies reeves used his way of directing his movie with static camera in action scenes the realism of acting and screenplay paul dano gave the best second role after there will be blood he terrified me many times the movie was mixed between other movies like the dark knight trilogy joker 2019 taxi driver noir films and more even mixed between comics like batman year one the long halloween and batman earth one the makeup artist gave me the best looking that have never seen before like robert pattinson zoe kravitz especially colin ferrell the worst thing in the movie for me was catwoman there was no problem with zoe kravitz acting but the screenplay mixed her feeling between hard events and show her sexiness and unfortunately the villain didn appear as much should appearing dc is on the right way the suicide squad and the batman were satisfied movies for me0.0\thonestly sat and sat to find positive but could not sorry story is terrible script is terrible acted terrible cast terrible and directed terrible1.0\tthe batman movie is totally different from ordinary superheroes movies brue wayne our batman will look in dectective mode he is very brutal for his enemies he is not so experience so he make several mistake but also learn from it he always has some guilt people in gatum feel afaird from him more than feel safe our batman want to make peace in gatum city which it his main aim riddler will say one of the best villain exposed corruption in gatum city in front of batman and how many big people connected to it even thomas wayne also action sence in movie is okay but movie offered you thriller suspense and good story line at last not forget to see joker1.0\tthis is film that breaks out of and redefines the classic superhero movie with beautiful cinematographey realistic palpable personalities and gripping mystery this movie is one could rewatch over and over again the longer am detached from this movie the more appreciate it is there conflict yes bad guy plenty but the narrative isn so simple you get to experience unravel the thrill of mystery that is worthy of batman title worlds greatest detective the growth of his character and understanding of what it means to be hero is also refreshing he isn just born standout hero with perfect morals nor does he begin his hero work with perfect approach in many ways we get to see him move from chaotic good to heroic justice so much could say but all in all this film takes vengeance on the superhero genre is it perfect film can say could you make it better don know if you could without compromising other aspects that why gave it 10 101.0\tgreat great movie it more of thriller with batman in it loved the directing and the cast the movie has some very iconic shots pattinson gives probably the best portrayal of batman ve seen so far in the movies love how weird and antisocial he is as bruce wayne he hasn been bruce wayne since his parents died he is only in his comfort zone when he wears the cowl and cape during one scene when something happens when he is bruce wayne you can just see him altering his whole demeanor and he just switches into batman mode right away ve never seen an actor do this so brilliantly mean the previous actors where all good in their own way but pattinson makes both characters come to life and really become one really liked the riddler as well it easy to mess up this character but think they just about nailed the real edward its not marvel movie with loads of action and lots of humor they are great as well but batman is no superhero this is true batman movie0.0\ttldr costuming and casting choices distract from the movie throughout changes to the classic formula lose important heritage batman is not as buff as he should be he just come out of years of training in nanda parbat where he would be extremely buff fit and with many scars here he just very average looking with no story telling of what he been through he doesn look like he could beat up criminals any more than anyone else batman cowl pulls up at the corners around his cheekbone giving strange feminine shape to it this does not pair well with the newer slimmer bat look batman gear was too low tech this is man with limitless wealth in other media this is shown with his tech but here this aspect is sacrificed and the bruce and batman characters are weaker for it an example is his cape he can fly with it and has one single use wingsuit the overall colour palette is boring and repetitive always around sixty percent black in frame frames are constantly warm in tone never shifting to cool like they should for example in the iceberg lounge the iceberg lounge is icy in name alone it should have blue and white elements and be themed club the arkham games show this well the penguin lives here so of course it has to feel like an iceberg instead its generic dark and boring to look at in the club the music was too quite it didn interfere with character dialogue and characters weren straining to communicate even in the main room riders whole character was poor rider is the original gotham city criminal an old guy with plenty of wisdom from which to base his riddles he likes green and he has cane here they ve done away with all of that making him around the same age as batman himself making him somewhat pudgy no green no cane he looks like computer science major his mask is like catwoman cheap low effort disguise it shows no respect to the character heritage catwoman has lost her big red goggles this was an iconic part of here character appearance as well as practical eye protection her hat barely has ears and is cheap woolen beanie it looks like low effort halloween costume have no issues with the actor herself she did quite well with what see was given she too different to who catwoman is though would have been better to cast her as whole new character the bat cave was not even cave but an underground railway station this makes access to it easier and more logical but that also makes it less secure in the past the batcave has always shown dichotomy between batman ultra high tech again not visually present and the natural basic elements of cave it is symbol of the relationship between bruce wane and batman setting this one in train station and dumbing down the high tech look defeats this visual relationship the soundtrack is short and repetitive the same phrase making an appearance in way too many fight scenes genuine song with lyrics is used early in the film cheapening the experience and make it more on par with tv show good points catwoman does act well even if she doesn represent the classic catwoman image alfred is well cast and andy serkis does quite good job it an interesting new take while respecting the character some good lighting and cinematography the dark techno in the club is cool vibe batmobile was different not necessarily good or bad1.0\tquite surprised by how well made this movie was it was gripping from start to finish it comes so close to being the next best batman movie after nolan batman robert pattinson is excellent cast for batman1.0\tbest batman movie ever notice how said batman the christopher nolan movies genuinely don feel like batman movies but this one was the first movie to feel like an actual batman movie to me from the cinematography to the acting to the story everything was top notch and it everything you expect from batman movie gotham was spot on showing all the deep corruption in the city and no backstory was told for the 10th time which didn make it seem like anything was being repeated all the side characters did amazing and planted the seeds well for the next movie1.0\tthis is what ve always been wanting to see in batman movie visually absolutely stunning with aesthetic which feels like dream this movie really captures the depth of moments and intensity of situations the actors really nailed their roles in this never doubted robert could bring the best version of this character but he was even more remarkable than expected he brought out all the aspects of batman and bruce wayne ve always wanted to see on screen really making you feel his soul every detail of this movie is phenomenal in my opinion the batmobile feeling like more than just batmans vehicle the actors fitting perfectly in their roles the city of gotham as ve always wanted it to be the aesthetic the plot of course and just about everything this movie had me with goosebumps the whole way through and will never leave my heart or mind just phenomenal cinema blessed this now exists1.0\trobert pattinson has grown up lot since twilight liked him in tenet so had high hopes for him as batman and he didn disappoint it more of detective film it like the very early stages of batman as vigilante working closely with gordon you get to meet lot of characters from the franchise it setup for 2nd so imagine it ll be new trilogy stylistically say it the best batman ever made it dark very dark soundtrack is full of darkness it shot perfectly though reminds me of hour long seven mixed with sin city vibes still got nothing on nolan trilogy but it must watch marked it down as it was tad too long and didn think much of the riddler 101.0\tve made no secret to the fact that dc films have been extremely hit and miss with me over the last decade plus 2016 batman vs superman the dawn of justice to this day remains the superhero comic book film nadir as for robert pattinson until his turns in 2020 the devil all the time and tenet ambivalence is the most accurate feeling ve had about him as an actor the mixture of these elements in my mind didn bode well for the batman yet hope springs eternal so still found myself excited enough to jump at the chance to see the movie early at fan event swag in hand properly bundled up and with solid plan for pacing my drink consumption settled in for the hour 56 minute matt reeves writer director reimagined rebooted batman saga bottom line yes the batman is far superior to the most recent batman films and does fantastic job taking the affleck stank off the character sorry ben you re awesome but your take on batman did nothing but hurt me in ways have yet to recover from pattinson however nails this version of batman wonderfully you get the dark brooding anger as well as the serious butt kicking but you also get the gullibility naivety desperation and even dare say touch of stupidity of the caped crusader mere two years into his journey this stripped down back to basics diy batman bruce wayne goes deeper brings more to the character and happily brings back the oomph missing since christian bale vacated the role batman is once again flawed tortured human being that engages entertains and even amuses instead of some chronically constipated animatronic suit thank you robert pattinson for making me give damn about batman once again not for nothing but the casting throughout the film is great zoe kravitz selina kyle is smart brash sexy and complete badass without the cheese factor that commonly attached to the character modern day cat woman please and thank you jeffrey wright bit underused perhaps makes an honorable james gordon andy serkis establishes himself as proper heir to the alfred throne colin farrell is as unrecognizable as he is delightful as oz paul dano crazy creepy excellence john turturro thank you for reminding me how much like you as an actor another relief this go around is not only not having to watch poor thomas and martha wayne bite the dust again hmmm little marvel influence perhaps but an interesting twist to their overall story serves as the catalyst for the film plot also having wayne manor actually in gotham proper adds nice touch and works well the batman score soundtrack is terrific nirvana something in the way absolute perfection every time the cinematography is stunning there are several scenes that are beyond gorgeous and not only brought smile to my face just witnessing them but tear to my eye and yes the film is dark shocking not tonally as well as literally but for once never felt was suddenly listening to radio program instead of watching movie huzzah also having some light to even amusing moments keeps the batman from being an epic depressive episode blessing for sure near three hour run time is bit too long the pacing especially the first half lags on and off as for the last half of the film there are couple of moments you think you re done but you re not fortunately neither of these are complete detriment to the film never got bored or pulled out of the film completely but felt the drags nonetheless bottom line the batman has come through and delivered widely engaging and entertaining film that has me once again excited about dc and the prospects of their upcoming films well worth the trip to your local theater and the price of admission from my standpoint glad went look forward to seeing it again and seeing where the franchise goes next also yes there one tiny little post credit scene at the very end of the film it nothing crucial and pretty predictable so stay or don the choice is really up to you and your bladder the batman1.0\twent into this movie with high expectations and was not disappointed really enjoyed the dark and gloomy theme of the movie as feel it really encapsulates batman character paul dano did great job as portraying an evil creepy and hateable villain really liked seeing detective side of batman and it works really well in this movie being that the villain is the riddler 10 10 very impressed highly recommend this movie1.0\tit was one of the most greatest superhero movie have ever seen in my life and really recommend it and hope that you enjoy it really liked how they focused on the batman more than bruce1.0\tthe movie is very nice if you know who batman is there are very accurate details this makes me pay for the movie ticket again and look into the details1.0\tthis movie is more of dark murder mystery rather then super hero movie if you can accept that then this is excellent movie you enjoy it bit slower and grittier but the story and acting is great1.0\tit no secret that batman has quite few movies under his utility belt but there one core aspect of his character that rarely been shown on the big screen his detective skills he is known as the world greatest detective after all yet in most of his films we don see him do much investigating until now more so than traditional comic book movie the batman from director producer co writer matt reeves is detective story refreshing change of pace from the character previous live action installments in the film gotham city elite and upstanding citizens become the targets of mysterious serial killer called the riddler and batman two years into his crime fighting crusade along with gcpd lieutenant jim gordon must solve his clues in order to put an end to the bloodshed all the while uncovering corruption and lies kept hidden by the city rich and powerful along the way they encounter an intriguing cast of characters including unlikely ally selina kyle crime boss carmine falcone and oswald oz cobblepot aka the penguin falcone lieutenant and proprietor of the iceberg lounge nightclub every single member of the cast is incredible with many of them becoming my personal favorite live action adaptations of their respective character such as robert pattinson titular dark knight who exudes quiet intensity and is able to convey multitude of emotions without speaking word and colin farrell penguin who is utterly unrecognizable in the role and steals every scene he in to name few the film itself is captivating and incredibly well paced despite having nearly hour runtime and my eyes were glued to the screen throughout the entirety of it one reason for this is the fact that the batman is easily the most beautifully shot comic book movie ve ever seen due to the exceptionally brilliant work of cinematographer greig fraser also have to give major praise to composer michael giacchino and production designer james chinlund whose music and sets elevated the film to whole new level and filled me with excitement suspense and many more emotions overall matt reeves and co have proven that they truly understand the characters they re working with and have crafted smart gripping masterpiece set in new bat universe which incredibly eager to revisit as soon as possible and will hopefully continue for many years to come1.0\tbelieve this movie is the best superhero movie since dark knight pattinson is surprisingly awesome despite his lack of build he great batman but an overly emo and unconvincing bruce wayne zoe kravitz is by far the least interesting and most irrelevant character in this movie she kind of just there to be there colin and paul are awesome the story is great and personally wasn bored at all despite the hour run time the bat mobile chase is epic the film is beautifully shot saw it in 4d and definitely recommend 100.0\teasily the most boring overly dark and lame batman almost fell asleep within the first 45 mins so had to leave the theatre was shocked by how bad this film was1.0\tthe batman is nothing short of phenomenal it may be long but it sure does make up for it with it thrilling goose chase it is not overloading with characters but has enough to give it atmosphere have already fallen in love with this film and recommend it to any film fan0.0\ttoo dark screen boring story non excitement sleepy weak actions and no characterization robert pattinson is like emo teenage boys and he is not good in batman the director only used the name of batman with lot of advertisement so they are making lot of money but this is not what we expect from the batman1.0\thonestly one of the greatest batman movies ever made pattinson might become my favorite batman depending how this saga continues hours were still very long for this one but can complain enjoyed every minute1.0\tloved the writing ed pattinson did good job overall however this is not an excellent movie it just good movie this one should not be rated any higher than the christopher nolan batman the cast and music from those along with the writing are above and beyond this film would still recommend to watch this one as it good film1.0\timpressed by both robert and zoi performance there not wasted minute here action scenes are done perfectly sound music fits so good amazing1.0\tthis was good movie patterson is great batman by the emo bruce isn good for me very dark penguin is very mob like character and cat women is good but not as good as hathaway riddler is out of control good acting but couldn beat the dark knight1.0\tokay robert pattinson yes have liked former versions of batman each has its pros and cons this iteration was gritty and dark taking me back to the comic books am not going to reveal any spoilers but this batman holds the best rendition of what batman stands for and against paul dano was excellent as always zoë kravitz wow that was selina kyle and the chemistry was there between batman and catwoman as well as the strong personalities of both for someone that has been batman fan for over 50 years this was the best yet1.0\tthe batman really don know how to start it gave me the comics vibes and gotham vibes more than nolan movies of course nolan movies are masterpieces but this movie gave me more gotham vibes and better cat woman and very amazing villain loved the batman gordon team and loved the city and the directing everything was perfect and riddler goal it was amazing but nolan joker is the best villain forever go watch it and enjoy it you will love it and take your friends and have good day end your day with that masterpiece now let talk about the plot the plot it was great and the writing was amazing and pattinson batman wow no dust and cat woman loved the character it better than nolan one dark knight rises in acting and writing loved the character more here and penguin it was genius idea to put him in the movie and loved how gordon and batman became close friends everything was good and loved the comics gotham vibes and the comics characters vibes that was all thank you for reading have nice day1.0\tgo watch and dive into arkham dark world every scene and background music is phenomenal totally loved it even supporting cast robert pattinson played batman dark and intense totally deserve1.0\tdrama horror this is the probably best movie in the last decade thank you matt reeves for this perfection pure art wonderfull casting amazing storytellin michael giacchino soundtrack is on another level rob and zoe nailed it hope for more to come maybe triology1.0\tthe batman finally gives us movie where batman shows he detective skill to prove one again that he is truly the world greatest detective thus does take away the action that us expected in batman movie1.0\tthe first quarters of the movie are genuinely great felt that the last quarter of the movie really fell short sets up fantastic ending that does not stick the landing as well as it could have1.0\tmystery triller drama action world greatest detective these are everything want from batman movie and to my surprised are actually in this film wow such good great movie and there some flaws here and there but it doesn bother me is this the definitive batman that we re looking for1.0\thave seen it twice and am convinced this is the best on screen batman we have seen so far had faith in robert pattinson from the beginning and he truly delivered with his performance1.0\tone word amazing loved every minute of it from start to finish thrilling fearful dark intense and stunning performances by every cast member this is everything previous batman portrayers lacked will definitely be buying this once it hits the shelves 10 10 recommend0.0\tafter all the hype really thought this film would blow me away it didn but bonus points for making america dirty little incels the villains1.0\tjust wanna say the batman 2022 just great movie bgm was epic satisfied just wanna say the batman 2022 just great movie bgm was epic satisfied just wanna say the batman 2022 just great movie bgm was epic satisfied just wanna say the batman 2022 just great movie bgm was epic satisfied1.0\tscript 10 camera 10 scenery 10 cast 10 sound 10 action 10 humor 10 length 10 the film comes off bit like sin city and john wick knock off however the violence is not as explicit and splattery which in turn gives the film certain quality pattinson is good batman but sometimes he is too much in the role of the aloof vampire who lives sexually abstinent and shows no humor because that could diminish the sexual appeal to the opposite sex in the whole film smiled twice once when batman was in catwoman apartment and the cats scrounged along his legs the other time can remember liked the fact that catwoman zoe kravitz embodied the role very well especially physically was given strong role and that some interesting ideas were taken up in the film even if it didn reach the originality of nolan batman movies and what also liked is that the sound of reeves is balanced and not so designed for bombast as in nolan films in combination with zimmer however the sound is not as variable as tarantino or ritchie in the pop cultural reference personally big fan of batman films since batman isn particularly shining hero and there lot of socio critical potential in the criticism of the hero figure nolan has already lifted lot of this potential but reeves film has also done good job it just bummer that reeve just like nolan didn put much emphasis on humor1.0\talways enjoyed batman but let down with last few so didn read or watch anything about this before hand apart from the trailer so glad did because that was really awesome surprise different and darker take on batman but very interesting idea it worked really well cast was good and it had good effects1.0\tman this movie this movie is beautifully shot and cared for every character the acting was paul dano was so good in his role as the riddler the riddler was so menacing and creepy loved the bat and the cat dynamic this film has everything from the action to the detective true crime stuff to the romance to the mobster stuff my only gripe is don know if robert pattinson is believable bruce wayne but know he will grow on me in time so go see this beautiful movie and support the entire crew who made this dc masterpiece so enjoy batman for hours1.0\tthis film was impressive the dark thematic direction was bold and visceral the gothic makeup of patterson the retro raw tech of batman and the impressive fight scenes are brilliant however the film did suffer in few spots as well it tries to do so much too much and that shame because if it practiced tighter border in terms of creativity it could have been an incredible film not just an incredible batman film the weird cgi fight scenes are jarring the repetitive music theme is grinding the acting isn great in places and the plot is bit messy sometimes there was also some typical hollywood pc crap luckily not that much but that woke hollywood unfortunately reared it ugly head across the screen from time to time in conclusion this film is great watch however it too long and suffers from some of the above enjoy1.0\tamazing screenplay the dark theme the bgm and the scenes just made the movie more interesting and the best among batman series after the dark knight this is the best one guess we shouldn even compare this to any one like joker 2019 robert pattinson looked like batman watch it in theater to witness the gotham at its best dark mood1.0\twow just wow wasn really expecting it to be that good but it was masterpiece loved it the action and the plot were both amazing the acting was also great loved how aggressive batman was and the soundtrack just made it better one of the best batman movie ever if not the best1.0\tthe bat mobile is the best live action adaptation of the bat mobile from the original comics the attention to detail especially sounds were great the movie took dark turn as it should be as batman movie this was not an animated kids show but great adaptation of vigilante in corrupt city the antagonist was great as well as the characters being able to show areas of extreme character development within single movie the action scenes had some of the greatest cinematography had ever seen and great and unique ideas overall great experience and the best live action version of the batman1.0\tafter the dark knight trilogy finally another batman movie loved from the trailers casting the new batsuit didn think it would be that good still went to see it as batman fan was stunned the actors their acting story background music action scenes everything was fantastic ben affleck sure looked great as batman but didn like anything else of his portrayal after christian bale robert pattinson is my favorite now1.0\twas lucky enough to go to the fan first early screening of the batman and can believe ve finally seen it loved it it dark and definitely gets the detective side of batman down this is 100 detective film it more comic booky than nolan films but still doesn lean all the way into it which isn necessarily an issue but hoping it gets more fantastical as we go this is still early batman and it shows he only two years into being the caped crusader he going to make mistakes he not the always prepared batman but sure he going to get there through future films the action is brutal the cinematography is beautiful and the performances are raw jeffrey wright might just be the best gordon we ve ever gotten zoë kravitz nails the duality of catwoman colin farrell is unrecognizable as the penguin john turturro is great as falcone and paul dano is creepy and yet very campy as the riddler above all though robert pattinson is an amazing batman you can tell he truly understands the character not 100 sure if he my favorite live action portrayal behind the character but he just might be ll need some time to think on it you feel the three hour runtime but not because it exhausting but just because it really feels longer than an average film it also just gives us more things to think about not one minute of it was bored or not entertained the plot and script are so good it murder mystery but you re not trying to figure out who the murderer is you re trying to figure out who next and why it honestly made me feel like was part of the mystery at some points it doesn hurt that the film takes heavy influence from my favorite batman comic the long halloween there are few things change here and there but those are really just nitpicky can say enough good things about it and can wait to see what next batman has made an impact on me through my whole life truthfully being someone look up to despite obviously being fictional and know he in good hands with director matt reeves definitely going to see it again as feel can think about it more as was just taking it all in this time it fantastic film and my favorite live action batman film to date absolutely loved it can wait to visit gotham again1.0\tby far the best batman film made not only was it detective themed story but dark noir depicted masterpiece matt reeves has done an amazing job and has crafted this film so beautifully and it as if we are seeing everything from the batman perspective at times it felt like horror movie which loved the score was elegant and the bat and the cat chemistry was electrifying must watch and worthy trip to the cinema 10 101.0\tfinally dc has another movie can call great what can say without doubt is this is the most badass and realistic version of batman yet he is ruthless domaining his enemies and beating them till there is nothing but fear left the way these scenes are choreographed leaves nothing to be interpreted and shows the full strength and force of each blow also feel this version of batman is what child who went through trauma in his early life would be he is awkward weird and strange but represents someone who lives the life he does comparing this to the christopher nolan batman am not sure if this one is better but think one could argue these villain felt more grounded and that batman like this could exist in our world yes it is still superhero movie and is going to be unrealistic but its still more grounded than other batman think this fact helped sell his character into something the audience could believe was real and made this story more immersive in conclusion think this batman is the most interesting realistic and badass one yet think this is movie that catch myself watching more than once as there is just so much to unpack there is so many motifs and themes that you can take in through one watch don even get me started on the cinematography some of the best in while who would have known the actor from twilight made the best batman yet1.0\tve been waiting year for this one being hardcore batman fan and looked forward all day going to the cinema when batman enters the first scene my first impression was robocop slow heavy and silent it dark it rains lot and batman is now very emo and in some kind of emotional state we are supposed to meet his human side presume the cast is good penguins actor suite is amazing and the riddler is quite the character in short was pretty disappointing pattinson has the facial figures for the mask and cat lady is sexy the story well quite confusing the last 30 minutes was looking at the clock pretty regularly so hope batman will get his counseling and take his happy pills in the future1.0\tjust like the title says it was good batman movie and enjoyed watching it for the entire run time there is almost never scene without batman he is in every square inch of this movie so if you like batman recommend you watch it1.0\ttldr writing acting fight scenes cinematography score review pattinson absolutely dove headfirst into the dark brooding nature young batman should have given everything he been through he was terrific cast this movie is basically the arkham games turned into movie not saying it was as good as those games but if you like those games then you ll more than like this movie there were two dumb lines by catwoman but they fit her character well so it cancels out other than that the movie is awesome in both entertainment and technical value highly recommend1.0\tafter hearing mixed reviews went to see the batman with little expectation what can say is thoroughly enjoyed it true detective story with really good characters rob pattinson absolutely nailed it as both bruce wayne and batman was bit worried about the black emo make up but it okay was too engrossed in the story to notice the nearly three hours flew by and would highly recommend seeing it on the big screen can wait for the sequel1.0\tfrom the trailers already had high expectations and can say with smile on my face that this movie lived up to them robert pattinson did raise few concerns in me but thankfully unnecessarily the first two acts are masterpiece the acting from everyone is top notch robert pattinson maybe my favorite batman zoë kravitz paul dano and colin farrell are all excellent the cinematography is next level have never seen more lived in gotham city the ambiance of it always being gritty dirty and corrupt my only gripes with the movie are its length and its somewhat lackluster 3rd act this is the batman movie many comic book fans have wanted for long time1.0\tthis movie has exceeded my expectations highly recommend this to batman fans this movie is bit violent but it is very good have underestimated robert pattinson acting my favourite batman movie and my favorite movie1.0\tve been fangirl since saw batman mask of the phantasm as little girl and it just kept going with tim burton batman and onto nolan trilogy when first heard of the new batman and that rob pattinson was set to do the role my first reaction was nooooo my expectation was low and just tagged along my bestie who is fan of rob for it cuz love her well could not have been more wrong the batman is perfection from start to end it so delicate and made with such care what not to like about it matt reeves has laid all his passion into this movie and brought along cast that fits so well like there is absolutely nothing wrong with it what so ever and when it comes to rob pattinson like what the hell was thinking have always known he could play but was not sure about bruce wayne batman but oh how was fooling myself he has nailed it all of the emotions he puts into it the exploring and progression the symbol of hope he does realistic bruce wayne batman the haunting of his parents deaths who he is at the moment who he is to become how he fails falls struggle and gets hurt for once there is batman that doesn jump up like nothing has happened after getting bullet to the chest he human can wait to see how rob take on bruce batman will go from here but overly excited big shout out to zoë kravitz jeffrey wright andy zerkis paul dano colin farell and john turturro for their achievement wow understand this is movie you either love or hate and respect that but from comic book and mask of the phantasm view this is as good as it gets which makes my fangirl heart even warmer is that rob pattinson has said that the batman is influenced by mask of the phantasm no wonder it blew me away ve seen it three times already going in for fourth and fifth and this is easily movie can watch every single day for the rest of my life when it comes into my home my new favorite movie for sure1.0\tthis is the second best movie of batman after the dark knight must say robert pattinson is second best batman cast after christian bale he played the batman role very amazingly and the riddler also became my second favourite villian after joker health ledger must watch in theatre for every batman fan1.0\twow what can say about this movie other than totally blown away all the perfect elements went into this film and were pulled off perfectly ve been humongous batman fan all my life having seen all the films my favorite in particular being the nolan trilogy matt reeves accomplished what has desperately been needed for this character fresh new take that gives us young bruce wayne still finding his path as the batman and struggling to feel he is making an impact on gotham every actor pulled off their character perfectly especially pattinson giving us dark brooding and intimidating batman the action was on point and engaging and the soundtrack fit this film wonderfully on top of all that this was suspenseful and well put together detective story every aspect of this film hit the mark eager to see what comes next for this batman and his rogues gallery do yourself favor and watch this movie you won regret it1.0\tthis movie does many things well stylistically this is what and many always imagined live action batman to look like the batman himself is great and catwoman too others are good but not memorable this movie gives enough for background and emotion then the mediocre and good stuff pacing is good for hour movie few hiccups and completely pointless slow motion porn one or two completely useless scenes story is mediocre and boring somewhat villain motivations sort of boring or overused villain is not that interesting and whole riddle stuff doesn seem hard at all to solve action is the worst part of this movie it is stylistically nice and great at times but all the literal plot armor on batman just takes all the edge off few fist fights were very good but only because you know there wasn any stakes whenever there was stakes the action either didn have any edge or they stripped it off way too soon especially the ending real change part even though the story wasn good or exciting the writing was still rather good dialogue was overall good characters had something going for them but not much apart from batman himself and catwoman politics below here matters to some lot in this day and age considering wokeness and few elements people were afraid of like batman being soy and written of from his own story this wasn the case catwoman wasn more powerful than trained white man there were few lines about the rich priviledged whites and so on but mostly in contex in made sense considering about waynes and the rich corrupt elite in gotham overall say it is very mildy woke movie1.0\tthere have been many on screen adaptations of the batman character over the last century and it seems as though the skepticism increases every time another adaptation is announced writer and director matt reeves war for the planet of the apes cloverfield let me in provides an origin story for the caped crusader unlike anything we ve ever seen before synopsis batman ventures into gotham city underworld when sadistic killer leaves behind trail of cryptic clues as the evidence begins to lead closer to home and the scale of the perpetrator plans become clear he must forge new relationships unmask the culprit and bring justice to the abuse of power and corruption that has long plagued the metropolis what you see feel and hear instead of traditional studio set with green screens covered in the background the production team took the same approach from the mandalorian and shot in fully wrapped led studio so that the backdrops and background could better represent the environment of the film and reflect more accurate lighting why do mention this because this was the most visually appealing gotham city that ve seen on screen up to date with hazy black orange and of course red color scheme the visuals alone create the atmosphere that reeves wants you to feel from his portrayal of gotham this film is incredibly practical every detail from what batman does wears and says is completely realistic and this was major focal point for reeves when he wrote the script there are details that are explained in this film that you see in every other batman that are never explained and as viewer you experience these ah hah moments as the story progresses the film is gritty it dark it relatable and the characters are well represented there were many hesitations when the cast was announced not only for batman but for characters such as commissioner gordon alfred and the penguin the casting was brilliant and there wasn piece out of place besides referencing the comics this film doesn take any direction from previous adaptations so this 2h 56m story feels completely original and menacing you can clearly see certain films and characters that inspired this script the story is parallel to seven with deeper dive on murder mystery and the detective side of batman rather than pure origin story of bruce wayne also the riddler seems identical to the zodiac killer and paul dano was flawless in his performance and the standout character from the entire film though consider this to be the darkest version of batman yet reeves didn hesitate to sprinkle in some necessary humor to keep the film moving in relatable direction my take wow this film was well put together from the script to the characters to the acting to the visuals and to the score all around an incredible film one thing genuinely appreciated was the fact that you focus heavily on the story rather than the characters alone which has always been tough barrier to overcome with previous adaptations and for superhero films all around this is the first time that saw batman and had to ease into the character but once did really enjoyed what robert pattinson provided he expresses his dark emotions in way that we ve never seen from bruce wayne portrayal however pattinson seemed bit reserved and stiff with his expressions throughout the film but that very well could have been the way that his character was scripted though consider this the most practical batman film was bit disappointed from time to time with noticeable special effect sequences also pattinson was noticeably uncomfortable in his bat suit which is an issue that has been around since the creation of the character the noir energy from the story as well as from bruce wayne was oddly refreshing and enjoyable overall this film lived up to the expectations that personally had and excited to see what direction matt reeves goes from here grade 101.0\tthis movie is grim and dark and full of suspense with the mysteries being solved by the world greatest detective batman and done exactly how batman movie should be robert pattinson portrayed the best batman till now every other main characters were superb in their role the cinematography and the background score were top notch it going to be cult classic soon if it not the best batman movie made till now it one of the top obviously enjoy this masterpiece1.0\tjust the performance from the riddler alone is amazing watching him act and talk sends chills down my spine and makes me feel like watching true crime documentary1.0\tperfect nthng else to say honestly matt had really outdone the movie was at the grasp of my seat each and every second just wish could watch it again if my parents leave me again0.0\tthat really all you need to know the cinematography is gorgeous but it twilight all over again it not the actors fault though the entire cast seems to be going through cringe emo phase where the only emotions seem to be dark and broody or angsty based on how the film was directed and then cut the batman did not need to be hours long would have rather stayed home knitting than watch this and can knit to save my life1.0\tfirstly this version of batman should not be compared to the dark knight trilogy this version standouts on its own merits and is simply darker and grittier pattinson is outstanding and brings the moody darker side or bruce wayne we all wanted the cast for this film is amazing and cannot wait for the next film1.0\tim still in shock never though for sec dc will make movie as good as dark knight this movie is something else like who did he make the hours so enjoyable and so perfect and cinematography is crazyyyy the suit is great and riddler is mindblown he was the best riddler dc ever made the whole movie was in dark gotham was the best choice this is matt reeves art1.0\tthe movie is incredibly ambitious to write so many characters and such complex plot with such new universe 10 we don need the origin story that has been done so many times so am greatful they didnt do that but to go with the riddler who connects the dots of corruption to bring down the entire city was incredibly ambitious for an opening act paul dano was by far the best thing in this movie 10 he did stunning job playing the riddler was so impressed with him robert pattionson on the other hand am sorry but still get glimpses of the socially awkward emo vampire in this movie 10 it reminds me of johnny depp who dont think has much range as an actor either depp plays the same creepy character which just happens to be who he is robert pattinson is just socially awkward actor am happy pattinson did different take on batman than trying to be just like christian bale batman but he just wasn who batman is he did decent job at being the worlds greatest detective but the writers kind of screwed him over when heard him say the line alfred stop you re not my father mean come on it doesnt get more cliche than that and batman would never say that batman also isn controlled by his emotions and irrational like pattinson portrayal is how can pattinson improve if they get second movie or third and think they will would love to see his character grow think he can become the classic batman role emotionless blunt controlled smart and that would show me that pattinson is great actor if this does happen then this movie would be elevated to an 10 for sure because it would show that batman is just young which he is in this movie and that they planned for him to grow as character all along cinematography is great 10 it not beautiful like snyders dcu but don care for that look anyway it gritty it dirty composed and real great job in the end think it good movie is it the best batman movie no not even close which is why am only rating it 101.0\tif you keep the movies completely separate and don compare them it is actually pretty good pretty much only watched it because robert is in it love him but he seemed more like an emo kid than vigilanty the storyline is great loved that they didn make cat woman super sexy zoey naturally is and they played on that her costumes were mainly kid friendly1.0\tstart by saying that the batman basically is cinecomic that is aimed at the general public which however differs from the marvel films or the dc cinematic universe in fact reeves tries to bring to the big screen not the usual film full of action scenes and with large amount of special effects but film noir investigative in which the real protagonist is not the characters but the interweaving of the plot the batman played by pattison is very dark and realistic but at the same time it is very much reflected in the pages of the comic this film unlike begins focuses on the figure of batman the figure of bruce wayne appears for few minutes during the film in fact reeves makes us understand that bruce is the real mask of batman who tries to have purpose in life after the murder of his parents the villain is very scary figure who makes the plot mystery the riddler goes to carry out his crimes during scenes full of tension and violent connect to this point to say that this batman is very violent you hardly ever see the blood but we know that to make violent scene you don just need the splatter reeves manages to show all the violence and darkness of gotham without showing you anything so explicit one of the elements that appreciated the most is the relationship between sergeant gordon and batman they investigate for the duration of the film and you can feel the trust that each feels in the other in one scene batman is seen in the midst of numerous policemen the batman seems to be the alien element but when he starts talking you understand the potential of this character another relationship that really enjoyed is the one batman has with selina catwoman zoe kravits manages to make this relationship mysterious which oscillates between being in love or relationship of mutual esteem if you look at the technical aspect believe that few cinecomics are able to reach this level reeves plays with colors red yellow and blue uses many very close ups that show the raw truth of the characters the few action scenes are almost all shot perfectly but the element that appreciated most of the direction of the batman is the scary figure of the bat lived in the streets of gotham reeves in one scene shows you the entire fear of the criminal as soon as he sees the signal in the sky can say that from directorial point of view reeves managed to bring to light better direction than nolan in batman begins christopher is very good at character management but he lacks in some action scenes that are bit cumbersome and complicated to follow it will improve lot in the dark knight the photography that is at high level and the soundtrack is majestic michael giacchino composes memorable themes that can be compared to hans zimmer soundtrack in begins finally can say that the film is not perfect some plot passages are bit cumbersome and an action scene is perhaps slightly confusing but can say that promote the batman and hope that it will be the first chapter of trilogy worthy of this character1.0\tfinally batman movie worthy of the name batman totally the comic feel to it and patttinson was the right call to play batman and the hours was time well spent predict it will do good at the oscars this year1.0\tdon understand the some of the negative reviews on here as the batman is an instant classic it may be hours long but it drags you along for the ride and for me the best version of batman to date it everything you want in batman film and the soundtrack and the buildup of batman coming in to shot is film masterpiece ignore any negative review and go and see it with your own eyes and opinion truly modern day classic1.0\tthis movie was way too long the story could have been much more concise there were lots of periods of lagging intensity know action movies can be all action but this one was so boring add pattinson acting and will not pay to see when it becomes available on streaming services1.0\tas fellow actor can only say bravo bravo robert and also have to apologize for doubting you never again hope you can accept my apology thank you for great performance bravo robert bravo1.0\tthe batman was pretty amazing didn expect robert pattison to play the role in such an amazing way the movie felt way darker then the nolan movies overall loved the movie and it gave alot of action as well way better then nolan first0.0\tsince the first trailer dropped at dc fandome was highly anticipating this movie the concept of neo noir brooding detective procedural style interpretation of batman is fresh approach for the character one practically begging to be explored and matt reeves track record thus far planet of the apes films cloverfield demonstrates him as competent director from the trailers the potential of the tone performances and narrative was the most exciting thing to me first the good the cinematography for this film was top notch there were shots and sequences that were extremely well staged the movie was very well concepted possibly at the expense of the writing and the narrative see below michael giacchino soundtrack is simultaneously pulse pounding and brooding absolutely thought the music was fantastic well orchestrated batman theme while tad repetitive in giacchino fashion star trek dr strange etc has rousing component that complements the dark psychosis of the main chorus with hope and resolve all the character themes were among my favorite tracks as well as highway to the anger zone and get fight city halloween character designs and performances pattinson plays great batman paul dano performance as the riddler and the visual interpretation and concept for this character is so so so excellent colin farell oz is executed so well can say enough good about the acting and performances in this movie the not so good this film felt like universe building attempt it felt like an effort to cram one season of tv series into three hours all of the potential for these characters was squandered here everything from the core of the movie that was supposed to be the web of lies in gotham threaded through every character subplot glossed over described in expositional plot dialogue on to the next set piece in the procedural repeat the batman motivation and background is laid out almost entirely in plot sure this doesn need to be another origin story for him but the emotional anchor for his mission in gotham is almost entirely skimmed over without it robert pattinson excellent visceral performance for the character feels frustratingly like the tip of very promising iceberg of an analysis on the character psychosis and evolution as vengeful angry very flawed night human wearing hockey pads his connection to his parents and the story behind their lives and the whole subplot therein is all laid out through expositional dialogue and plot thin boring and that essence needs to be the anchor the foundation of his mission is his vengeance for the death of his parents his relationship with them his relationship with alfred it needed more show and less tell having this more fleshed out would have made his arc in this film way more satisfying would have made the second act turn way more gut wrenching as his world is turned upside down and his ultimate arc as he comes to terms with the connotations of being hero this movie works on lot of assumptions about the amount of prior knowledge you have of the character and his relationships with other characters as batman while trying to build new universe and turning lot of those dynamics upside down but there is no world to turn upside down we just now are entering it being introduced to it the approach for this movie storytelling is disappointing portions of the character development were executed horribly and frustratingly lacking to say the least the same goes for the riddler wanted to see more of focused well executed spotlight of his essence his background just one movie with batman and riddler to give that dynamic the attention it deserves same for catwoman whole subplot same for gordon this is amazing spider man snyder justice league modern hollywood universe building syndrome in exhibition here skim the universe promise two spin off shows promise two sequels and even with those somehow doubt we ll see the character depth these interpretations deserve by the time we were in the middle of the second hour was disappointed in how little cared about what happened to batman or falcone or catwoman there was so much potential here to have something original and thoroughly good well written and well executed maybe it deserves rewatch re evaluation at some point don know but man there was lot of potential here and that the most frustrating part1.0\twithout doubt the greatest representation of batman have ever seen on screen with inspiration from the emotional depth of batman mask of the phantasm as well as storylines from the long halloween this movie really explores aspects of batman character many have not seen yet and universe excited to see expanded glad robert proved me wrong and is indeed the best batman have ever seen0.0\tthree good stories from the comics to cinema being torned and mangled rip off from the dark knight with lesser batman and lesser villain for me the worst batman as character with ben affleck could be better movie with other approaches then grimm and angsty but you re not ready for that conversation zack snyder please comeback to the dceu restorethesnyderverse0.0\timagine going and watching movie made by someone who has never seen batman movie rather they ve only heard someone talk about batman then imagine going and seeing batman movie only to sit there and watch hours of story with maybe 30 minutes of action scenes mixed in throughout then imagine watching those 30 minutes of actions scenes made by someone who has only heard about fighting they ve never actually seen fight that is what the batman is boring story that could have been cut in half with horrible action scenes where you can clearly tell robert pattinson doesn know how to actually fight the car scene was decent but again lacked any real depth or suspense it just kind of there if you are die hard batman fan maybe you ll like this for the storyline aspect of it but even then it is just long drawn out dribble that could have been done in hours too many of the scenes were completely unnecessary and in those scenes they extended the dialog way too much even my 13 and 11 year old kids were bored and were just waiting for the torture to end this movie will be on the dvd sale rack at your local truck stop sooner than you think0.0\tno drama not any good acting just try to make good pictures its better to use each squences for wallpaper on your device it is not the meaning of camera0.0\tcouldn wait to watch this but what complete let down from the way it was filmed the acting the stunts the cast robert himself to thin scuffy to pull batman off so disappointed1.0\tthe movie is about 40 mins too long at times was getting bored by the dialogue if your expecting comic book villains then you ll be disappointed the movie is cross between seven and gothika action scenes were okay but few and far between as for the anguished robert patinson with dark eye make up the vampire becomes bat0.0\tdid the world need another reboot why have batman be emo why the corny music why romantic subplot and how is it unbelievable since she has short manly hair why does he barely speak and when he does it is barely audible why does it say batman but it is agatha christie instead0.0\tthis re imagined batman is mixed bag on the one had it really has detective feel to it reminiscent of the old detective comics it has dark atmosphere and the riddler presents some interesting puzzles to solve but that was about it the director decided to muddle the legacy of the wayne family insisting that his family was corrupt and bruce was the product of white privilege it was cringe worthy moment for many in the theater the entire movie batman seems so offended by his own existence at some point thought he might put on dark eye shadow punch holes in drywall batman has always been hero he shown confidence and strength through his weakness for child he was someone to look up to now he just miserable like the generation he now represents1.0\tthis movie absolutely nails batman reeves take on the cape crusader really nails elements of batman we haven seen on screen from really highlighting the fear and brutality to nailing the detective side of batman we ve seldom seen reeves does phenomenal job showcasing some of the best batman moments ve seen live action the good the first of this movie was absolutely amazing this movie does great job of pulling you right into the world of gotham right from the opening scene it was interesting to see the world that these characters existed in and how in way gotham itself was another antagonist that the batman had to overcome the story although predictable in spots was really solid it was fun to trying to solve the mystery alongside batman also was surprised at how much the filmmakers got away with under the pg 13 rating this film is dark both literally and figuratively but loved it as far as characters go pattinson is batman kravitz and farrell killed it in their roles as catwoman and the penguin dano take on the riddler was creepy as it was cerebral and jeffrey wright is now my favorite jim gordon the bad like mentioned earlier the first of this movie was amazing the third act is when the movie comes to screeching halt in terms of pacing really felt the nearly three hour run time when the film makes the weird decision to tell you about things that happened instead of showing them this lead to dialogue that felt more like exposition dumps which drained some of the energy for me beyond that loved the partnership between catwoman and batman but the love connection seemed forced also did not care for the riddler about face in the third act it seemed as if he was trying to embody elements of the joker which kind of made certain scenes come off more goofy than intended verdict all in all really did enjoy this film and am glad that made the decision to see this in theaters versus waiting for it to come to hbo max this movie is an experience that you must witness in its full spectacle to really appreciate this refreshing rendition of batman needless to say beyond excited to see more movies and tv shows set in this batman universe you will not be disappointed1.0\tthe batman 2022 is the revitalization this iconic comic book hero desperately needed after the failings of batman vs superman fans were eagerly awaiting challenger that could rival nolan dark knight trilogy it safe to say that the batman is that challenger it is gripping film from start to finish and it hour runtime flies by the soundtrack is fantastic the cinematography is beautiful and the story is fresh and interesting looking forward to hearing about what reeves is planning next1.0\tthe batman what liked loved that they tried to do something different with the movie loved the pacing and mood of the film alfred excellent bruce pattinson decent penguin great catwoman kravitz awesome gordon great chase scene phenomenal fight scenes good not great or spectacular but some cool stuff in the movie batman selina kyle scenes evolved and were great zoey was awesome as cat woman maybe the best yet the mask had some cool skull like contours like how the story tied into the wayne family batman vehicle think the movie can fit on shelf beside the others batman year ii what didn like riddler but not great started out ok but didn get better and expected more the cyphers fell short in the plot to me it didn seem sophisticated enough or make sense to the batman messages story was little weak imo the riddler tale unraveling wasn what it could have been seemed bit homogenized story tropes fathers mothers failed little to me seemed unnecessary riddler story had so much potential so much but it fell short liked the overall direction of the film the story fell short and lacked that hook characters carried the movie the story didn wasn fan of the mask nose on batman mask but the costume overall was cool0.0\twe miss nolan batman the film has the ambition to make us live an investigation over hours but except for some action scenes we fall asleep in front of what is only caricature of the superhero movie and which gives reason to martin scorsese comments about them1.0\tdon often give 10 10 for film but after taking this in at my local theater yesterday could give it no less it checked absolutely every box for me and met every expectation clocking in at nearly hours not single detail was missed it gave me clear view of the ultimate reluctant hero who is still learning who he is as the batman the visibly dark imagery paired with the grit and filth of life in gotham city gripped me from start to finish many people would probably disagree with me but feel that robert turned in performance that rivals even christian bale paul dano was perfection as the riddler the entire cast truly was most excellent will be making this film part of my permanent collection to be enjoyed for years to come1.0\tfrom the atmosphere to the performances the cinematography the score everything about this movie is perfect to me for slow burn gritty detective story running at almost hours long it never felt like it dragged perfect pacing can wait to watch again1.0\tmy only problem is that was way too long and became little boring 30 minutes less and my score would be higher zoe was perfection as cat woman robert was good solid cast do not know the actor that played the riddler he was insanely good1.0\tbased on the reviews the batman is very polarizing movie where some love it and some hate it yes it moody and yes its dark but that the whole point ve grown very tired of the current structure of marvel movies with the quipy humor and predictable time traveling and how the other dc movies just fall flat the batman is an actual film that firstly crime horror thriller and secondly of the super hero genre pattinson was great batman and bruce wayne not all billionaires are eccentric some sure don give damn about the general public and keep to themselves because they can do whatever they want this is also year batman where he still learning and figuring out how to balance his life he states in the movie how he doesn want to be bruce wayne because his primary focus is being the batman the action was brutal and we see less of the boyscout batman of the past too which was appreciated looking forward to what comes next for sure1.0\tthis movie was incredible loved emo batman so much the only thing that didn like was that the relationship was only tease know that catwoman has alway been like this im just not fan of the trope robert pattinson was amazing bjust as good as christian bale1.0\tone of the best batman origin based movie every time we saw little bruce or year but for the first time we saw batman year where he is just man in mask seeking revenge the story of becoming vengeance to batman1.0\talways knew robert pattinson would make great batman and after seeing the batman inclined to say that he easily better than ben affleck and in my books even better than christian bale the movie heralds the beginning of new batman franchise and can already predict that matt reeves batman universe will be better one than even nolan nolan universe has so far been seen as the best ever primarily due to the dark knight and that was mostly due to health ledger mind blowing performance but simply love the look of the new universe that is being created the gotham city is straight outta the comics the batman is only in his second year and yes his character arc will definitely keep evolving in the next sequels to come the ending already gives away most of what will follow and it gonna be fricckin amazing frankly in my opinion this was movie with very few flaws and if any the strengths easily outweigh the flaws absolutely masterpiece which deserves second watch1.0\tthe batman is great movie and definitely the best batman yet but in the uk it rated 15 which simply don get there bit of violence but not too much and there absolutely no profanity so as much as recommend the batman also recommend it not 151.0\trobert pattinson played the role of the batman very well love how we got to see the detective side of batman everything about the movie was fantastic and would highly recommend that you watch it film and storytelling at its best is vehicle for us to vent the anger rage frustration and horror we feel right now we re exhausted by the pandemic we re afraid of war we re all having hard time but we can in good conscience go out and lose our minds punching people in the street when emotions are large and unwieldy and they seem out of proportion we turn to fiction to see fictional character do what we wish we could1.0\tit was so realistic interesting it has too many darkness like it but still cannot judge about the old batman in 2005 till 2012 christian bale but think we can judges tell the batman completing the trilogy0.0\tfirst of all robert patinson to play dark role did not have to be so ugly still haven understood the point of catwoman and what about penguin relayed to supporting role finally we feel that the film wants to arrive at moral that even the director did not understand in his guts but psychologically it was an interesting proposition the process to arrive at this discovery not being the best while that moral was great and since the process of incarnation was wrong batman route in this movie to get there led him to get lost in history to disincarnate him to become only good fighter batman this hero who embodies our dark side and who seeks to transcend it who sees in his enemies kind of mirror of himself and therefore offers mirror of part of us could have found in the scenario subtle game with his adversary much finer than what was proposed to us the director remaining on the surface not having the means to give himself the realization of his ambition and getting out of it by rewriting yet another gangster story but in gotham city0.0\tdid not like this movie it was long and boring it not the cast fault they did an fair job they have changed too much christopher nolan thrioligy are much better did not buy this story the backstory of bruce waine and batman is not wissible in the movie as much0.0\tbots must be rating this movie people booed at the end during the show people left got restless and took several bathroom breaks were on their phone or legit fell asleep lol this movie was bad to me and apparently to majority of the others who shared that theater with me ve seen amazing moody films but this was not one of them it was long dragged out soo many slow parts inaudible at times lots of focus on bruce batman just staring at things and random stuff happened for long periods of time that made no sense would never watch this again not even if given to me for free it felt like torture sitting through the entire film awake good luck and to those who did like it to each their own definitely not my cup of tea those1.0\tloved it superb gritty dark thriller with great blend of suspense action and character development all the relationships batman catwoman bruce alfred batman gordon work and evolve so well robert pattinson is brilliant1.0\tunlike most people do believe something are perfect but not everything is perfect for everyone it subjective like taste but for me this movie was perfect granted as batman fan could like this even if this movie was average but it knocked it out of the park when near what seemed like the end and everything was wrapping up wanted to watch even more and then the film delivered it climax with amazing ending all up it spectacular watch that has to be must watch for any batman fan1.0\tif you thought the dark knight was great movie wait for this one epic movie great acting this new batman is more drak in good way cant wait to see the next movie1.0\toh my gosh matt reeves is such brilliant director the work he did on the batman is so fabulous after so long this is the batman movie wanted to see this was the batman movie needed pattinson is so amazing he just shut up those who didn believe him round of applause for the casting director as they made the best choice possible in short the batman is work of art its references to david fincher thrillers are intent and genius yet they manage to follow something totally authorial as for the shooting time this movie showed me only have one thing to say if reeves has hour cut of this movie need it1.0\tit is hard to review the batman 2022 without addressing mcu two decade long dominance over the superhero genre where the formulaic mcu succeeds the batman soares in defying it no origin story no grand supervillain introduction actually no supervillain at all no smart ass quips no main fight sequence no archetypal overcoming insurmountable odds victory storyline etc one could ask what kind of superhero movie are we left with well perhaps we have forgotten what motion pictures are about sincere story telling the batman starts out as minor detective story growing into major crime saga we are unceremoniously but organically introduced to multiple characters of many motives and tragedies but also hopes and ambitions all of them breathes life into the depths of what gotham city is and can be before mcu however we had multiple stand alone batman movies the director matt reeves captures the essence of batman in ways past silver screen iterations never could what all his predecessors did burton schumacher nolan snyder were adapting the source material for the big screen in the blockbuster tradition typically with spectacles fanfares catchphrases pg13 etc reeves however adapted the source material in favor of sincere batman story don get me wrong love nolan and consider tdk one of my all time favorites but it is essential to the batman lore as it is to the blockbuster pantheon in which find contradictory let me explain myself batman is not the typical superhero or blockbuster material he is in essence lone vigilante and is not flashy he operates behind the scenes solving cases out of plain sight and in the dark infiltrating every layer of the city not excluding legislation politics poverty inequality depression this do not spell money making for the hollywood execs but by taking the risk on telling sincere story of smaller scope in terms of action and spectacle we gain bigger ambition in terms of characterisation and drama never have we come as close to batman as we have now1.0\tobviously this is batman movie matt did it and all cast in 100 cinemaphotography wonderful music is insane sometimes rythm went slow but overall got 10 if see it more time maybe change my opinion about rating1.0\toh boy have we waited for something like this this is the only movie ve watched where ve been up on my toes waiting for what would happen next have not been up on my toes for long time this is the movie of the year the whole cast did such good job on thia movie the story line was amazing the soundtrack was incredible the length of this movie was perfect and respected every minute of it this movie is up there with the dark knight you wont be disappointed will definitely be going to watch it again loved it great film 10 101.0\tthis is great movie and in my opinion the best batman movie there has been made it is very dark movie and that is just right for the batman the story and the acting is also really good it is long movie but was not bored time it is not like all the other superhero movies and that is what like about it 10 10 would watch again0.0\tthis movie was honestly one of the worst and most boring movies have ever watched in my life and as dc fan was majorly disappointed with this movie would not recommend anyone watch this ever1.0\tthis movie does everything one may want from batman movie it leans heavily on the comics and has lot of respect for the source material pattinson kills it so does zoë as catwoman farrel as penguin and dano as riddler jeffrey wright also silences the haters that doubted if he was right for the role tho to be honest we don get too much on his character but what is have seen is brilliant the movie is nearly hours long but it never feels like it drags at it remains very focused on the main plot so it feels like no time was wasted visually this movie is brilliant every other shot has tremendous amounts of production value in it and it thanks to grieg fraser behind the camera the movie blends practical effects with grounded cgi perfectly to create the great action set pieces talking about action it is choreographed so well this is the most brutal batman except for probably affleck but he killed so it doesn really count the score by michael giacchino is insanely good and fits the overall tone perfectly this is dark and grim noir film that isn suited for kids despite it pg 13 rating but it definitely worth seeing no matter what you know or don know about batman definite reccomend 10 101.0\tit almost hours and did never get bored good chose of music actors the villain was really good the directing is 10 10 there lot of frames just can find the word to describe it iam gonna rewatch it of course1.0\tfrom the color grading cinematography music score stunt setup chemistry between actors and direction of the movie they all complement one another which in turn produces this beaut didn have the luxury to watch the dark knight in theatre format so from movie watching experience the batman takes the crown for the best batman movie can wait to watch it again and again until bored 10 100.0\tdefinitely didn live up to the hype once you realize it is trash after the 1st 45mins of giving it chance it makes decent background noise while you scroll on your phone the dark knight rises series was the best in my opinion would rather watch the dated adam west tv series than watch this movie 2nd time1.0\tthe cgi was top notch it has great music amazing performances by pattinson kravitz dano and the others great writing lot of heartwarming wow and wtf moments also the plot is just amazing many plot twists kept it interesting and just loved the ending matt reeves did spectacular job on this1.0\tthis has to be the best batman since burtons flims robert did amazing job as bruce wayne and batman the movie didn waste any time with lot of boring scenes with just bruce and the cinematography was stunning and very dark and moody looking forward to the sequels this is must watch1.0\tthis film was everything wanted it to be and more the riddler was super scary and robert pattinsons batman was really dark and he was vengance in every possible way the detective aspect of this film was really great and refreshing this isn very normal in most superhero movies think this is must watch even if you have never seen batman movie this movie is solid1.0\teverything could have wanted in an introduction batman movie gives you great sense of where the characters are and where they are going fantastic acting all around and felt like was watching comic book reeves did an amazing job1.0\tesses idiotas que estão dando nota menos que oito não estão avaliando filme como deveria pois não gostam da dc mas sim da marvel eu não vejo coerência nenhuma nesses comentários pra mim filme foi melhor inclusive melhor que primeiro terceiro filme do christopher nolan1.0\tthis movie is one of the greatest and accurate comic book films of all time every actor in the film delivered including the minor characters robert pattison captured the perfect early and vengeful version of bruce wayne and it very clear that matt reeves read the comics and understood what batman is enough said movie1.0\tthe batman is decent first entry with great aesthetic and feel showcasing the detective work of batman was smart choice and the first time we ve seen it this methodically portrayed in film it feels fresh and unique to the batman cannon that said the movie is overlong some scenes and plot points could be cut specifically with the cat woman storyline overall it at least as good as batman begins and solid starting point for new trilogy furthermore if the sequel pairs joaquin phoenix joker with batinson the box office might just explode with the profit they make off that keen on seeing more from this new outing if they tighten up the script and throw joaquin phoenix into the mix for second movie this could well surpass the nolan trilogy of films by its conclusion 10 good action well cast and provides an entertaining plot1.0\tthe batman bleeds dark noir feel to it the whole movie that really gives us the darkest version of the caped crusader we ve seen yet what it leaves us with is visually stunning film detective mystery movie and sets up new trilogy this movie felt much more like mystery than past action batman movies and for one loved it however at times feel they tried to do too much of the action plus the mystery plus wayne backstory that feel if they would have tackled one more could have lead to more of an identity and could have reduced the run time bit feel it was 30 minutes long loved the acting in this film from farrell and dano and enjoyed pattinson take on batman but feel he tried to hard to be angsty during his bruce wayne scenes enjoyed andy serkis take on alfred who offers bit more push back to wayne than we ve seen with previous alfred and wish he was in the movie more it is not the best batman movie ever but it was good that sure will stick with people with this grim and dark tale1.0\tthe movie was perfect especially watching in theatre and the robert pattnison completely nailed it it is worth all the praise the movie was dark and at some extent great comic book movie somehow it can compete the great dark knight1.0\tobjectively this movie is not 10 10 but loved it with near hour runtime it kept me intrigued with spectacular opening of who batman is to gotham and why he does what he does this movie also showcases amazing cinematography there are so many incredible shots it uses colours and angles to display just how dark and badass batman is highly recommend one of or if not the best comic book movie along with logan and tdk1.0\tcomic lovers wanted the real dark and gritty batman and we got it it troubling moody and not too emotionally manipulative doesn feel as hollywood as nolan trilogy batman is more involved in this film and his detective work is crucial villains were excellent too more genuinely batman film than recent and for me it better than nolan hallowed films albeit ledger as joker set the bar so nice not to have cliche lines1.0\tit good that can see this masterpiece to be honest didn want to go there after watching want to go to it again the film is good my rating is 10 out of 101.0\twent to see this with my son and didn expect it to be so good it long movie but enjoyed it all along good action suspense like the vintage style of this movie very good soundtracks1.0\tagain one of the best superhero movie ever made the story the design the music photography the cast think this is masterpiece and all new take on batman loved it the noir vibes and his detective side1.0\texcellent movie for most parts very good story for most parts excellent batman depiction excellent setting timeline and atmospherics good villains less than good conclusion film makers please please please do not reveal it all in the trailers it is double edged sword one gets stoked for seeing the movie and is let down in way when there is no surprise left nonetheless excellent attempt to restart the batman franchise hope to see better second and third movie just like the dark knight franchise1.0\tthis movie is like legit 90 batman all the time 10 bruce and thats fine we have lot of detective exposure something that should have been done before but for some reason never happened this movie probably the best batman movie we have ever got detective work is comic accurate the fights are like the arkham games the best riddler on screen the story takes from the halloween storyline and mixes the riddler in the mix very well executed robert played an excellent batman thats still dealing with the truth behind his parents murder all in all this is an excellent batman film for the noir fans crime fans action fans and comic fans its just perfection in my book the only thing didn like is how it ends cuz wanted to see more we ll have to wait for the inevitable sequel1.0\tvery cool very dark very good was not normal batman movie but that made it even better something completely new to the universe hope we get more of this in the future0.0\tif you are looking for any entertainment you will be disappointed too long dark no cool gadgets no aw moments they tried something but this has not clicked at all1.0\tlove te dark knight trilogy but the thing we never saw in the batman movies was his detective skills they always called him the world greatest detective but we never saw that in the movies now we finally did1.0\tdidn really like or understand the scene where batman knocks on the front door of the iceberg lounge wanting to see penguin batman is the master of stealth being able to sneak up on people is fear fear is tool other than that one scene the movie was good btw absolutely love this version of the batmobile want one1.0\tthis movie was good but very long and drawn out no fancy bat gadgets just dark gritty batman detective type movie all about white privilege corrupt politicians and corrupt cops don watch this movie expecting typical batman action hero this character is dark reclusive and suffering from depression overall this movie wasn bad but definitely wasn anything like the dark knight trilogy would say dark knight still has this movie beat hand down am definitely concerned with the version of the joker they are going with for the next movie dark knight set that bar super high it almost looks unachievable1.0\tthe batman was visually stunning and brought depth to the detective side that hasn been seen additionally the setting up of the classic batman villains and the direct ties to the comics are fantastic1.0\tthe cinematic shots ost and the dark theme really makes this movie amazing especially the dark theme suits batman perfectly and robert pattinson did great job in this movie0.0\tnot usually superhero fan however did enjoy the dark knight joker so when saw the trailer for this it looked worth watch that was my mistake first of all think robert is great actor however you wouldn know from watching this he like the tobey mcguire emo spider man but more cringey the dialogue is terrible particularly between batman and the detective that always happens to appear out of nowhere their conversations seem like they ve been written by year old the plot is little too easy to follow they really love to over explain point out the obvious in this film don even get me started on the riddles seriously who wrote this yeah there lot wrong with this film did enjoy zoe performance however her character is given no backstory you don really know anything about her and then they just force romance between her and batman for literally no reason other than to give him someone to kiss this film is pretty trash1.0\tfinally we get batman without origin story or the joker as the fist villain of the franchise next series of film first where we get the batman pulled out from detective comics as world best detective and not the action version from the batman comics while there is incredible actions scenes peppered throughout this one make you think and stay with it and the plot and the mystery is well handled and written great acting all around the music adds to the atmosphere and moves the plot forward the cinematography is absolutely stellar just wait till you see and hear the growling of the bat mobile0.0\tthis movie was long boring and cliche the acting was not good with the exception of john turturro the story was silly unbelievable and predictable they are trying too hard stop rebooting this franchise1.0\tthe first proper live action batman movie committed to the detective side of batman fight scenes were few but were brutal comic style story line gets inspiration from the long hallowe en and hush really enjoyed the pace and style look forward to if they do twist on the court of owls or similar1.0\tthis movie had everything good movie needed great action scenes billionaire that doesn care about his well being and most importantly great villain honestly this movie was amazing all it was missing was few more action scenes and it would have been 10 for me this movie gives dark knight vibes which like not saying it as good as dark knight robert pattinson is surprisingly good batman always knew he was good actor but never saw him as good batman but here we are the music scenery story mean everything was great and expected and it must watch in your local cinema1.0\tas someone who been watching batman movies since child and read the comic really enjoyed this film very much and love the acting performance and the fight action in this film gotta tell you this movie was heavily inspired by long halloween believe this is the best batman movie made this year and would like to see where this will lead in the later sequel as this batman progresses to put it simple as that it an awesome comic book movie and does live up the hype this film made you feel like batman1.0\twill keep it short performances are fantastic especially from dano one of my favourite villains of all time the writing does great job for fleshing out its characters making sure they are distinguishable are interesting have personality and backstory great job there story was actually kind of interesting cinematography and score was utterly brilliant but have one complaint simply didn like the ending it was too basic felt like ve seen so much like it for movie that was going the way it was going was expecting more meta ending perhaps based around batman losing or something like that cementing it as single story film series it felt kind of unsatisfying this movie definitely did do amazingly well but it would ve been great to further explore the riddler and batmans connection perhaps allowing the batman to kill someone breaking his morals severing his connections with everyone making the gotham project failed experiment the people don trust him etc overall great movie though worth the watch1.0\tso the batman is probably the best comic book movie have ever seen number one it is visually stunning the designers did an amazing job bringing batman and gotham to life number two it has great story although long the story is well told and interesting the end may be little cheesy but it makes up for it with as mentioned earlier the visuals number three the cast play the characters to perfection this is the best adaptation of batman on the big screen robert pattinson is now the best batman but if you wanna see an awesome catwoman commissioner gordon or any other batman characters don worry the other characters are well done and interesting in there own way liked everyone in it and zoë kravitz and jeffrey wright shine in there respective roles now the film is great but not perfect like said it is very long if your looking for just fun quick batman movie than would not recommend although it being long does not mean it was boring it is very fun and entertaining hours other than it being long have no complaints it is well made clever interesting and beautiful film weather you just like movies your major batman fan both or even just person looking for something to do to fill some time think this is great choice definitely recommend ps knowing that batman listens to the album nevermind by nirvana in the bat cave is just awesome1.0\tnow my only concern going into this movie was pattison as batman but after seeing it was okay with it it didn bother me at all he may not have been my first choice and still don see bruce wayne as guy that have hair over his eyes but he was good zoe kravitz as cat woman was really good choice she did well in the role my favorite thing about this movie is that it was probably the most comic accurate batman movie to date it focuses on batman detective side rather than making him brawler gotham was also more accurate as instead of looking like new york it actually has gothic architecture riddler while being less accurate was more grounded and believable villain heavily based on the zodiac killer batman and alfred deciphers zodiac like messages left by him this movie was intelligently written by matt reeves by grounding it to reality and making batman who he truly was in the comics and for the main character of an almost hour movie batman doesn have whole lot of lines you see his though process and memorize on him solving the clues honestly that may be the best batman movie ve seen the music was done by michael giacchino same guy that does the music for up and rogue one star wars story the music was really creepy and intense which fit the story really well the only complaint could possibly think of is it is minutes away from being hours long and you feel it towards the end but that just little nitpick compared to the rest of the movie really did enjoy and would absolutely see another one of the same origin1.0\tthis movie was great in so many regards the performances from most of the actors were top notch the score for the film is amazing and the cinematography was just so satisfying to look at robert pattinson really crushes the role as batman the action was great and the murder mystery vibe of the movie was well executed some of the problems had was that the pacing kind of lagged in parts throughout the film also wish some of the side characters were fleshed out little better than they were my biggest complaint is that wish the main antagonist of the movie had more screen time this portrayal of the riddle was great but it could ve been iconic had he more things to do in the film overall was very pleased with this film it must watch for batman fans and superhero movie fans in general0.0\thard to know if this was decent film because the sound mixing is absolutely horrendous parts that were pure dialouge are so quiet that had to turn on subtitles or risk blowing speakers when the next obnoxiously loud scene played hate subtitles and this is not the way film should have to be watched0.0\tgothem empire the dialog was so poorly written thought biden was apart of the team the story was the generic carbon copy beat hitter the characters weren interesting and arguably poorly cast mean that butler though they had weird tech that threw me out of the moment his contacts the thumb drive that bomb bad props that made me laugh the bike the bat signal his workshop but at the same time high budget to spend in all the wrong places they ll crash building but the explosion looks awful hell there lot ll forgive but just don be boring we walked out an hour in it was just too dull to waste two more hours of our time on1.0\tthis movie exceeds my expectations everything was perfect storyline acting and mixing of music with scenes were amazing patinson took dark knight to new level of greatness thank you guys for making this amazing movie in this time1.0\tquite liked this film bit dark in places literally too dark prefer to see what going on but arty directors do this lot these days but stands up as good batman film although it is bit too long good easily be reduced to hours without losing anything well worth visit to the cinema but make no mistake nolan the dark knight is still the much better film1.0\tthis is an amazing film the acting from all actors is perfect the soundtrack is fantastic and the cinematography is stunning batman is vengeance in this film you can really feel the conflict bruce has some screen time but the whole movie revolves around batman his enemy foes as the story keeps the audience guessing and guessing you are never sure what the outcome will be until the very end1.0\tthe action the thriller the acting is all on point it gave me chills throughout really enjoyed this movie this is one of robert pattinson best action movie yet stars from me1.0\tlove every moment robert pattinson as batman is aweson and even his batmobike introduction is amazing this is his second year of his carrier as batman and thats portraited greatly in the movie1.0\thad smile on my face the whole film robert pattinson is an excellent batman and all the other roles are performed equally as well dark and grtty just as batman film should be1.0\tthis movie is exactly the kind that like and it absolutely worthy continuation of the batman series other than expected robert pattinson did remarkable performance in his role as batman1.0\tthe batman is the pov of the person who read the comics of batman and took that flesh soul and turned that into visual masterpiece strictly speaking this movie isn about bruce wayne or edward nigma it about gotham it about the filth the gore the crimes the corruption the never ending battle for power that takes place every day and how these things affect the people who live in it the movie has this moody melancholic tone that totally reflects how the batman looks at the city the characters and the actors that portrayed the characters had done their job good the score by michael giacchino was enchanting and works as hypnotic instrument that slows takes us and makes us hear gotham and its stories the cinematography by greig fraser was magnificent and captivating as director matt reeves has shown his pov on the cape crusader and boy was it great it was up high just like the bat signal at night every batman fan must watch the movie vengence but is it the best batman movie ever to know the answer you must solve this riddle when you accept what you have done you say this word no one likes it when they hear its antonym in the whole world0.0\tthe faux moody bruce wayne as played by conor oberst emo batman was the worst batman on the screen the movie it self was not bad all the other actors did fine robert pattinson cannot act he can barely creep from the shadows broodingly while wearing mask the gotham was cool but felt like the fox tv show more than something new wasn as bad as thought it would be good movie terrible batman1.0\tthe only thing that hate about this movie was that it ended trust me even if it was hours long wouldn have get bored this is so perfect the visuals and background music is treat robert pattinson literally acted with his eyes the supporting cast so too good1.0\tthis is cmon imdb mean just wow saw this in formats so far imax and dolby both were great experiences but dolby really did have more of fun effect when batman went and beat the holy moly guacamole out of bad guys loved this version of batman say it better than bales first entry now that doesn mean he better overall because this arc has just begun hopefully wb facepalm you silly silly studio please keep this going with whatever it takes for mr and rp to be happy zoe btw stole every scene she was in like her that they focused on her action like pfeifer catwoman and wasn just pretty face great flick wb you need to keep it going such fun film to watch1.0\twent to the cinema with low expectations about pattinson batman but glad to say he was awesome the photography and the colors were incredible too big applause to matt reeves as the movie was entertaining the whole time1.0\tthe new gotham feels real and depth of character grants feeling of familiarity robert pattison batman brings to life the quiet batmam that doesnt need to say anything because his eyes speak louder than his own voice0.0\tslow paced not lot of action this was the worst of the batman franchise there was guy snoring in the theatre and truth be told was lucky it wasn me had to keep shifting in my seat to stay awake they could have edited 45 minutes from this film the three stars was gift because did like zoe kravitz performance1.0\tat first little bit sceptical since it already got rebooted thousand time but guess it pretty entertaining not great batman movie but also not so bad1.0\tthis movie looks so damn good truly appreciate all the work of that crew from production design to one of the best sound designs ever witnessed am huge batman fan and after watched this movie twice think they told us very important part of his charakter dark serious and visual stunning1.0\tbatman must be ruthless and aggressive well that shown well in the movie great casting too reminds me of the dark knight rises as to how well chris had presented every scenes love dc movies just because batman character is made up well right from the intense storyline to how well it been presented especially the camera focus always fun to watch again and again still dc fan1.0\tin my opinion the dark knight was good only because of the joker honestly just liked it for joker but in this movie everyone is amazing the readdler alfred penguin and of course the best cat women every time zoe kravitz appears in screen just stop focusing and only stare at her and miss what bruce wayne was saying that was probably important to the plot also the after credit mystery is genius move from the writer1.0\tyou re only as good as your weakest link in this case the weakest link was the punch batman gave gordon strong literally every actor gave her and his plus performance matt reeves and company gave us what we always wanted the detective side and dark film done right dare say chillingly suspenful with touch of horror you could feel the fright in criminals looking into the shadows wondering if the batman was lurking waiting to come out speaking of horror the batmobile the batmobile was very very frightening in the sense that every time you think you were free and you thought you had lost the batmobile you looked back and there it was again relentlessly terrifying if you were being chased by it the cinematography was amazing very darth vaderesque how the batman boots would loudly step out of the shadows last but not least the composer michael giacchino who presence was felt every time his music started playing1.0\tin an unusual departure from any comic based movie this version of the batman went the route of delivering solid graphic novel experience rather than brashy superhero movie the story is solid noir detective drama and has plenty of mystery and few interesting surprises performances by colin farrell and paul dano as penguin and riddler were superb and the sound design of the batmobile starting gave me goosebumps but pattinson is forced to play the title role in down tempo low key moody and miserable sort of way which almost made him feel underused at the end of the experience actually felt like read graphic novel rather than seen movie0.0\tyou guessed it wokeness it just too hard to ignore and sometimes would jump in your face watching that movie you ll just notice it and that ruins the experience there was some moments where was imagining how the directors check listing all the woke things they have to add so that the crybullies on social media would be pleased it shame because the cast and the acting is fine we got great catwoman great riddler great gordon and surprisingly okayish batman in interesting plot in visually stunning movie and yet it turns out mediocre because the directors or whoever thought it was good idea to follow some silly checklists1.0\tif alfred hitchcock directed remake of chinatown in the gritty world of david fincher starring batman this grounded modern interpretation of neo noir cinema proves that comic movies can not only be good cape flicks but good films all together 100.0\tmy behind is great movie reviewer and combined with how many times my eyes are rolling in the back of my head it gives pretty good indicator of the movies watch movie conclusion my behind fell asleep after 90 minutes did not see the last hour because of my eyes involuntary rolling in the back of my head constantly and the movie just made the cardinal sin it was uninteresting and boring wanted to like it but this brought nothing new to the franchise have seen them all and liked some of them but it is enough already no more gloomy dark brooding diving in to the man psyche bla bla bla it is boring and too many movies have done it before and way better then this perhaps they should make it colourful and funny again like the 60s show maybe will return to watch more of the batman then but this is just way too pretentious and serious it is guy who dresses like bat with pointy ears good start for comedy if you ask me1.0\tits the best movie of the year it was literally piece of art if didn like it you re mistake sorry for you parents its easily better than nwh and tdk the act was perfect the plot was perfect the friendship between batman and catwoman was absolutely stunning and it shows how good batman is as detective and he ability to think and reactions its amazing how they did this movie its heavy movie that needs to be foucsed while watching because it need people with good taste and understands fast grantee that ur going to love it1.0\tdark grim and methodical was both our hero and the movie itself not quite the pace we ve come to learn from nolan but interesting enough most of the time the scenes were bit uneven as were the performances robert did well for the most part but lacked the ability to summon bruce charm when needed the double sided nature of batman and bruce got lost bit here his chemistry with batwoman wasn up to par either zoe played the selina part well but the character itself was totally uninteresting her racist remark about white people didn help you just know they have to put them in there in every single movie from hollywood these days though having teenage looking girl running for mayor was another decision they made in the same vein paul dano riddler on the other hand truly stole the show just what we expect from good batman villain excellent and unique performance the portrayal made me change my mind on the riddler as character john turturro carmine was great as well together with few great scenes the two of them raised the film to what it is and it is good one but overrated go in there expecting and you ll have good time1.0\tbatman broken check dark and gritty check solving crime check acting check this is the movie guys this is it your hooked from start to finish it not over the top where you have to reach in to your imagination but grounded well thought out and clear story you can follow1.0\tve been fan of batman my entire life have had all the toys read the comics watch the cartoons all the movies and even have batman tattoo on my chest although enjoyed the burton version and the nolan version and even the affleck version they all have thing in common they all lack that moniker of world greatest detective but not pattinson as true fan can honestly say robert pattinson is the best version of batman that ve ever seen on film although still not quite as good as the dark knight it is easily on my batman movie list1.0\tthis is easily my favorite batman since the dark knight classic movie opinion know but there reason for that just like you having every reason to go see this movie if you have any interest at all the camera work editing writing acting music it all absolutely immaculate and worth your time1.0\tthe first half was really intriguing and mysterious but by the 2nd half the mystery disappears into basically nothingness anti climatic end too to end the film robert pattinson did not shine or bring anything revolutionary to the role he was just decent alfred by andy serkis was basically an unnecessary character but zoe kravitz did good job with selena kyle the antagonist riddler had no proper intention nor justification and ended up being convoluted mess the cinematography action sequences and the music were absolutely an incredible feast to witness the film was just above average but nowhere near comparable to nolan trilogy1.0\tquite easily the best superhero movie ever made genuinly makes tdk look ordinary top class acting writing fight choreography cinematography and music for me in my top movies ever1.0\tlike said before this movie came out this movie is better than spider man on my way home the relationship between robert pattinson and zoe kravis is outstanding colin farrell as the penguin is amazing paul dano as the riddler was so traumatizing that enjoyed it the director of this movie said that it was based on the top three serial killer movies which are the zodiac killer seven and physco hope this movie continues with trilogy this movie defined the name the batman1.0\tthis movie definitely deserves it good marks and it definitely worth another watch patterson performance as bruce wayne felt very flat to me however he made up for it by giving us fast paced and exciting batman feel that other actors could have played the role just as well maybe better but either way it was good watch the other actors supporting batman in this movie definitely deserve props for keeping the story and pace flowing worth second watch but for now it sits at for me0.0\twhere you question your reality when reading those raving reviews because already know this will be the worst movie will see all year it was about an hour too long and innovation was nowhere to be found trope after trope after trope seen 1000 times and not even well used just because this time you use gritty colour grading doesn mean it innovative the soundtrack was dull misplaced and outrageously repetetive pattensons bruce wayne would be way better off in therapy against his depression than doing batman stuff would pay money to get my time back and unsee this movie1.0\tthis is the hands down the greatest batman film and comic book film of all time if you re fan of batman comics this film is your new favorite film if your just film fan then this film is master class in film making very much hope we get to live in this batman universe for years to come1.0\tmovie for people who like batman mystery thriller and tragedy the movie spot the lights on bruce wayne fighting against the evil in gotham the batman focuses on gotham and how dark and twisted it can gets rather than focusing on villains only even though love the dark knight but right now prefer the batman0.0\tthe worst movie have ever seen they have officially ruined batman for me need my hours back worst casting and the batman is now sociopathic teenager0.0\teven am batman fan this was horrible specially for me had naps during the movie actor choices for characters poor story same boring predictable batman story scenes batman chasing in rain were the worst scene literally nothing was understandable what was going on at last when batman comes from fire that was it most scenes are in dark so you have to watch it in premium movie prints otherwise you will have hard time videography average background music it was mix kind like interstellar and batman theme dialogue average batman accessories no detailing in batsuit bat vehicle and technology was average finally the depth and prestige that christian bell and nolan gave to the character was lacking in this movie1.0\tstarts well dark and as realistic as batman movie can be riddler penguin cat woman falcone all cast and acted really well the downside is it should have ended 30 mins earlier won put spoilers but you ll see there was no need to keep it going robert is good actor but he awful in this zero range and just miserable all the time however the real disappointment for me was the close range direct gunshots explosions that didn hurt him it bat suit not brick wall that and scene where he was examined by doctor with his mask left on was just so stupid it ruined the movie given they were trying so hard for it to be realistic and actually doing really well gave it an but it could have been 10 with some better direction editing watch it but set your expectations little lower than the hype1.0\twent to see the movie with very low expectation but man it exceeded on every angle pattison best bats so far and yes ve seen all of them several times dark twisted gothic ve enjoyed every single moment of the movie the plot was freaking amazing kravitz and farell were outstanding can find anything bad about it or maybe yes one thing can watch this with my yo as he big batman fan too good job dc can wait for the next movie0.0\tno storyline the baddy was unmemorable to say it kindly no charm or charisma from batman unlike christian bale he looked like teenager with bad make up wish could watch it1.0\ttrue masterpiece indeed loved it no wonder why he is called the world greatest detective every actor nailed it the ending will blow your mind0.0\tthe worst batman ever is not worth it to watch this movie in the cinemas really usually don give bad comments but this time basically couldn help it0.0\tno more woke stuff plz there good film hidden between what is nothing but self indulgent filler unfortunately the filler makes up at least of the run time curious in the director insistence he wanted to create realistic version of batman rather than superhero think to achieve that you need to at least imply your hero is somewhat hurt or even out of breath after taking on gang of gun wielding thugs assume actually showing blood when someone is having their skull caved in would help too you also need to show emotion of some sort what we ended up with was wish version of se7en mixed with blade runner disastrous narration1.0\tpleased satisfied expectations exceeded 10 10 story was well considered dialogue was 95 audible which is good for an loud action movie quality fight scenes and an iconic car chase acting was all round solid robert pattinson was bit emo ish but didn mind it as it made him appear slightly more menacing and bit unhinged adding depth to the character the wet dystopian gotham city was highly atmospheric and eye catching throughout the film score was second to none not perfect film but massive upgrade from the batman vs superman shambles movie haven seen but have heard bad things1.0\tthis movie is the best and will be path breaker for dc best direction best acting only thing missed is the strength and power of batman in earlier movie he used to be strong and his machine were awesome but in this it disappointed little bit but overall great experience0.0\thave never seen full batman movie before ive seen pieces of few of them and am firmiliar with some of the villains and the general premise of batman this movie is exactly what expected is that good thing or bad thing well for me if hour movie is this predictable consider that bad thing catwoman and batman have exactly the interactions you expect them to alfred and batman have exactly the interactions you would expect them too absolutely nothing in this movie wow me or suprised me in any way tldr this is what you should find if you look up batman in the dictionary its good at being batman but it doesn take any chances and doesnt have any suprises thats not enough for me1.0\tpeople are voting badly because of the hate to robert pattinson amazing movie noir style beautiful ll admit raised an eyebrow when saw that pattinson was cast but eat my words he was awesome and hopefully will play the part few more times imdb please check the reviews1.0\tthe batman was great in many ways but disappointing in others say the batman is great movie but at the same time wouldn say it great batman movie but it definitely in the top three throughout watching the the batman couldn help but feel like the movie was lacking something and really couldn say what something just felt off throughout the film ve spent the good part of the twelve months or so looking forward to this film and really think it struggled to deliver my expectations however was impressed by many things in this film such as excellent casting especially with jeffery wright as commissioner gordon and colin farrell as the penguin little details throughout the film like seeing batman outfit obtain damage that doesn disappear in the next scene one thing loved in this film was the gorgeous cinematography that brings gotham city to life perfectly there was so many things matt reeves and the teams behind the batman did just right which helped make the three hour runtime stay interesting as expected though it does have its hiccups such as the plot feeling bloated at times or over complicated and some scenes are unnecessarily dragged out which is ironic because the most enjoyable scenes feel lot more fast paced and don feel long enough especially the fight scenes believe if the film was cut bit shorter and some slow paced scenes were cut shorter the batman would seem more streamlined and less tedious at certain points when the film feels to slow this is batman movie like no another with an original tone style and take any batman fan would be silly to miss this film the soundtrack cinematography and casting is perfect and suits this iteration giving it unique feel like never before personally wouldn say this is the best batman movie out there as much as had confidence but it still doesn disappoint and recommend this film to anyone with an interest in dark comic book movies with violent action and can enjoy complicated murder mystery my imdb score 10 viewed at odeon cinema 221.0\tthis movie is gritty and dark have been waiting to see batman like this for very long time yes there are few things don quite like however the movie is masterpiece the cast is fantastic and gotham is scary dark and what picture when reading the detective comics look forward to much more1.0\tgood attempt but it got lot to live up to against the last batman movies which still outshine this film robert pattinson plays very well has batman the riddler is poor villain and was even laughable at times all in all good film though but it needs to step its game up to get anywhere near the dark knight1.0\tpattison is truly awesome actor that brings realistic version of batman the cinematography is so brilliant done so this movie feels so fresh and experimental wish that matt reeves continues to do one or two more batman movie1.0\tthis is what you should expect from batman film noir film delving into the under belly of gotham city very dark disturbing adventure this is most certainly the darkest knight we have gotten yet there is no bruce wayne in this movie since he has been so consumed by his alter ego or is bruce now his alter ego this film did everything was expecting and brought fresh type of look and feel to comic book films very dark and brutal this is without doubt the most beautifully shot comic book film ve ever seen it is absolutely stunning this is an instant classic and will go down as one of the greats1.0\tloved this batman come back from robert pattinson cobainish presence to the music to the acting by the whole ensamble especially paul dano maniacal perfection and colin farrell uncanny italian mafia boss impersonation zoe kravitz is perfection as catwoman she was born to play her the only reason didn give it 10 stars is the subtle political propaganda which seems to be ever present in all movies of recent times it has become an inevitable part of every movie and it sucks because art should be independent and free in its mindset and creation as liberal artist myself really wish politics would stay out of every single nook of our existence and let art breathe1.0\treally great batman movie really wanted to rate 10 stars but was bit disappointed that there wasn wee bit more romance great action violence level though1.0\tthe cinematography the soundtrack the acting this movie is the only which proves batman as the world greatest detective it more of noir movie than superhero movie an amazing cinema experience1.0\thell of photography beautiful dark featured batman movie ever what comeback the storyline was superb and mindblowing to more batman movies with robert pattinson1.0\tdeeply engrossing action packed brutal closest comic book dark knight ever action sequence was smoothly choreographed with ultimate batman score gotham city is beautifully shown with corruption and lots of crimes acting of riddler is top notch1.0\tbest crime thriller pattinson acting is great the whole movie is well written and people with mind of year old won like it because they won understand the writing1.0\tit is not an interpretation of batman that we got used to seeing form other reboots felt like this was more original and certainly better than what expected the car chase the action scenes superb old school batman not that old to be ridiculous and that new to be something else1.0\tthis is it dc leverage this great movie now or it over last chance matt did an excellent job directing acting writing and directing were all fantastic1.0\twhat can say that hasn already been said the fresh perspective on this classic character the originality of the story the cast the score music the character arcs the set designs the costumes makeup etc are all top notch if not for the stupid woke white privilege comment and somewhat drawn out ending this movie would be damn near perfect ignore the bad reviews that focus on plot holes or on pattinson version of bruce wayne nearly every movie ever made has plot holes and this is different take on bruce wayne batman which also focuses on his second year of being batman1.0\tthe batman is truly masterpiece with superb direction by matt reeves and awesome portrayal of the caped crusader by robert pattinson the comic book adaptation thrillingly bends the rut and indeed delivered the chills1.0\thave now watched the movie thrice looking for every detail possibly can and am not going to lie have not been disappointed the movie is so well crafted the cast is spot on in their depiction you genuinely get the sensation of grim gotham where batman is still struggling to understand his role and learning as the character evolves in my opinion this movie is the second best move ever made on the caped crusader after tdk of course it is little mix of all its predecessors while being still original in the what it wants to achieve with the characters and the world1.0\tout of the world screenplay and cinematography in the first half the batman is lively gothic dark and keeps you on toes all the time great build up for potential blockbuster series1.0\tjust saw the movie and it is everything imagined when would read the comics masterpiece action crime thriller chemistry the emotions just everything is great ignore the negative reviews just critics complaining about the movie bring too dark and violent or bored it is dark because it batman darkness and grit are the two trademarks of batman really can wait for the sequel1.0\tthis movie is totally different from nolan trilogy loved it too robert pattinson provides an intense performance you will like the hero but you will love the man behind the batman paul dano is simply amazing1.0\tthere are some truly stunning moments in this movie absolutely love the portrayal of batman as you think there may be some sameness to some degree but couldn be further from the truth pattinson does terrific job of crafting his own vibe but the overall feel of the movie truly stands alone credit to reeves my only critique would be once riddlers grand plan is revealed it really didn come off too earth shattering lots of build up for it but ultimately enjoyed the ride taking the audience there than the actual reveal support your local theater and see it on the big screen1.0\tthis movie was the best batman movie robert pattinson definitely killed it as bruce wayne and batman loved how matt reeves did with this movie and hope he does more batman movies in the future like this1.0\tthe batman is everything batman should be dark gritty gruesome brutal it is like his predecessors the dark knight trilogy more than just comic movie and edges more towards psychological thriller it is almost hours long but never ever feels boring the music is just amazing it adds so much to the great cinematography it gives that dark gothamesque feeling that is needed for good batman robert pattinson is great batman he has the voice on lock he fights brutally and his suits fits like glove did miss the bruce wayne playboyness but to be honest this movie was not asking for it it was supposed to be dark and gritty not flashy and fun my favorite actor in the movie was paul dano though what performance as the riddler we often got jokers already but this was the first great the riddler although not comic accurate loved his psyche and the way he kept us on edge the entire movie cat and mouse esque how he kept batman chasing him and giving these insane riddles last but not least zoe kravitz is such work of art she was great catwoman and has mesmerizing amount of sex appeal red hair short haired blonde pink brunette she does it all and stays mesmerizing throughout sexiness at its finest which is important for catwoman really loved this movie and expect this pattinson version to be just as succesfull as the dark knight trilogy hoping for more considering the end of the movie no spoils1.0\tjust love when the true comic version comes back with vengeance don compare with dark knight series it had more captivating storyline but this movie definitely personifies comic characters whole lot better had my doubts on rob but that jawline was tailor made for the mask deeper darker version of batman at an early stage can wait to see it develop more intensely already hyped for this franchise1.0\tpersonally liked ben affleck but this has become new favorite batman of mine amazing iteration of the batman so far from cinematography to the music score and just purrfect the runtime and direction does justice to the movie in every single way it is the best movie from matt reeves till date1.0\tthe most comic accurate batman and the movie was beautifully directed it more like art eagerly waiting for 2nd part to come as soon as possible loved the music direction and screenplay0.0\treally wanted to like this movie but it was not to be to me several things don get going for the movie the cast is not right patinson tries hard but is just not convincing enough as batman or bruce wayne catwoman has bad hairstyle the story is long and drawn it could have been more tightly woven the climax does not make sense what makes even less sense is zack snyder version of the character has been abandoned for this version which is dark and similar in terms of visual style and content have lost faith in warner brothers1.0\tnon spoiler review the batman is 2022 crime drama detective noir story directed by matt reeves and written by matt reeves and peter craig the movie is phenomenal from start to finish the movie is very complex and every shot every line and every beat is purposeful and adds either to the story character or genre for hours and 55 minutes the movie feels long but in good way it not in the sense that it paced badly it feels longish because you feel part of the narrative and keeps you hooked in the story awaiting what will come next major part is also due to the spectacular cinematography by greg fraiser and matt reeve simple but complex the movie doesn rely on quick cuts and fast camera movements the camera is rather still or moves in simple up down left right movement choosing to hold on scene and let everything set in and even without the fancy camera techniques the movie still looks gorgeous and can be creative with how the camera is utilised robert pattinson as batman is of course spectacular his roles in the lighthouse and good time have cemented him as an all time great actor evoking so much pain and disconnect from everyone else with just glance you can feel everything just by looking at his eyes zoe kravitz gives great performance as selina kyle not as iconic as michelle pfeiffer however is far more complex and more memorable than anne hathaway colin farrell what hasn been said about his performance he is one of the major highlights of the movie can fathom the fact that this is colin farrell wouldn be surprised if it was another actor and they say it colin farrell jeffery wright plays great gordan and has really fun and interesting dynamic with batman paul dano is actually insane in this role at times he is kind of scary kind of combination between the zodiac killer and jigsaw when you actually see his face he pulls off one of his best performances the film is deliberate and masterful it surpasses the dark knight by quiet bit reckon it focus on the detective aspect adds hook that keeps you in the movie overall highly recommend don listen to the negative reviews if the genre is for you you will absolutely love this movie spoiler review the film starts where the first trailer for the movie the death of political leader the first shot alone is rather jarring when you don expect it the first person perspective of the riddler already grabs your intrigue as he watches this man in his apartment the movie especially at the start gives you kind of horror tone the way he appears behind the man and he just stands their watching him it had the theatre on edge from the very beginning from their the movie gives narration from batman talking about the city and how it crime infested through this we see criminals around the city doing criminal stuff but when batman talks about how he is fear and that the signal in the sky it not just signal its warning for them the signal comes on and the criminals stare into dark ally or corner he may not be their but his presence is felt immediate chills that gives you butterflies in your chest then when he shows up heavy footsteps and fading in from the shadows to beat up the criminals with that famous beatdown from the trailer absolutely amazing the first 15 minutes entirely is peak cinema from their we actually start the narrative and feeling we will get for the rest of the movie batman and the gcpd investigate the crime scene at this point the cops don trust batman and clearly have distaste for him only commissioner gordan trusts him we meet gordan and establish his relationship and even how he treats his bruce wayne persona kind of recluse and keeps to himself batman and gordan continue the case which leads to the introduction of penguin and the iceberg lounge this club in the city that also secretly holds corrupted officials from their we also meet selina kyle who works for the owner of the business carmine falcone played by john turturro batman is their for this lady that seemed to have walked home with the victim with sneaking suspicion he follows selina home whom is keeping the lady selina goes to the apartment at the start of the movie to grab documents and files batman follows and have bit of scuffle taking him back to her place it is found in wreck and the lady was taken selina and batman decide to work together to uncover what is going on in the iceberg lounge selina only helping to find her friend after getting frustrated with batman she loses contact with him and leaves after gaining bit of information outside riddler waits outside waiting in da car by the name gil colson played by peter sarsgaard he is attacked the day before the funeral of the first victim bruce wayne makes rare appearance at the funeral believing the riddler to be there gil colson breaks in with his car causing stir batman goes in when everyone evacuated answering two out of three riddles but gil colson won reveal who he works for and chooses to die taken back to gcpd after the explosion batman has to go in alone since the gcpd refuses to work with him escaping the gcpd with his grapple gun and glide suit he works with gordan to uncover the mystery the mystery leads to penguin leading to the best action sequence of the movie the batmobile pursuit penguin reveals some information revealing that bruce wayne is the next target leading to batman not making it in time to stop his place from blowing up severely harming alfred in the process batman goes into overdrive and finds out the next location the burned down orphanage batman has the revelation that his family is corrupt and it is then revealed to the world batman goes to see alfred and they discuss why he is batman and how it was done for his family but alfred gives bruce the truth but his family didn want anyone to be killed the signal is called and batman and gordan find it was selina who called the signal revealing his father to be behind it all the death of her friend and everything selina goes to kill him and batman fights through the club and stops her capturing falcone he is shot and killed by the riddler and it leads to his arrest his plan is revealed and gotham is flooded with his minions shooting up the place the new mayor is being kept batman comes in and with little trial and help from selina stop them batman decides to put fear aside and help the innocence stuck in the debris the movie ends with another narration from batman about being someone else someone that inspires hope batman and selina go their separate ways and that it the batman is thrilling and full of intrigue and tension some have an issue with the ending but think it as consistent as the rest of the movie think the issue people had was that the movie has bit of finality and starts to slow down the suddenly it picks back up again and the audience needs to adjust again but on second viewing it is very seamless and not problem regardless even the aspects of the film understand people won like can see how they could have changed it think it the re watches that make it better and more seamless overall it must see and you must watch even if your not batman fan1.0\tgo and see for yourself eventually you ll find new things about batman the caped cruseder he really is watched this movie for times and the more watch it gets me more addicted finally matt reaves you re goddamn lengend1.0\tdark grim brooding epic the batman may be the best one yet ve been fan of the caped crusader since was kid and this movie satisfied me to the core highly recommend1.0\tit is interesting to see batman detective side but it would be hard for this batman to fit in justice league the old dark knight fighting style would be more realistic but it could be also tripping this batman in his own universe1.0\tthe story is interesting and keeps you engaged the darkness of pattinson batman is fresh and overly due really enjoyed the nolan trilogy but there is some room at the top for another batman excellent performances throughout cinematography was on point modern classic the length does begin to get painful around hours in but that could be because was at midnight showing on work night1.0\tthe whole film is whole masterpiece the riddler is amazing am speechless and my emotions goes up and down with my bestfriend must see in theaters1.0\twas blown away by how good this movie was it is so dark and gritty it felt like noir detective thriller of yester year so good pattison and dano were brilliant and colin farrell penguin was genuinely amazing1.0\tthat movie is so masterpiece becoming greatest movie ever disagreement that star its must be stars its very so dark very intense very mystery and thrilled very horror its very incredible movie robert pattinson is the one the best batman ever seen story and director did and amazing job everything is just so perfect1.0\teven though it almost hours wouldn change anything about it not going to compare it to the nolan batman trilogy but it definitely hangs in there with it just as good1.0\tthis film was something else went in the theatres expecting to see something decent but left feeling as if have witnessed one of the greatest superhero films of all time huge true crime fan so seeing the riddler in very familiar outfit true crime fans will know was very creepy but amazingly done so excited to see where matt reeves takes us next bravo to the entire cast and crew for achieving masterpiece1.0\tgreat movie and awesome cast the storyline was fun and felt like late nineties movie the chemistry between the batman and gordon were outstanding bravo to all of you1.0\tdont usually review movies but this its the best movie ive ever watched omg even rewatched the movie and it felt 10000x better after rewatching everything is 10 10 for me bout to rewatch it for the 3rd time im so inlove1.0\tgreat and engaging movie showing the real world greatest detective in action you will be immersed from start to finish the supporting cast was phenomenal1.0\tthis is absolutely unequivocally unmistakably surreal cinematic experience which longed for since an awfully long time was overwhelmed and blown away last night although my expectations have skyrocketed due to the positive reviews had been reading in the past weeks but thankfully wasn disappointed at all this masterwork by matt reeves is yet another proof why the story of batman is the greatest comic book story ever this isn the usual comic book movie to have fun with this is suspense thrilling drama that has many things in common with movies like se7en and the usual suspects than the previous versions of batman movies don want to spoil the storyline to you by getting into specific details to back up my argument but this is the detective batman movie ve always wanted to see with heavy film noir elements to the story just right when thought that jared leto had probably the greatest transformation in house of gucci collin farrel as the penguin in the batman was literally unrecognizable to the point you mistake him for robert de niro with that superb acting and delivery of speech but generally the whole cast was great especially paul dano who stole the show at the end this is probably the greatest cast acting ve seen in years ultimately one simply cannot miss the opportunity to praise the top tier cinematography by greig fraser who brilliantly managed to create dark gritty visuals and atmosphere that fits well with the story ops forgot something in the way mmmm1.0\tit 10 10 movie only mcu fans are hating because it better then almost every marvel movie ever made they just don like seeing movie competing with no way home1.0\tstory plot it very long and felt it just after the midpoint but it is good story originality there lot of cliches the characters have all been on the silver screen before and it good guy vs bad guy hollywood movie acting everyone was brilliant pattinson did great job but think paul dano outperformed everyone cinematography gotham looked really cool the rain effect really added the right emotions0.0\tnearly fell asleep this was the worst batman ve ever seen and pattison really bad choice the movie is waaaaaaaaay too long and just plain boring where are all the batman gadgets and toys gone how come batman forgot how to fight in this one1.0\tdetective based superhero with serious pacing and duration issues and yet delivered an excellent batman movie fans deserved greig visuals reeves direction and paul and robert perfomances was lit on screen spl mention to michael giacchino1.0\tthis was thrilling film different but dark as well the fact that it whole investigation of maniac serial killer is really good batman is detective not like the previous films that everything clear not that kind of chills and suspense the fights and killings are as well realistic and brutal it will give you goosebumps the film feels as realistic as imaginative it has this mirror technique they talking openly about the world corruptions that happens to our world but as well you feel that it an imaginary city0.0\thow slow can film go if batman walked bit quick and spoke bit quicker you could easily cut an hour out of this film batman walks around depressed like he out of the adam family the storyline is so rubbish and shallow and it develops so slowly everyone talks so slowly it just boringly slow it not drama or building the suspense it just slow batman is constantly getting things wrong in the film and he comes across bit thick and as for the depth of character he has few lines that are simple and most of the time he just walks around with his mouth shut staring at things with his eyes wanted to walk out of the cinema after 30 minute absolute load of rubbish no dark knight1.0\tthe batman is movie which positioned itself to take you in dark twisted world with well built narrative and stunning visuals human side of the characters especially batman and catwoman are shown with real emotions and rare story where it encapsulates that batman is flawless pragmatic and pessimistic aspects goes side by side robert pattinson had shown stellar performance as batman all other cast had done tremendous part to excel the movie1.0\tthe movie got really boring then would imagine it to be all have to say and confirm after watching this movie is that now have realized that no movie even from dc itself can ever top the dark knight trilogy matt reeves really tried to make this movie bloated which hate at times this movie was really great but then somehow falls on its stupid face1.0\tll start of by stating huge batman fan love the dark knight trilogy and bale gives an excellent performance this is completely different take in this feature we see more youthful batman bruce who has only taken the role of the dark knight within the last two years it provides very dark and edgy experience we see alot more focus on the detective side of bats robert thought gave an excellent performance very raw and voilent the riddler was fantastic only criticism it could have ended 30 mins earlier but overall solid 10 for me absolutely loved it from start the finish1.0\tthat was 10 10 this is how batman movie should have always been made absolutely brilliant pattinson gives real down to earth change then the full on hollywood style gimic character krazitv as catwoman shows very vunerable side to character that is more than pretty face also the riddle nearly steals the show with his magnificent acting especially near the final scenes of the movie so so good1.0\tbeen itching to see this but was dreading 3hr movie film had me focused from the beginning and didn let me let go until the end not once did think about break more popcorn another coffee even forgot needed pee let face michael keaton was great christian bale was also great but the silly batman voice was just annoying however robert pattinson does very good job and he could very well be the best batman yet yep said it been waiting while for this vision of batman to come to the screen perfect and itching for more1.0\tsat on the cinema thinking this was gonna be some sort of overrated overhyped superhero movie if superhero movie is what you re expecting you ll be utterly disappointed but no this movie will leave you gasped through the whole time this is murder mystery with deciphers everywhere the villain the mob everything is on point this movie would be the outcome if the movie se7en and batman movie had baby this isn your traditional comic book movie this is unlike anything you ve ever seen before definitely don recommend it if you re not ready to see bodies everywhere and people getting threatened to death and savagely bludgeoned or if you are anything below 13 loved everything about it and even thought it hours it has lot of pace to it giving it 10 because it beautiful and you haven seen anything like it1.0\tthe best cinamatic experience have ever witnessed the tone was on point music was great and the cast was great the action scscenes was pleasing to watch and intense didn even feel it was hours long1.0\treally good batman movie it takes more detective noir approach to batman lot of good easter eggs in the film is awesome my only complaint is that wish batman would break more bones abs knock more teeth other than that great movie1.0\tbelieve that pattinson played the role of batman really well thoroughly enjoyed the unique take of the story and was gripped the whole way through1.0\treally really enjoyed this version of the batman robert pattinson does more than justice or vengeance to this character his performance is outstanding as is colin farrel as the penguin so good in fact actually thought it was robert deniro at first not one bad performance from any of the cast andy serkis his usual excellence has bit of the michael caine about him zoe kravitz is an absolute standout catwoman and geoffrey wright is brilliant lt gordon do hope follow up to the batman is made with this cast ensemble would be very happy0.0\tdont really want to say much it was bad movie trying too hard it looks like they did not want to make good movie but all they were thinking was that they need to beat chris nolan guess what they failed big time1.0\tfrom start to finish every piece of dialogue every camera shot all the stuff batman looks at or the camera shows us all of these things are clues throughout the movie sometimes you see them sometimes you don realize what you saw until batman reveals it and moves on to the next step it very satisfying to see and the amount of twists and turns that happen in this movie is astounding you don know what gonna happen next because the movie throws so much at you that you keep getting misled into believing whatever is shown to you but that rarely the actual truth the entire movie as whole focuses on discovering the truth both about gotham and about who the villain is plus the fact that it noir detective style film anyways it really drills this into you without shying away from how grotesque the reality of gotham really is was actually feeling bit underwhelmed by the fact that none of the actors stood out in my head but realized later that the actors didn need to stand out the characters need to stand out and they do was so immersed in the story wasn seeing robert pattinson was seeing batman was seeing the bat doing detective work talking in smooth tone spitting hella fire one liners loved it it worked was never concerned about who the actor was just about what was happening overall great movie highly recommend it pretty fast hours you won have to worry about feeling bored halfway through giving it an because am definitely super impressed and enjoyed the movie but it didn blow my mind just enjoyed it lot1.0\tthought about it every single character was phanomenal the batman was one of the best if not the best movie ve ever seen everything from the plot to the characters to the cinematography1.0\tmovies stands tall and does such good job at keeping you captivated with the cgi of most super hero movies these days story was well done tone characters and depth all in one would highly recommend watching1.0\tthe story the visuals the sound the acting of each and every character was top notch batman fans would absolutely love this dark psychological thriller1.0\twhen the batman flies from the pages of comic book to the big screen is the batman movie my god robert pattinson is so awesome and nailed it as batman zoe kravitz and jeffery wright were expectional michael giacchino music is the soul for the film and paul dano killed it as riddler can wait to explore more of this particular universe0.0\tonly positive thing can say about this film was it made me take back everybody ve said about the ben affleck batman films it was lesson to show sometimes in life things can be done worse hope alone and just had very subjective idea about this film twilight resurrection if you have never seen any batman films you may like it that the only way1.0\tabsolutely loved this movie cinematography was amazing and the portrayal of the characters was also good the storyline was very interesting and not boring at all definitely my new favourite movie1.0\tsorry but this movie is over dark knight and everything other batman movies don think it the best batman actor they could have got maybe they could have got christian bale again0.0\tbatman kaye ghar pe dail wala landline phone aur riddler iphone pe video call kar raha hai sreen colored billboard hai but paper black and white aa raha hai bandar pe cinema banae wale se kya expect kar sakte hai pattinson neither looked billionaire nor superhero am just giving stars also because of good cinematography1.0\tthis is my first time writing review but feel that this movie should get all the credit because it was absolutely outstanding the first will say is yes it 3h long so naturally people are going to complain and maybe even walk out fall asleep for myself was on the edge of my seat the entire time there wasn single moment where thought hey this getting too long now or they didn really need to add that in what love about this movie is how real it feels sure nolan batman series were incredible but there were elements in those movies that took you out of that realness for me like the bat suit because just that little bit too clean or super high tech gadgets that didn really fit the tone of the movie in my mind this movie is dark it grungy gritty and powerful really have to applause matt reeves on an outstanding job as well as robert pattinson and all supporting cast members every single one of their performances was incredible yes mean what said this movie in my eyes was better than no way home and that saying something because adore that movie1.0\tthe hour runtime put me off for while but so glad decided to sit down and watch this it was quite dark take on batman which thoroughly enjoyed robert pattinson brought new spin to bruce wayne he wasn as suave as some previous actors but he did solid job and deserves praise the movie was very well made and even though it was long movie it kept me interested until the very end paul dano did good job as the villain and enjoyed the story line all in all out of 10 think is fair for this and would definitely recommend this movie0.0\tfor the first time have lost respect for the batman franchise patterson was the worst pick for this role and honestly all the cast was wrong it was so boring and long that wanted to leave so sad batman dead as far as am concerned0.0\tnothing that good really wtf is up with that director you wanna see new thing you wanna feel it and really noting can tell that is new or good1.0\tthis certainly was movie wasn it maybe 20 minutes too long but movie all the same some of the pacing could have fixed by simply trimming down the more suspenseful scenes as the conclusion to them was clearly telegraphed it takes batman two minutes to slowly walk over to rat cage okay sure that being my only gripe with an otherwise incredible film the whole cast give flawless performances grungier more scrappy batman is an excellent take and robat battinbat is perfect in the role eye makeup and all the right amount of horror elements action and mystery mixed together in what will go down as one of the greats1.0\tthe movie was really mind blowing pattinson nailed it and knew he wouldnt disappoint you can feel the love and spirit done by all crew members from the directors to the light technicians the soundtrack is beautiful with mixing touch of noir thriller and horror vibes which can be felt in numerous scenes all the stars performed greatly especially collin farell and zoe the downlet to me for that movie was the cold relationship between alfred and bruce which was highly emphsaized in the nolan movies but lacked in reeves movie overall it was wonderfull ride and thrilling new approach to batman which really enjoyed 101.0\the has his flawes yet he is complete circumstances made him feeble yet he is so strong amazing story telling out of the world cinematography visual treat1.0\tcatwoman was worth it true actress and insanely beautiful batman was alright but didn leave an impression penguin was on point the rest of the characters quite forgettable1.0\tthere are generally two types of good movies the ones that make you sit on the edge most of the time and the ones that bore you in theaters but award you when you watch them again matt reeves batman is definitely the later kind however it is not compliment the stunning visuals of gotham city and pattinson subtle and vigorous performance add to the overall quality of this film but the plot line is so cliched and uncreative this film doesn even build up anything that stimulates emotion or reason like we saw in batman begins it is piled up with cinematic lighting that embellishes insignificant dialogues and backstories also for non native speakers the mumbling actors will drive you crazy especially pattinson character who doesn adduct his vocal cords when he speaks literally all the time and this is not joke if you are not hardcore batman fan meaning if you only or never watched nolan dark knight trilogy and you are not willing to pay 20 dollars to sit in the rambunctious theater for hours with numb and tedious dialogues just to see few masterfully colored and composed shots this movies is definitely not for you1.0\tjust being honest at first not sure pattinson would be good choice for this movie because kind of my bias since don really into the twilight saga and that saga aura cannot be removed even once from pattinson himself and well as predicted he didn not good choice but great choice and truly admitted he is such marvellous actor and he nailed this movie my short review it wasn just superhero story but more than that well developed drama the bat and the cat relationship the riddler himself noir and dark scene that affected the movie so much this one you should give try even though you don like pattinson as was1.0\tif you have played the arkham games you will definitely love this movie it masterpiece being marvel fan would like to say the batman was better than nwh hats off to matt reeves1.0\tthis movie was amazing in every way the plot 10 10 the characters 10 10 acting 10 10 cinematography 10 10 soundtrack 10 10 firmly believe that this movie is better than the dark knight and know that very hard to do 100 recommend this movie1.0\tthis movies delivers on every level making the dark knight exactly what it needs to do cause fear in other everything from the gothic feel of gotham to the riddler sick and twisted plans are amazing1.0\tthis is the batman the greatest batman movie ever made pattinson is the batman it is horror movie with superhero twist and detective side 10 101.0\tan aesthetically pleasing take on the character of batman robert pattinson truly embraces the role of the masked crusader pros the most noticeable difference between this dark thriller compared to other batman movies is the beautiful use of cinematography the ill lit tone of the entire movie is depicted through the darkness of the shots emphasizing the dark presence of batman the balance between the physical and detective sides of batman is well done while every actor in the movie clearly did their best work pattinson take on young batman and vengeful bruce wayne is phenomenal the on screen chemistry between pattinson and zoe kravitz is applaudable as well it was gratifying to see an ending where batman love and optimism for gotham city are reciprocated cons the way that this movie was filmed the storyline of the story is sometimes hard to follow due to the continuous use of darkness in the shots some viewers may be deterred from enjoying the movie because of this there are times when the contrast between darkness and light is excessive the movie is very enjoyable when you understand what is happening but sometimes the audience may fall behind and it is difficult to catch up also make sure to use the restroom before viewing the ending of the movie could have been done better the main villain purpose for doing what he does is skewed with the final events small critique of the movie is that the relationship between alfred and bruce could have been better developed before certain event happens to alfred did not feel as much of an emotional attachment in this movie to this important side character as did with michael caine alfred summary overall this movie is daring take on the batman character and definitely competes with the performance of the previous the dark knight movie1.0\tprefect portrayal of the early years of the batman and his mental situation by robart pattinson such great actor mett reeves did really good job about story telling and direction one of my favourite movie1.0\tbeware dc please do not screw this one superb story well driven characters incredible acting the best on screen chemitry between batman and gordon the third act was little out of context it should have ended in the arkhamn scene bravo this should be the best batman opportunity dc have in years to develop young batman to his fully potencial loved it the wat the movie breaths it has it own personality wish they will use more alfred in the next ones explain little bit wathever he does in this version and also little bit of contex in bruce training go see it tiger0.0\teven if it was his second year as batman movie was like low budget horror film of parody was falli by cause it didn get grab like normal movies does1.0\tmatt reeves the batman is good but unfortunatley good is all can muster the film suffers from several issues that undermine it but as whole it step in the righ direction the film is gorgeously gothic and many elements are so good it feels like they ve lept straight from the page the design and feel of this film often times feels like it came from my dreams as lifelong batman fan the film certainly has issues that do ruin it in areas but the way see it this film is an experiment to test if this kind ve batman could work and have to say it absolutely does with some issues addressed sure the next batman will be one to remember recommend this film to any batman fans out there the first 15 mins alone are worth the watch but my advice bring neck pillow1.0\tjust watched this amazing batman movie unlike the other batman movies this batman movie mainly has aggressive and detective version of batman pattinson has done great work putting the batman character up to his standards really like the action filled fighting scenes in this movie for me those action sequences are better than the bvs movie warehouse fight scene zoë kravitz also did good job on the catwoman character as well one thing noticed in the movie was that in the movie she was never called as catwoman throughout the movie its because the movie basically focused on the year version of the batman so she actually doesn get the nickname as catwoman yet in cinematic vise there are beautiful captures of cinematic shots and camera angle takes and signs which really enjoyed throughout the movie if you haven watched the movie yet encouraging everyone to go to the theater and get the full experience of this magnificent movie0.0\ttotal waste of time the genre of this movie should not be action its drama and slow burn unnecessary swaggy music trying to show that cartoon new batman as serious sell out disappointed1.0\tnew twist on the story robert pattinson batman is breath of fresh air after ben affleck movie the atmosphere of the movie had me on my seats the supporting cast is also amazing paul dano is great riddler1.0\treally impressive and immersive film as dark as good as the twist really enjoyed this movie best one of 2022 so far and lot more down to earth then most of the batmans as well as great film1.0\tlove this movie it so good and filled with so much action and mystery highly recommend this to anyone who hasn seen it yet or is big batman fan0.0\tlike all the worst follow on series it seems they ve made the mistake of trying to replicate the good features of the previous series so pattinson tries to speak with gravelly voice like bale but he too young scrawny and imo to pull it off his butler is also trying to sound like michael cane the fight seens are so far behind nolan the gadgets are rubbish and the batmobile looks like clapped out old mustang the script is laughable gotham is just portrayed as somewhere it rains alot and it always night time the scariest thing about the villains is they wear sunglasses indoors there is one scene that is so bad it is laughable batman lifts up piece of wood and people who seemed fine walked out from behind it cue emotional music and children looking up at him with wonder for the sake of balance catwoman is good and the riddler is ok given all theses agonisisng features the film is way too long very nearly walked out in hindsight wish had1.0\tcut half hour of the run time speed up the pace within acts should only be lulls one to separate each act and then couple mini lulls for exposition this movie had four or five lulls within each act that dumbed and slowed the pace down way too much every time it felt like the story was moving along it would slow back down prefer movies that build the tension and action to crescendo at the end of each act1.0\tthis is masterpiece an intricate crime noir plot driven by great performances and camera work adapting batman best solved cases pattinson is by far the most terrifying vulnerable and human batman never loved the scenes where he teams up with gordon to solve the riddles just like the batman remember from my childhood watching him chase the penguin on his batmobile was one hell of an experience see major complaints from many critics calling it broody and dark think that is how it is supposed to be and although it hrs long have never felt it as was hooked the entire time the haunting score by michael giacchino the neverending rain the orange hues and deep dark reds made the distorted city of gotham scarier than ever before the riddler reminded me of the infamous zodiac killer and he shines in the role the penguin gordon catwoman falcone and alfred were amazing throughout this is cinema true to it genre comic book filmmaking detective noir that reminded me of the zodiac and seven thriller shot without excessive use of cgi using less than half of the usual superhero budget and yet delivering the purest and most grounded version of the caped crusader one of its kind in today cg driven action blockbusters solidifying him as the world greatest detective1.0\tthis new batman movie is real masterpiece it is dark super realistic and honestly already one of the best batman ever also want to underline the very impressive performance of robert pattinson he clearly kill it what great actor have just discovered that the penguin was colin farrell haven seen it coming amazing1.0\tthis movie has raised the bar not only of superhero movies but all films in general have definitive movie experiences that raised my expectations of storytelling which won allow me to watch subpar stories anymore and the batman raised the bar once again modern films and miniseries that improved film and television quality for the audience that have resonated with me since 2012 are as follows arrival bo burnham inside true detective season portrait of lady on fire mission impossible fallout ex machina whiplash steve jobs manchester by the sea spider man into the spider verse marriage story 12 years slave scenes from marriage hbo seven psychopaths 1917 the imitation game shame knives out the batman has raised the bar for me as film goer and appreciate the care the entire cast crew and matt reeves gave this movie thank you0.0\thad so many expectations for this one huge of pattinson and recognise his potential batman is my all time favourite movie but this movie just ruined it for me pattinson literally re purposed his edward cullen performance into the batman which was the most shocking part as know what he capable of in terms of acting and how much he hated twilight also love zoë kravitz and think she one of the most gorgeous women on the planet but her acting was just bad also everyone was talking about their chemistry and was sitting there cringing at every moment they were on screen together the cheesiest catwoman batman relationship ve seen didn grow attached to any of the characters in the movie they were just so uninteresting and flat but blame that on the awful script all ve done was literally watching batman coming out of the shadows and people whispering vengeance for hours straight nothing happened in those three hours real shame1.0\thave to say that love batman as kid and after watching batman vs superman was very worried about this solo batman film the last good batman films have been dark knight and dark knight rises but this film guys it was very good very decent film would have to put this film right below dark knight so this film is about year two batman what we mean by that is bruce wayne is still young batman and sometimes in this film you notices it with few key weapons missing from his gadgets and he finds it hard to dive also the vibes from this film feels like joker such as the tempo of this film this batman film is more dark serious very good character development loved that we get to see more of batman himself than bruce wayne batman does not hold his punches he is really beating the crap out of the bad guys in this film what love is we get to see more of his detective abilities which is what batman is known for such as when it comes to the riddler puzzles batman spends time to figure them out liked how gotham villain aka the riddler leaves puzzles around intended for batman to see them the thing is riddler likes the be smarter than anyone and he knows that batman may be the only person who is on his level or smarter than him for me this film was more down to detail which made me like this film even more first the actors in this film robert pattinson does such an very good job at bring out the dark violent side of batman this films like also very angry batman like how he was at the end of the batman arkham city game batman is still trying to find his mark and his limits robert does very good job at being batman for sure paul dano as the riddler he was amazing he did good job and was perfect the actual from my eyes bring the riddler character alive and actual made him more of serious darker character from how he is from the classic batman tv show he was the perfect first villain for this first batman solo film for me zoë kravitz was and is my favourite catwomen she brings this character to live and does very good job we get to see the relationship or possible relationship between catwomen and batman like the chemistry between batman and catwomen colin farrell as oz aka penguin he does good job wanted to see more of him but he does good job love this guy jeffrey wright as an actor so was happy that he was chosen to play james gordon and he also does good job to bring this character to live have to say that love batman as kid and after watching batman vs superman was very worried about this solo batman film the last good batman films have been dark knight and dark knight rises but this film guys it was very good very decent film would have to put this film right below dark knight so this film is about year two batman what we mean by that is bruce wayne is still young batman and sometimes in this film you notices it with few key weapons missing from his gadgets and he finds it

as an actor so was happy that he was chosen to play james gordon and he also does good job to bring this character to live the action scenes were good the chase scene was good but would liked was the fight scenes we get to see more of darker batman than we have seen so look at this way this film is based on bruce wayne who is like in his second year being the batman he still feels angry of his parents loss and does not know when do stop beating down people also what we learn from this film is that bruce learns that he must try to also be or pretend to be bruce wayne for the public while he in the shadows continues to be himself the batman in previous films they have shown that bruce wayne is very good at pretending to be himself where as in this film he still can figure out that the two personalities are different people meaning he has to separate the two and not be the same when he is batman and bruce wayne would give this film stars ratings but out of 10 stars would give this film solid 10 stars very good film for sure like the style of this film as said it has joker style on this film1.0\tgreat batman graphic novel brought to life on the big screen robert is amazing and sold me the on the more recluse batman bruce supporting characters stole every scene especially penguin and catwomen the riddler genuinely left me scared at times the trilogy will truly be something special1.0\tbeautifully made felt the most respectful of the source material whilst being grounded gritty and exciting gives few twists making it more engaging than most films of this type1.0\tthis film was breath taking it was very dark but this noir theme fit because of the setting of gotham and batman during this time the cinematography of this film was in my opinion the best aspect of the film it truly enraptured the theme that matt reeves was going for robert pattinson paul dano colin farrell and jeffrey wright had the best performances in my opinion robert pattinson was perfect as batman and he looked so intimidating in the suit which for the noir theme of the film paul dano performance as the riddler was terrifying and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie he and robert pattinson helped make the film so realistic truly felt like was in gotham and in the middle of all this madness this film had true comic batman feeling to it batman was detective for the entirety of the film and damn good one if may add this is what was so entertaining about the film people want to compare this to the dark knight but they can not be compared because they are so different they are both great films in my opinion both films do certain things better than the other overall this is must see movie have already seen it twice and would love to see it again can not wait for the next film in the trilogy1.0\tnew journey and stories by bruce wayne batman to fight crime in gotham and confront ridler with his mysteries and adventure with distinctive performance by robott batesonon and fine action dose and very wonderful filming in various angles directing and soundtrack that added to the film and the beautiful injustice in gotham which reprobade the film for the length of the film and the tilt of the film because it is more an achievement than superhero1.0\tgreat to see the batman returning to the darkness and realism that christopher nolan made so great don watch this movie comparing it to nolan works just watch it for what it is new gotham everything about this movie was great from the cast to the story the action scenes everything pattinson was amazing as batman and hopefully this catapults him into the segment of actors where he should be the upper tier because he has deserved to be there for long time already can wait for the next installment1.0\tyikes this film went out punching from the get go can still hear the sound of the punches in my ears psychological thriller with noir and horror touches in gotham is mix of heaven the superhero batman gets new life with this tone that makes me so excited for more superhero films like this going into it was already intriuged by the cast of pattinson kravitz serkis dano and wright pattinson smashed it which wasn entirerly shocked by emo bruce definitely works within this gothic world and it made him more vulnerable and intriguing kravitz killed it as cat woman and hope she returns to perhaps bring something new to their dynamic wasn sure about serkis as alfred at first truly love him as an actor but thought he be too cool which was wrong about wright was fantastic but the amount of grunty whispering was bit ridiculous the cool guy voice felt bit overdone the rest of the cast were amazing and completely disappeared behind their roles especially farrell the cinematography was jaw dropping so many money shots that lost count the dirty dark tungsten lighting with fantastic angles and movement was so happy they didn shaky cam the action and just let the choreography shine which was the best ve seen to date greig frasier proves he the best dp working right now watching it at odeon luxe west end was great decision in terms of visuals but also sound man the punches and the vehicles made the cinema shake you feel the power and the impacts to degree ve never felt the massive and sometimes scary score made this an unforgettable soundscape loved the riddler take especially dano he was truly terrifying at times but ve gotten bit tired of all the livestream broadcast elements in films understand the message in here with social media danger and delusional radicalists but it become fairly trope all in all it difficult to weigh it up against nolan the dark knight they are completely different balls in different ballparks however imagine seeing heath ledger as the joker in this setting think more superheroes should grow up from their boyhood phase because batman succeeds with this more stuff like this please0.0\twhat happened to batman sense of humor and all the new gadgets he uses he was so emotional so serious and soooo boring it was worst of all batman movies the batman the bat mobil the puzzles the cat women the penguin even musics was like coming from lotr0.0\tpaid for batman movie and got to watch some depressed emo guy decide he doesn really want to be an incel after all purge himself of his white toxicity and save an acceptably diverse group of children wanted to vomit but fell asleep before it happened1.0\tthis is by far the best adaptation of the capade crusader matt reeves did an excellent job and robert pattinson was destined to play this iconic character happy to have witnessed this masterpiece1.0\twere should start the movie exceeded all my expectations love the details the opening the ending everything was perfect robert paterson was so cool how can he be this much great the movie end was so sad that leave the theater it been hours as hour the time passed too fast really enjoy every single second in this movie1.0\thave seen all the batman movies which came after 2000 and admit this is one of the best batman movies the movie was very long but not at all boring the cinematography the suspense and everything if this movie was so good enjoyed watching this movie1.0\twow ve watched the batman twice now all can say is wow every character had purpose every actor played there part well especially pattison and dano ultimately think this film is my favourite batman film and think on par with tdk all am wondering now is the next sequel villain will be this story can go many different ways this first instalment lived up to the hype full of many surprises and shocks really well written film by brilliant director fantastic film 101.0\trobert pattinson batman thought that as well the film starts off as gruelling mystery to which would unveil the plot of the film however the film for me just lacked that substance what substance you asked gore when are they going to make these films 18 and realistic ruthless criminals doing acts out of focus through the lens with film this long engagement needs to be high and to do this it needed more gruesomeness and more graphic violence on much lighter note the cinematography and dialogue was second to none1.0\tever since the trailer first rolled have waited ever since the first talks and rumors have waited and after that wait long wait we have been gifted and our wishes been answered we was given hour long of delightful well acted and greatly produced film never once did think of looking at the clock never once wondered how long until the credits rolled it was an entertaining ride the whole way the main villain riddler was very well portrayed and looking very forward to seeing him again making him similar and taking inspiration from the zodiac killer was clever move and the costume design was while not comic accurate fine fit for the movie and character personally view it more as his first suit and as his crime spree kept going his flamboyant behavior increased next want to touch on the costume design magnificent just so good the bat suit was made to fit reality and looked the part also thought they made huge improvements from the previous nolan movies in which the suit seemed almost too plastic and latex it seemed to stand to much out and felt sometimes cartoonish but with pattinson suit they used materials in which we would see real vigilante use leather kevlar and fabrics the world they built in this film gave the right gotham feeling and not the typical new york type beat feel like in the nolan movies and also wasn over the top gothic like in the burton movies and liked the inclusion of places like the iceberg lounge as said felt the characters was greatly performed and robert pattinson did an amazing portraying damaged and towering batman the writers was smart enough to understand that batman presence is more telling then loud words so many things have come to together to create this amazing flick and would highly recommend any person to view it in the cinema the acting sound design directing casting and cinematography was all great worth while watch for anybody1.0\tnot really batman or dc fan but after seeing the trailer and knowing robert pattinson was cast as batman had to go see it it is gorgeous film visuals and cinematography are amazing the fight scenes are also very well choreographed and just plain badass pattinson kravitz and dano all fit their respective roles very well they all gave great performances liked the element of mystery with the riddler leaving riddles in his path and also the main motif of political corruption what didn like lot of people have been saying this and have to say agree don think the movie needed to be hours they could ve gotten everything done in less time maybe hours and there was just one slight thing throwing it off maybe it was the cutting that made the pacing seem off not sure but if these had been improved it would ve gotten 10 rating1.0\tit was so much fun my theater was packed went to see it and was happy with the results do not expect too much action there are only like batman fight scenes it detective story basically cop movie but the cop is batman like se7en1.0\tperfect in every way acting direction story soundtrack action just perfect robert did an amazing job had hope in him after watching is other great movies like the lighthouse and good times1.0\twatched the batman in 4dx this was my first time watching batman film in the theatre and the first time experiencing 4dx it was the most incredible batman film ve watched matt reeves and his team did wonderful job in every aspect of the film his approach to batman is very fresh and unique he also wrote the screenplay for the movie with peter craig didn know that the bruce wayne in this film deals with his past trauma in different way than the other iterations he is filled with pure vengeance the casting is just perfect robert pattinson kills it as batman zoe kravitz delivers stunning perfomance as catwoman the best catwoman in my opinion colin ferrel is unrecognizable as the penguin he made the car chase sequence so much better with his perfomance and paul dano just scrared the crap out of me jeffrey wright gordan is much more involved in the story the things that genuinly love about the film other than the casting choices is its beautiful cinematography and mind blowing sound design greig fraser just nailed each and every shot felt so much immersed in the film paticulalrly the action sequences it was refreshing to see superhero film that didn look so bad michael giacchino score for the batman is suprisingly very hopeful just wished his music was used liitle more carefully as it felt repetitive for some reason there have been many batman films maybe because it is one the best comic book charater ever written but anyone who loves batman or just loves good films should watch this film0.0\tevery minute is redundant do not waste your time watching this crap this is no batman this is some other character in batsuit how come they spent more than 180 million to this project it is unbelieavable1.0\tno offence it the best batman movie ever storytelling cinematography and obviously the soundtrack was epic so obsessed with some scene and have to say that robert pattinson nailed it true masterpiece1.0\tthe batman is not masterpiece of film but it sure is masterpiece batman film the dark gritty atmosphere of gotham is certainly one of the best live action portrayals ve seen so far the film mystery keep you on the edge of your seat until the reveals the reveals were not as shocking as thought but the film makes up for it by its brutal combat amazing monologues and great acting robert is definitely one my favorite batman and the batman is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time1.0\tfirstly im not huge batman fan or fan for the movie adaptations of the dc universe except for zak snyder justice league but do love movies and cinema really enjoyed christopher nolan dark knight trilogy they are good enjoyable movies and ive enjoyed all of nolan work didnt bother with the trailer or reviews for this title as didnt think you could top what nolan had done man was wrong for me this is perfect film the pace of the film was so fluid it never felt like hours was glued to the screen adored the gothic setting it is supposed to be gotham after all it was dark and gritty and an emotional rollercoaster really felt for some of the scenario something that now feel lacked in the dark knight trilogy it was emotionally charged at times in really good way pattinson was awesome cant wait to see his character grow and develop also liked the fact that the batman was little less advanced tech and more high tech which kept it bit more realistic and not everything went his way and made me feel he is just regular guy under the mask trying to do the right thing the sound was punchy and the soundtrack was spot on the cinematography was outstanding the way reeve worked with the light and the dark even some of the camera angles are amazing few times had goosebumps that happens rarely these days once the movie finished it took me few hours to absorb what had just witnessed it was immense cant say many fims have had that much of an effect on me highly reccomend seeing this movie even if your not fan of superheroe movies this one hit very different in all the right places kudos matt reeves cannot wait to see what happens next1.0\tgotham city has never been so dark oppressive and scary city where everyone is part of the problem city that hardly knows hope in this city dark knight makes the decision in well choreographed action and breathtaking chase to fight crime that batman himself has problem with height and can not really fly find inappropriate also the big showdown leaves you bit underwhelmed at the end the film greatest strengths however are the great score the aesthetic camera work and robert pattinson these convey the feeling of broken hero who dedicates his entire life to the goal of bringing about even the slightest good in criminal and morally depraved city just perfectly1.0\tthe batman this is fantastic contribution to the superhero genre and must see for batman fans this film does wonderful job of conveying the batman world with the necessary grit and mood as well as excellent lighting and cinematography with some subtle connections within the tale and at the end this did wonderful job of implying numerous potential spinoffs the fight scene was also fantastic and well executed think this did not need to be three hours long and some scenes might have been cut better this movie should have been under two and half hours apart from this this was wonderful experience please do watch and enjoy1.0\tall keep saying that this movie made more sense than batman begins because batman is slowly learning everything and all insinuate bale batman became batman overnight are you joking he spent seven years traveling the world learning martial arts and then spent long time with the league of shadows batman became elite over seven years so when he went back to gotham he could already be all out of bubble gum not to mention he was beginning his sleuthing akoqling wearing balaclava etc this is where he learned to navigate the urban terrain and add it to his league of shadows toolbox you see now what mean it took bale longer to become batman but all the nubs in here think it fast1.0\trobert has full potential to be the best batman can wait to see how his character will evolve in future there is alot of potential in his batman the whole cast is just fantastic this one is more of detective batman trying to solve the crime but the riddler is always ahead of batman this movie is about batman realizing that he has given hope to gotham city then winning over the riddler1.0\tdefinitely no dark night but overall good movie pattinson was good batman but weird bruce wayne wasn feeling the twilight pale bruce we always see bruce as playboy billionaire hopefully the sequel will be even better0.0\tfor all those that say this movie is masterpiece and rate it and have to say only one thing in the same time duration was the the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring and this movie is actually masterpiece that people rewatch stil now more than 20 years later the batman was wasted hours of my life that will never rewatch it could easily be hour movie and this would make it more dence and enjoying experience batman is in my heart and deserves more0.0\twatching pattinson as batman is like watching paint dry emotionless robot honestly could be one of the worst movies ve ever seen really don understand the rave pattinson doesn laugh cry smile frown or joke the entire movie1.0\tvery dark version of the batman movies its not your usual batman world where the good and evil are comically portrayed and divided by clear lines in this version everyone has his secrets his demons the world is realistically cruel greedy and merciless as nolan saga set the benchmark for comparing any new work on this franchise in that respect loved this version the most never thought anything can outperform the nolan saga however this take on batman humbles nolan take as the rock of reality shatters glassy shiny world gave it 10 10 for story directing cinematography cinematography cinematography1.0\tthe good parts loved the cinematography colours used and many of the scenes especially the action sequences felt like the dark batman comics are none of prior batman movies even though more exciting are closer to comics than this one the story line is pretty good and overall it felt like an art movie the not so good part and the reason gave it star it was bit too long and actually slept for few minutes during long monologues while the overall story is engaging it lost the pace every now and then penguin was not well portrayed it didn feel like the super villian he is in the comics1.0\tgreat story perfect cinematography this is hours that flies by like was fan of the christioher nolan films as well this is different take it is film noire detective style with more human but cold approach1.0\tmatt reeves is the only director who managed to make movie with the essence of comic books dirty gothic corrupt and unequal gotham city complex story that holds the viewer from beginning to end this movie is the only superhero movie that is better than nolan dark knight in the same way that christopher river was immortalized as superman robert pattison will be immortalized as the batman with his batman1.0\thighly recommend so good and yes it is nearly hours but well worth it and the score the acting just incredible really really cant wait for sequel0.0\talmost fell asleep in the movie theatre the movie was long and boring sometimes had this feeling it was starting to get better and then again disappointment hoped for better1.0\tfar from being fan of superheroes movies but the batman has been big surprise for and my friends visually it 20 10 daring and assumed artistic choices arri lf lenses wide open are looking amazing the color choice the fact that it raining most of the scenes the camera angle there unique shots unique choices which make it stand out in crowd of movies where there way too much cg the city of gotham looks so unique and realistic and yet out of this world the action scenes were very immersive and the story was so much more interesting compared to previous batman movies finally being into technolgy could totally relate to the props used as the batman hi tech accessories they looked dozen times more realistic and coherent with the city it what wanted to see without knowing it can wait to see what comes next so memorable that keep thinking about it had to post review1.0\tvery good the cinema nails you hours without interval but you don get bored for minute at times it is pure and hard action and at others it becomes police officer with detectives looking for criminals the director gave his own version of the story because the gothic city is really gothic you don want to step on it every day it seems that the day is gray also the version of batman that pattinson gives is the best of the batmans that saw he is not the typical masculine and rude man but more real and suffered skinny than in the moments that he is bruce wayne you say this surely listens to nirvana liked that the story starts with an experienced batman and you don have to see his formation because otherwise it would be boring the soundtrack was also very good it made me want to listen to grunge when left the cinema1.0\tpattison embodied the early batman such as in year one the animated movie and novel series the hyper focus of his detective work and dissing catwoman as he almost uses her as tool rather than person which she calls him on allowing batman to not be like superman but shows his flaws as he tries to understand the overall conspiracy and multiple times is put in positions that could take his life great story line intense action thrown in freaking awesome car chase that you must watch in imax all the actors were top notch riddler paul dano was way freaking creepy and you see how deranged he can be at the end colin farrell kills it as the penguin and adds some levity selina kyle zoe kravitz as an adversary partner and part time love interest the whole movie just clicked and you didn feel like you were in hour movie seeing again friday in 4xd there is so much missed because there is so much to take in also no end credit scenes this isn marvel more than half the theater was staying during the credits rolling then finding out there are no end credit scenes1.0\tthink this movie belongs in conversation with nolan trilogy too dark but on the good the side enjoyed every single moment of it as matter of fact might go see it again provided that never saw movie twice in the cinema let alone in two consecutive days really excited about the new potential characters build up1.0\tthis might just be the best interpretation of both batman and gotham city that ve seen on the big screen the characters are so well written and the cast does an amazing job on portraying these characters the score is just beautiful michael giacchino proves that he is master of his craft just so excited to see what matt reeves has next for this universe0.0\tplease rate honestly guys batman fans too but this movie really something makes me slept twice in theater saw parent bring they childern wearing batman tshirt so happy entering theater they got batman trap1.0\twithin the first 10 min knew this was going to be an absolute banger matt reeves knew exactly what he was doing he knew exactly how to make another superhero movie honestly marvel could never pull something like this off at their current state pattinson was perfect and loved the young inexperienced batman his monologue diary did so much for me when he said he doesn know if being the batman was actually helping it really just made him so relatable batman is usually cocky rich prick but this bruce has never been so human his relationship with alfred is beautiful going from your not my dad to ok yea you are my dad was beautiful that being said he had so many amazing moments with every character and it really felt like every character had their moments jeffrey wright is an absolute king and killed it as gordon like this guy knows how to act and delivers every line with perfect timing my jaw was just on the floor every time they were interacting zoe kravitz perfect casting and she knew the assignment every scene farrell was hilarious and unrecognizable just masterful performance john turturro also gave an amazing performance and tbh the entire cast was perfect the only one who fell flat at moments was paul dano as the riddler idk what it was think they were just reaching for ledger like performance the sound cinematography everything truly came together masterfully it somehow felt like noir western detective super hero movie batman was damn cowboy stepping out of the shadows with his boots and just striking fear into everyone my god what movie idk how they pulled it off1.0\tpls don hype up this movie more than it is it solid movie the best dc recently dc should go with the dark and brutal theme like this and not the funny teen marvel style the cast are very good except the unessecary black mayor her acting is poor and emotionless maybe too young for the role this movie doesn follow any other batman style before it detective movie with some actions mixed in not too much if you just go watch the movie and don expect anything then you will have very good time1.0\twith the recent success of the batman the distinction between dc and marvel films is very clear marvel given standard template and run with it it like your watching the same movie formula just different title and actors with dc each take is an artistic vision of its own from nolan snyder tod philips and now reeves marvel may have commercial success don really care about critics who can be corrupted but the breadth and depth of dc films is quite impressive unfortunately dc has given in to the marvel formula with some of their upcoming light and fun take of their characters black adam the flash etc so we ll basically see more of the same1.0\teverything is just good and perfect rewatchable movie for me but the only problem in this movie got is it action after action effect litrally batman punches guy at least 10 but the face of guy is just get only red because of it pg 13 rating guess1.0\twhere other batman films have been occupied with understanding the man behind the mask this new take from matt reeves focuses on the batman persona bruce wayne has lost himself in when gotham is gripped by brutal the brutal murders if the riddler batman must figure out not just psychotic clues the line separating him from the riddler this gritty take riffs off of the gangster genre to create visually stunning film that feels just like batman comic1.0\tabsolutely must see in my opinión the best batman movie fascinante la mejor película de batman hasta la fecha una increíble película de detectives1.0\tthank you for this pattinson slayd it as the batman awsome good chemistry bethween catwoman and the batman this is not good movie it fantastic thx0.0\tbatman is boring and the casting looks like they were signed for teen titans there are multiple things wrong with this batman it hours of garbage1.0\tthis is three hour film but could have sat for another two and enjoyed good use of the characters and different take spin to the previous batman films if you are batman fan you will enjoy this go watch it1.0\tabsolutely loved this movie could recognize themes early on in the movie and understood why the antagonist was doing the things he was nothing in this movie happened without reason that ties into the overall movie motion and themes but it did slow down bit because of this don think any scenes should have been removed but some definitely took their time one flaw kept seeing that bothered me was how similar they made certain characters to characters from other movies like se7en or zodiac which was great if those movie never existed loved what riddler was doing but it been done before very similarly and acted out very similarly as well the action was incredible and captivating cinematically every shot was so well done and clean there was lots of symbolism in the movie throughout and believe every character was well put together overall loved the batman and will always highly suggest it to anyone1.0\tthis is fantastic movie as good as any of the christopher nolan trilogy pattinson is fantastic batman physically the best representation due to his tall physical stature the reboot of penguin riddler and catwoman are done immaculately got the feeling of reading the comics from the 1970s whist watching this especially when the souped up batmobile hit the road well done to the cast and matt reeves looking forward to seeing the return of the joker cut above marvel would advise all superhero fans to go see it now1.0\thave been hyping myself up like crazy for this movie which is never good idea because if it doesn meet your expectations you ll leave the cinema disappointed which admittedly was what initially felt had expected crazy psycho thriller like zodiac or se7en which don get me wrong is what you do get in this movie but it not what made this movie fantastic in my opinion what made the movie great batman the whole movie feels like its batman pov we get see him struggle with his motivations see him solve mystery that is always one step away from being solved and we see him question whether he really making difference robert also did great job from the moment saw tenet knew he be perfect for the role even if this movie isn dark knight or batman begins it still is wonderful start for what now is my favorite version of batman can wait to see more of batinnson the riddler had watched prisoners again before the movie so thought was prepared for what paul dano was going to bring to the screen but the way he made riddler feel crazy and clearly calculated was phenomenal the riddler always felt like the aquaman in the sense that he wasn taken seriously he was the villain that always was seen as joke and was never portrayed well in my opinion but this time around the riddler is serious force to be reckoned with even managing to outsmart batman catwoman zoe kravitz has the best storyline in the movie probably there are so many revelations surrounding her and it makes watching her on screen really enjoyable thought that this version of catwoman would be boring as expected the movie to focus to much on batman yet this movie really takes it time with the character it doesn rush anything and gives us time to understand the goals and motivations of catwoman thoroughly enjoyed her and hope we get to see more in future movies shows the hour length while the run time may seem daunting at first it really isn felt at all besides maybe couple scenes in the 3rd act there always something that happening and the movie keeps you engaged almost always the inclusion of all the riddles was such smart move because everybody in the theater was trying to solve them some people knew like the one mentioned in the trailer but the rest were actually very good they weren hard enough to make me think it was impossible but not easy enough to make me roll my eyes it reminded me lot of the scene between bilbo and gollum in hobbit an unexpected journey in that scene gollum and bilbo give each other riddles to solve as viewer it was fun to see if you can figure it out the story is also fantastic props to matt reeves for doing such phenomenal job creating such an entertaining mystery thriller the cinematography oscar nominated soon to be oscar winner hopefully greg fraiser has done it again thought he was going to peak with dune but the camera work here was brilliant beautiful stunning breath taking and so much more would ve stayed in the cinema for more hours just to see all the beautiful shots he could create can very realistically see get another nomination if not win for the incredible job he done here every conversation every fight scene every shot felt so much better than could have hoped what stopped the movie from being perfect the ending don get me wrong the ending is great but considering had massive expectations for something explosive like se7en felt let down the movie does have good ending as said but nothing earth shattering nothing super personal would the movie have been better with something more extreme maybe but then it would have maybe made the sequels worse the action while it is well shot and well choreographed it really does not compare to marvel movies or any action movie for that matter expected the action to be faster more engaging and not less bland the one great fight scene which was rather shot was towards the end when the batman fights of individuals with some really impressive fast explosive fighting overall ok with it being more grounded and slow paced action still wish it could ve been better but it might have made the movie what it is the batman is the most comic book accurate portrayal of the masked vigilante we have gotten to date even if it isn your favorite batman movie it has to be agreed that lot can be done with this batman cannot wait for any shows movies that will follow this story thank you matt reeves for creating such great movie1.0\tfinally movie that delivers on who batman truly is in the comics every single character was perfectly cast and delivered an amazing comic rendition of the characters of course there are elements unique to the movie but they just make the movie that much more grittier best superhero movie ever1.0\tve been looking forward to goth batman since it was first announced and it did not disappoint pattinson portrayal of batman breathed life into neglected franchise and comic hero albeit by taking to the darkest place yet appreciated that his portrayal wasn hulking unrealistically sized behemoth who does good when called to he vulnerable and real and has lived through some real trauma every character in this film feels like they belong and have purpose and the casting was incredibly well done paul dano as the riddler was next level of unhinged the only scene that felt unneeded was the clearly forced set up for sequel in the final scene in arkham hospital it felt contrived and disgenuine and brought the film down bit doubt anyone will win awards for their performances in the batman but they absolutely deserve them if it wasn quite so long would go see it second time just to support the project because it really is an outstanding film1.0\tbig big banger of movie felt like the three hours passed by in and every plot point transformed smoothly in the next the cinematography was stunning and every characters was really well developed over the span of the film1.0\tawesome movie the cinematography was beautiful easily the most beautiful superhero movie ever the movie was quite interesting the story line was awesome and the seeing the movie in imax the background score was just next level you can feel the music in in imax the movie maybe be too dark for some people but loved because batman is supposed to be dark the only complain have is that the pg 13 ruined the movie batman punches person like 100 times but the person face has almost no scratches other than that the movie is beautiful and must see in theaters1.0\tit is good batman movie but not at the level of the dark knight trilogy this one focusses more on the detective side of the batman visuals look awesome story is also good would suggest you watch the kashmir files instead if you re going to theatre this movie you can watch online but the kashmir files is once in lifetime experience that is based on kashmiri pandit holocaust1.0\tatmosphere of the movie was absolutely amazing the batman was pretty dark just what we want from batman movie just go watch it you won be disappointed btw robert pattinson nailed it and did very good job as batman1.0\tthis is real batman movie like christopher nolan not ben affleck type why you need more 150 char dont know what to type 150 char is very long for me am trying1.0\twowza hands down the best batman love the way they used younger batman pattinson rocks some actors who take on big roles don lose their old characters that made them successful could not see diggery nor cullen robert pattinson has come into his own great casting and zoe kravitz is fabulous1.0\tmatt reeves paul dano fan so was curious about another re boot it better than any affleck involvement why zoe kravitz as catwoman totally miscast dull choice understand her disappointment because of nolan too urban slur every scene with her is mesmerizingly monotonous there no chemistry whatsoever she extremely tiny short with heels the dialogue audio is so low like on another wavelength along with the actors using soft actor tone dano choice of just screaming his lines made me eye roll laugh so annoying lacking suspense watched it twice still can recall any memorable scenes except my favorite nirvana tune that car chase was derivative unnecessary it looked expensive the poor choice of wheel well camera angles sucked we weren drawn nor immersed in the scene we couldn even see the car action just wheel angle shots driver shots might as well use cgi like lame fast furious with no origin plot why the hour length no humor no wit indecipherable dialogue audio no artful acting no fun dreading the sequel with more lifeless zoe1.0\tthis may be somewhat stretch but truly believe this is the best batman film to ever be released probably one of the best things to ever come out of dc yes it better than the dark knight yes it better than 1989 batman and what makes this film so fantastic it knew what it was doing every character that we re supposed to care about is given the perfect amount of screen time and development the movie feels refreshing it feels nice to finally get something we care about from dc after long string of mediocre to straight up bad movies the suicide squad peacemaker not included pattinson gave an impressive performance ll admit my expectations were low once he was announced to play the caped crusader but he surpassed those expectations and gave performance of lifetime zoë kravitz was another outstanding performance in this incredible film she easily gave the best catwoman performance out of all of them her and pattinson chemistry was match made in heaven finally seeing other villains that aren the joker make an onscreen appearance was very refreshing don get me wrong the joker is fantastic villain but it nice to see some of batman other great villains get moment in the spotlight paul dano crazed performance as the riddler was unbelievable and think it truly rivals ledger joker performance as the best onscreen villain performance the film does feel little slow at the beginning but other than that this film is damn near perfect it everything could ever want from batman film and the it just works so well 101.0\tit was amazing dark breathtaking gorgeous shots weird and disgusting riddler batman in his beginning shows great character before he develops into the advanced version he will become years later hope they continue1.0\tfirst of all this movie approaches the batman in different way so no need to compare it with dark knight trilogy pattinson is doing great job its performance is not facinating but it gives am batman vibe positives musics are good but repetetive riddler cinematography batman negatives catwoman story was so basic in somescenes some characters talk so much acceptable logical mistakes in superheromovies1.0\tthe batman it awesome this film is definitely darker version of batman but above all it is story of batman answering clues and riddles this is something didn know wanted from batman until saw this film highly enjoy films like zodiac and the dark knight so was glad to see that was the direction they took this movie the combat in this film is far superior to any incarnation of the caped crusader when batman fights you can actually see the great fight choreography they created unlike the nolan trilogy this is the best batman batman in this movie is focused on more than the villains that might sound like given but normally in batman movies it the villains that get the spotlight and batman is secondary this is not true of this movie batman is front and center and they focus on giving him satisfying arc the batmobile was awesome but the actual car chase was anti climactic after the trailers would say that for the most part the riddler is an alright villain he ain no joker the only problem have with the riddler is that he pops in and out as he pleases and isn consistently present for every major conflict this was frustration had with the movie as whole it has so many elements and plot beats that it tends to forget about certain elements and then reintroduce them and then forget about them again it has very little consistency even batman character arc felt like they set it up and then rushed to pay it off toward the end cause there were too many other things they had to do the entire third act of this movie takes place after they resolve half of their plot lines which makes it feel tacked on and empty this also confuses the riddler motivations because his goals have already been completed and then they trick you and say oof the riddler had one more trick up his sleeve that just doesn make sense to me and the final battle was far too short for me this is why loved batman so much he had the consistency that the other characters didn the movie can forget it protagonist time for me to rank the performances rob pattinson jeff wright paul dano zoë kravitz john turturro colin farrel overall great new batman excited to see the franchise for him1.0\trobert pattinson is remarkable actor dark and trying to prove himself is too good the bat and the cat chemistry is very nice paul dano riddler done some amazing work pattinson batman gonna be too much fun1.0\tthe most accurate depiction of the character you ll ever see at least for now yes nolan tdk was masterpiece but was bale portrayal as the batman the best we have ever seen hate the comparison game but robert pattinson as batman is the best live action batman have ever seen still love you batfleck but battinson nailed it collin stole the show as the penguin selina motives to fight alongside bruce made kravitz catwoman so intriguing dano riddler was terrifying and jeffry as gordon brings something new to the table this isn your typical comic book movie but rather drama thriller kinda flick that keeps you intensified and on the edge of the seat if you re in to that genre what you need to keep in mind is that this is still batman second year of being the batman he still learning quite naive and taking punches in the face and shots in the chest can wait for the sequel love it1.0\tthis is exactly what the batman is supposed to be it perfect acting is great action scenes are great villains are different but great matt reeves killed it1.0\tthis movie perfectly encapsulates the batman character he feels just like comic book batman if were to explain this movie to friend would say it is slow paced thriller starring batman being detective that may not be for everyone but for me that is what needed from batman film it feels fresh the cinematography is just top notch and so was the acting the third act is what is stopping me from giving this movie 10 10 definitely would be excited for sequel1.0\tfeel that the rhythm is little slow but it will be interesting to get into the state slowly later there are some pictures that think are quite good batman in the night the embodiment of justice1.0\tlet start that it 100 my opinion as mainly marvel fan but watching dc movies too when saw new batman movie coming out again with another actor already new something is going wrong yesterday went to the movie and after one hour of watching understood that it full of drama and long shots the action ok but not what expected after the joker the special effects haven seen anything special plus felt like batman is slow the actors why the hell there is actors from marvel in dc movies no good actors out there why albert is younger then expected and he is more german then he is british what can add for the end the movie was good but could be match match better1.0\tthe iconoclast dark brooding gripping and complex simply forget how you perceive the batman genre if you re out for fun night out with big tub of butter popcorn then just drop the idea enter the dark and twisted world of matt reeves batman here is lost soul still traumatic and full of angst for the tragic loss of his parents he feels more human than superhero burdened with his self righteousness and the legacy of being born in politically powerful multi billionaire family enters villain we have not seen anywhere in comic caper riddler batman arch nemesis is also his mirror image in so many ways also vigilante but devoid of any empathy he is more like sadistic serial killer brilliantly played by paul dano brilliantly supported by catwoman zoe kravitz gothic tragic romantic plot penguin an unrecognisable collin farell and others the definitive neo noir go watch it1.0\tdon get me wrong ve loved the dark knight for long long time and still do to this day but after seeing this movie it was like someone took the comics and put it on the screen the batman was perfect representation of everything believe makes batman movie the action the cinematography and most of all the story this story is presented in mystery detective story that we have arguably not seen before and it done so well every actor played their role phenomenally especially robert pattison you played young bruce exactly the way imagined loved this movie and think that it is genius reimagining of the batman world1.0\tits all in the title really enjoyed batman movie batman was 90 and bruce was like 10 of the movie enjoyed the detective aspect of the movie and that side we have never seen of cameras before the cinematography is great the movie has great lighting even on dark scenes and not forgetting great performance from the actors robert pattinson is great as the batman1.0\trobert pattinson is great love the gritty feel and interesting take on the villains zoe kravitz is amazing too real pleasant surprise can wait for the next installation of the franchise1.0\tif david fincher did batman it would be like this dark gritty constantly raining mix of seven and zodiac basically serial killer thriller but why complain when it done to perfection it gives the dark knight fresh unique look this is batman going back to his roots and being detective like in the comics it like modern version of classic 1940 detective stories with twisted violent touch added the length is absurdly long but it never leaves you looking at the clock and the length is justified by the plot entertaining dark twisted but never feels to long1.0\ttempered my expectations going into this movie christian bale is top five actor of this generation and the previous trilogy had everything going for it was blown away the first half of this movie all the way up until the car crash scene with penguin was near perfect sequence the score something in the way was inserted perfectly into this film robert pattinson has fresh take on batman that truly appreciate in generation that lacks originality entirely the riddler was an awesome villain the comparisons to todays day and age with anonymous are very very intriguing to me can wait to see how the sequel plays out because matt reeves left the door wide open for the next storyline in this production 101.0\twent in expecting phenomenal piece of art that would challenge the dark knight left disappointed the film is clearly overhyped it was good film don get me wrong but because of the hype it has surrounding it it makes people forget what real phenomenal piece of work is it was good story line very slow paced good acting but overall not even close to as good as movie like the dark night0.0\tactually walked out from the movie very boring and depressing lot of cringy moments even though pattinson is quite good actor this movie is directed in sad way and couldnt even enjoy with actors like farrel or pattinson himself after the first one hour already knew wouldnt last till the end have never walked out from the movie before so guess you can understand the disappointment1.0\tamazing pacing and cinematography better than the dark night but the heath ledgers joker will never be topped robert patinsons batman is the greatest character development have seen for superhero and colin farrell is seriously underrated in this movie1.0\tmaybe bit overrated but the characterization of batman and bruce wayne is brilliant the cinematography and lighting are gorgeous and the plot manages to make hours feel like one and half it worth watching you won regret it1.0\tit was absolutely phenomenal not only an amazing batman film but also an amazing film seriously think it could be an oscar contender for best film1.0\tthe thing that always put batman apart from other superheroes is one well maybe two distinct things he not really super and he not really hero the term anti hero is too far off but you get my point he no wide eyed peace loving team player and he was never supposed to be dcu hasn gotten that but the batman nailed it while other movies mostly focus on the bat himself his struggles and self doubt his mental state and isolation this movie definitely play into these points but it gotham the city that gotten the main focus the city has personality pulse sure other movies have made it dark but they haven made it noir and gothic while the gotham we see here is all about that we see head on the nitty gritty corruption the mysticism and the depraved people that populate the rooms and streets of gotham violent gangs murderers corrupt politicians living out very alive mob culture and looming above them all dark knight completely in sync with the city that shaped him balancing on thin line between sanity and the much easier path of passive acceptance pattison batman is younger man than we re used to but it makes his actions much more believable and his insecurities easier to see and buy into kravitz selina kyle has more personality and more proper agenda than any catwoman before her without losing the traits of sexy and seductive cat burglar who knew woman could be all these things shocking wright gordon is as uncorrupted as we always knew him to be and he is perfect counter part to the looming bat without over playing the naïvity of good hearted person or making him an imbecile serkis would ve never been on my list of potential alfred but here we are and he doing his part without fault the character has been toned down maybe because we re not seeing much of young bruce wayne but he has the most prominent part to play as living moral compass to the young man he been raising this is the best batman we ve had since christian bale and nolan did their take and hope to see more of it gotham is alive and the bat is right at home1.0\tthe best batman movie for me so excited to see how this batman grows with time the cinematography was insane and story etc too can wait for catwoman penguin and gcpd shows which is future for this so called batverse let go guys1.0\tgreat action movie this movie little bit too long but overall really good and intresting movie to watch realistic acting and great story of the film best actors0.0\tthis movie was great idea but just not hitting the ideas first this movie is long plot doesn boost the story enough to make it feel shorter by the end you know it been going on too long batman just wasn there and catwoman wasn their either it rates between ben afleck and george clooney it far cry from christian bale1.0\tthe batman most beautiful most grounded batman ever music was epic colour palette was eye catchy after have so many movies on batman finally we see his detective side and mind game of bruce wayne robertpattinson killed it the constant conflict between riddler and batman cheer the entire movie practical effects realistic approach1.0\tseriously if you are fan of batman you know just how good this movie really is it the most comically accurate batman we ve ever seen and it still doesn give itself up as film to do so matt reeves knows the character so well and it evident in the fact that he took from so many different comics to mold this take on the caped crusader will not spoil anything in the movie but if you re batman fan it is must watch1.0\tlos años de espera valieron la pena de lo mejor del género de superhéroes la música es excelente la dirección de matt reeves es hermosa zoe kravitz como catwoman me sorprendió para bien colin farrell está irreconocible paul dano da miedo dando una actuación muy buena robert pattinson da la mejor actuación del personaje para mí demostrando que es un gran actor la fotografía del film es muy buena con planos que están para tenerlos en un póster en la pared de tu casa no abusa del cgi usando efectos prácticos la mayoría del tiempo era lo que esperaba más1.0\tfinally ve finished watching the batman it was one hell of experience to be honest this is the darkest batman adaptation so far the movie is beautifully filmed with the amazing writing and the actors were perfect in their characters especially robert pattinson as the batman the opening song something in the way was perfect with the whole batman theme hope we will get sequel1.0\tperhaps it the recent trend of superhero movies getting reduced to essentially an aggregation of insta reels or tik toks filled with dopamine release moments that this grim depiction of corrupt gotham stands head and shoulders above the rest it reminds you of what can be achieved when shots allow actors to act and while matt reeves creates world of his own in this depiction to his immense credit the movie portrays gotham that is as close to the batman lore as possible while nolan trilogy is just brilliant spectacle of story telling and direction of the highest order you feel it nolan movie more than batman movie this however is batman movie and that some achievement mad props to reeves for this and staying with the trilogy for moment the comparisons are futile enjoy them both but ll say this of batman begins were to be standalone movie this probably tops that supported by the brilliant acting all around him pattinson portrays batman struggling with the persona of bruce that isn trying to get liked or trying to motivate you that you do by the end of the movie is another matter this portrayal will stick with you he reminding you again and again that being batman is damaging and that simply because the direction allows him to convey that with still shots so encompassing and engaging that you couldn miss the pain and frustration in his eyes even if you tried the movie assumes that you know and understand batman and therefore isn an origin story but it still is in way and am usually not this harsh but people not liking this don understand batman or cinematography or acting or direction basically they don get what cinema is about or they re just biased or misinformed the themes the symbolism the narration will indulge the cinephile in you even if you didn know you had one probably the biggest compliment could give is that this movie makes tdk trilogy feel commercial one suggestion do watch it in theatres and ones with top top sound ps this movie isn meant for kids they should stick with mcu1.0\tthe whole composure of the movie was perfect the plot line was straightforward with very minimal fluctuations and the lack of forced comedic moments added so much more depth and personality to the movie if dc plans on releasing more movies like this might become huge fan1.0\tthis movie has everything the cameras the sounds the really cool characters for me it one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once and of course robert is as awesome as everyone says the characterization is so much deeper than the other films we get to see multidimensional people with purpose even if the purpose to to kill and maim we care about what happens for change and we go along for the ride small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself also people do some pretty stupid things considering what threat this guy is these are little things and without them we wouldn have the huge finale1.0\tafter watching it twice on the cinema finally got to take in everything that the film has to offer and must say it glorious the cinematography is incredible the acting is fantastic the script is amazing and the score by michael giacchino is great the detective side that we hadn quite seen as fleshed out on other batman films makes it feel fresh the action feels pretty grounded on reality to the point it feels raw which is excellent the film might be bit too long but the final product makes it worthwhile it feels like combination of seven and the dark knight hope this franchise continues to expand this universe that isn connected to the rest of the dceu it seems to be the only way we will get this kind of director driven stories that have so much potential1.0\tmakakakakakakansnzjzkssksksk sorry but have to get back wyqwowowowi and then have to go to bed so can get shower and have shower so ll let you know if can do that for you or do you1.0\tloved it great story and well told the cinematography is amazing and is well worth the watch was sacred that it wouldn live up to the legacy of the dark night but it didn disappoint1.0\tthis movie is good and provides some solid entertainment the plot is intruiging up to point casting is great score fantastic and at times the movie swiftly and shortly dips into some sort of old school horror trops woth off note piano tangents striking during startling moments also find the acting to be overall of great quality task handled willingly and probably towards the directors vision it shortcomings lies in the plot which also like horror movie has you caught until the reveal of the horror or in this case the antagonist but after that the excitement dies down bit what you thought was the final act were in fact not so the movie drags on and you are wondering what else lies in the store and while it provides some action it seems bit anti climactic in the mid section the plot seems to come to sort of halt as the batman tries to figure out whats next in the end you re left feeling as it did not justify it long running time which could have better be spent introducing the new bruce batman and detail his backstory instead of having it served throughout the film if the running time really needed to be what it is thought it good foundation to launch new batman series on and it does leave you optimistic which is what makes this 10 and not 101.0\tjust came back from watching this film and ve gotta admit this is the best movie ve ever seen not saying it the greatest movie of all time just saying this based off my opinions see lot of saw jigsaw in this film which should say is my favorite horror movie of all time and lot of other different movies to this will definitely get nominated and hopefully win oscars for best cinematography best score and best supporting actor hopefully being the riddler speaking of the riddler he is probably the best thing in this movie paul dano absolutely nailed this role perfectly he and heath ledger are so good at their roles it terrifying must admit that ve never read the comics as not that much of big reader so have different view but in my closing remarks robert pattinson is dark knight0.0\tif you re facing difficulties fallen sleep this movie for you the rhythm pacing very poor roles characteristics not been written well best part in the movie is cameraman director of photography1.0\tit dark slow paced satisfying plot with stunning performance from every character every character has their part of hand in the plot no one left empty handed or just with few mins of screen presence rddler nailed the voice and captured the essence of riddler not in clothing but the methods of riddler you will come out singing something in the way for sure and music is so good it fits the theme brilliantly cinematography is chef kiss loved mando loved dune now the batman is no exception greig faser is legend most realistic batman film to date love to see how they make their next iterations lot of people compare it to the dark knight which is nt fair and doesn make sense as it is third film in trilogy and the batman is the first iteration of it disagree with the people whenever this comes up compare it to batman begins solid 10 10 would love to see matt reeves trilogy1.0\tthis is new hero movie not focusing on fighting not using power but will be detective line which is done well worth following however the film does not move quickly boring at first and leave too many issues that make the movie too long0.0\tthis is really bad poor acting weak casting and find the constant racial slurs disgraceful total flop and an embarrassment to dc the cinematography storyline and the feel of this was dreadful boring from start to finish couldn sit through this again worst batman to date0.0\tthe worst batman ve ever watched very little scenes and cheap decor there are no high tech gadgets as in the previous series and robert pattinson just isn for this movie batman needs to be more masculine more gentleman bad bad batman1.0\tokay so finally got chance to see this film and let me tell you it was absolutely everything it promised to be and more that not saying it perfect but it pretty close enough to it and loved the back story as well it fantastic in every single way the action is perfect too highly recommend it0.0\twhat more can say then several times wanted to leave the theater but had already paid for the ticket they tried to bring graphic novel to life they failed miserably the only redeeming part is the billionaire destruction derby batmobile1.0\tthis movie is superb and these star reviews are joke if didn like the idea of star wars for example wouldn go and watch it and then leave one star review acting is brilliant cinematography is brilliant score is brilliant if you re dc fan go and make your own mind up1.0\tit always difficult to say after single viewing that movie is masterpiece yet matt reeves the batman certainly fits the bill the film noir inspiration leads the film in direction not explored enough by previous batman filmmakers with dark colour scheme and outstanding production design reinforcing gotham as an eerily unsettling city robert pattinson is revelation as the dark knight and whilst his bruce wayne identity may not get huge share of screen time he highly compatible as both his villainous counterpart paul dano as the riddler is fantastic with terrifying voice and an excellent representation of well written interpretation of the riddler his endless riddles keep you engrossed throughout as batman works to solve the case every actor puts in fine performance michael giacchino score is ever present throughout with relentless theme sure to embed itself in your mind the cinematography is instantly impressive whether it be the rooftop shots or the upside down caped crusader comparisons to the dark knight are inevitable but the two are entirely different beasts nolan thriller is remarkable but of totally different atmosphere the batman has cemented reeves as worthy filmmaker for this installment and with plenty of promise for sequels fans are sure to be excited1.0\tthings that were fantastic robert pattinsons quiet but nevertheless expressive batman with his eyes and posture zoe catwoman agile and quick riddler and penguin amazingly portrayed the soundtrack the story it was actually interesting and has put you in the edge of your seat things that costs this movie the stars the unnecessary love story between batman and catwoman actually really didn see the sense of the romantic relationship or especially the kissing might as well have been flirty and teasing the lack of blood and little gore considering batman violent attitude and his young age movie was too long felt like was overstimulated and losing my concentration at times definitely need to watch this movie second time but this is my expression from the first watching and hope we will get more sequels1.0\tthe most anticipated blockbuster stupendous movie of this year undoubtedly strongly recommend all those people who haven yet watched this movie please visit your nearest theatre and watch it asap because this movie is worth watching it1.0\tit movie of dark knight it doest mean you should only be using black in every thing screen black bat suit black shot in black it square to cube of black0.0\tbased on the reviews you re most likely thinking you gotta see this film all the people giving poor reviews are bitter jaded purist angry movie goers nope this movie just stinks from top to bottom if you liked christopher nolan batman trilogy this is the antithesis of that in just about every way pros really liked the cinematography had dark gritty feel that gave gotham desperateness to it now for the cons the story is very very very very long winded crime drama think if batman was in svu lots of drama minimal action and it is wayyy too long each scene extends minutes longer than needed the way they tell the story too is done so poorly and becomes exhausting to follow but even if it was good story and it was told well and it didn feel like poorly written svu episode you don care because you re not invested in any of the characters not even batman if you re wondering what batman is like it is edward from twilight in bat suit literally the exact same quiet soft spoken mopey character which isn bad by the way just not exciting bruce wayne is bummer alfred is under utilized and there is cold barely relationship between him and bruce gordon catwoman penguin the riddler honestly you don care about any of them the riddler character is intriguing but isn bad exciting enough to really have that hatred towards him because he taking out the bad guys seriously are we the audience supposed to be staunch advocates for due process and the climax boy oh boy after hours this is what we ve all been waiting for batman can literally stand up because the water is so shallow but this is the big climactic moment wet sneakers also dialogue is poor laughable towards the end music is good but builds up to nothing action scenes are good but few and far between batmobile is pontiac gto with flame booster in the back and the whole damn thing should ve and could ve been wrapped up in hours not nearly you know when people write save your time and money and pass and you think they re jaded idiots okay well this isn one of those times this movie stinks please save your time and money and pass1.0\tthis movie is such refreshing and necessary change for the batman series seeing the world greatest detective solve the case of the riddler killings was masterfully crafted by matt reeves this movie completely immerses the viewer in an entirely new take on gotham which makes it seem like the most miserable and hopeless place imaginable robert pattinson was extremely impressive in his role and surpassed all expectations that had for him in this movie the cinematography is the best have ever seen in any superhero movie have ever seen along with the soundtrack which has been in my head ever since saw the film which was absolutely masterful by michael giacchino this was easily the best batman film to date and made hours feel like less than because of the thrilling action sequences and developing mystery and moody environment of gotham city can not wait for the sequel0.0\tdo not even bother waste your time watching this don know what is wrong with these directors of these iconic movies thought the new matrix was awful but this movie takes the absolute pack of biscuits can list any spoilers because there is nothing to spoil save your weekend and money and don bother waste your time batman catwoman penguin who ever casted these characters needs new day job 100.0\tworst bateman ever where is ben affleck where is christian bale omg no story movie can be done in 30 minutes maybe less if there is less rate could of rate1.0\tthe first batman movie where batman is really the main character has fantastic arc and really understands batman this movie is work of art and truly dream for every batman fan dano riddler is truly amazing and the 2nd best comic book movie villain after heath ledgers joker1.0\tmatt reeves showcases the most vulnerable side of the caped crusader while the film does come out with few flaws it is by far the most grounded detective tale brought on the big screen which is highly intact to its source materials story the film sheds light on the gotham city rather than the batman as central character unlike previous films in which bruce wayne has been the sole focus reeves takes an opposite direction to first give broader picture of gotham city and then narrows it down to bruce wayne although the batman backstory is highly missing we should expect it to be completing the central character arc in future sequels screenplay if you are driven by batman bruce wayne detective avatar then the screenplay of this film is treat while lot of scenes could have been crunched it is in the final moments we get to experience that reeves has set benchmark for all the crucial characters and now the film is full canon ready to pick each individual character and present film or tv series on the same to further mention jim gordon played by jeffery wright and penguin played by colin farrell are already signed up for tv series which will see the continuation of the characters from this film cinematography the cinematography remains highly intact with the film theme it should be appreciated that perfect casting of batman is also the reason film stands out to its predecessors especially paul dano as the riddler gives horror vibes in most of the scenes as the camera slowly pans across his victims it will surely send chills down your spine overall high octane detective drama which should be experienced in the theatres1.0\tmatt reeves has put the quintessential version of batman to the screen the cast is unbelievably stacked and all on their game the score is so generationally iconic surrender the oscar to michael giacchio immediately robert pattinson is powerhouse as still grieving bruce wayne figuring out how to be batman for the city he loves and the police precinct that doesn respect him yet he still building his legend and we re watching this character grow in this first step of hopeful trilogy in my opinion this was 10 times better than the dark knight and comic book films in general need to take note this is how you adapt batman it the film ve waited my entire life to see 10 10 more of this please1.0\tthis film has the potential to make every man be better morally and ethically as human being and that great message for movie to deliver this batman and bruce wayne touches you on an emotional level which nolan version did too but feel the magnitude of reach is far greater for this one undoubtedly the best batman movie ever pure unique yet still everything had hoped for and beyond matt reeves is genius pattinson is the best batman ever gonna go and watch it again in theaters once is not enough for this masterpiece1.0\tsynopsis when serial killer the riddler terrorises gotham there is only one person who can stop him the batman robert pattinson will he be able to unravel the mystery behind gotham darkest secrets or will he fail the people he has sworn to protect story despite being very long movie the story is an engaging and interesting whodunit which keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole duration the movie had vibes of dark thriller similar to that of seven and zodiac with clues being left by the killer to string along our hero the final act of the movie is the most action packed and some of the reveals presented here are masterclass in way to tell story the movie assumes we know who batman is and his history which is breath of fresh air as didn want to see another batman origin story how many times do we have to see his parents die all in all the story was great with one main flaw the use of characters names what mean is that in long running movie like this you have to remember lot of names and there were times where got confused who the characters were talking about acting every time they cast new batman there is massive fuss over whether they can be as good as the last just like when ben affleck was cast ben affleck is my favourite by the way when robert pattinson was revealed to be batman it divided people right down the middle but can confirm he is outstanding not only in his physicality but his acting capability there are moments where you can feel the internal struggle of his character and the pain he is going through just by his eyes and the way he delivers his lines there are moments in the film where he is silently in the background reading his surroundings and actually being the greatest detective similar to the way he is presented in the comics with massive cast of actors supporting and surrounding him he could have been dwarfed by them but instead he ate up the screen robert pattinson isn the only brilliant actor in this movie with the likes of colin farrell as penguin zoe kravitz as catwoman jeffrey wright as james gordon andy serkis as alfred and paul dano as the riddler each and every actor in this movie gives it their all and are very good representations of the characters that we all know and love visuals need to take moment to congratulate the cinematographer greig fraser dune rogue one and matt reeves war for the planet of the apes cloverfield for making such beautifully shot film with some unique camera angles and movements which were absolutely inspiring the hints of red and grainy darkness throughout this film give it striking look especially in the latter scenes of the movie negative aspect to the darkness is that sometimes scenes were too dark and grainy for me to see what was going on but this was few and far between there are moments of violence that are masterfully shot to show the brutality of certain characters especially batman moving on the cinematography is not the only visually pleasing aspect in the movie as the makeup used on colin farrell make him look totally unrecognisable and the costume design especially in the batsuit being perfectly created for the style of film they were going for we have finally gotten to point where the batsuit doesn look to be uncomfortably worn by the actor another surprising design choice was the batmobile which was basically muscle car but was totally fine with the design as it suit the aesthetic of the film as whole editing with the runtime of the movie standing at hours 55 minutes including credits was worried that it would hinder how the movie was constructed but was pleasantly surprised as the movie had the pace it needed to have feeling of dread there were some slow portions of the movie that could have been shortened or cut but this didn stop me from throughly enjoying this take on the batman the pace was obviously designed in this way and was creative decision they stuck to which respect sound to talk about the sound must talk about the epic main theme expertly crafted by michael giacchino up star trek which is now stuck in my head and the perfect rendition of ave maria which is so appropriate to the scenes it is included in this rendition has an eery tone that is resonated throughout the entire movie with effect there are also portions of this movie that felt like it was straight out of horror movie with great uses of silence and sudden musical jolts and crescendos summary in summary this movie is masterpiece within the superhero genre that has become done this seen that type of genre at the moment the beautifully dark direction the movie has taken with the perfectly realised characters being portrayed by top class actors has got me excited to see the future of what franchise could hold just please keep matt reeves and robert pattinson signed on overall score1.0\tit good movie with some great action sequences and detective work it not heavy on having the caped crusader out of custom ether which was plus for me because let face it here to see batman some parts drag forever and there are few camera angles that linger way to long think this could have been solid hour movie with some easy editing it does have creepy vibe with the riddler keeping the suspense up and has an excellent chase scene less mob better transitioning scenes and few other critiques and this could have been home run it one of the better movies to release since the pandemic and if you have hours recommend checking it out1.0\tgreat movie nice visuals but it is just bit to long why do movies have to be this long in my humble opinion this story was better if it was told in or maybe hours1.0\tit was really well done the cinematography and comic book style of the movie really helped everything flow together think robert patterson did really good job as the batman both the riddler and the penguins performances were superior at times it seemed to drag on however everything tied together at the end no christopher nolan batman but new era of vengeance1.0\tthis was one of the best comic book movies ve ever seen recommend it so much it walking comic on screen true detective story of batman there is lot of action and thriller loved it1.0\tnot much of dc fan but batman had been large part of my childhood watching this movie took me back to watching my mom boyfriend play arkham asylum on the xbox 3601.0\talways find it interesting how directors and writers dare to venture into something that has already been mastered by others making batman movie is just that so many have tried and succeeded for the first time though this would be as worse as it could get mainly because its starring robert pattinson mean hes glitter right but in all seriousness he can act but as batman no way thought to my surprise it wasn to bad this batman character definitely lost masculinity when he unmasked felt was watching spoiled teenager acting out and using his money on cool gadgets but with the mask you completely forgot about that you saw vigilante who wanted to do good and give vengeance to the people of gotham the contrast between those factors give this movie an unsettling feeling of not knowing that you can really trust batmans intentions maybe he would side with riddler maybe even joker they are the same in many ways but wich way does batman lean more into it keeps you in that thought of questions while watching the movie this movie was created for younger audience that is quite noticeable but guess it works in the end1.0\treally love how the actors and actresses and direction of the film really felt like the heros were human and the villains nail coffin hammer one of the better batman seriously robs batman is hands down the best at embodiment of the conflict in bruce wayne and the bat man it is worth seeing on the big screen really loved the colors in the film and how gotham looked so griddy and beautiful at the same time kinda like ya are not sure if the city is worth saving think that all my favorite parts of it is the conflict in the characters think there should be some awards won here naw there will be awards won for this the score was dope to1.0\twas extremely impressed with this movie and was so pleased on how dark it was defs lived up to the hype of batman was so thrilled to hear that the riddler would be the villain in this film but bloody hell didn expect something so dark twisted and creepy loved it and paul dana done perfect job of portraying the character pattinson was also perfect alongside zoë loved it slightly not as good as the dark knight trilogy but it comes very close for me1.0\tmay have to watch this more than once to figure out all the tips of the hat so far it has the feeling of weathermen including the voice over of rohrshach just darker and not not as campy brutal dystopian oh and touch of bladerunner including an always raining city stay tuned1.0\tthought robert pattinson bruce wayne was gonna be emo but wow he really stepped up to the game everyone did fine job in the movie the writers came up with good story the directors created awesome scenes and the actors played the role brilliantly1.0\tdo not go into this movie expecting the dark knight trilogy this is whole new world and story sprinkled with some surprises yes the movie has its flaws but it batman movie that is gritty and grounded and is the batman story we deserve to see in theaters definitely going 2nd time0.0\tnot half bad storyline but watching robert pattinson moping around like bella swan in twilight was just awful plus john turturro was so poorly cast as falcone it laughable the dark sinister overtones are contrived and trite with some of the lines bansal and unnecessary barely worth pirating1.0\tloved this film it returned to batman roots as detective and was almost more of crime drama than an action film with that said the action did not disappoint awesome stunt work and brutal fights the social and political commentaries were relevant subtle and done with finesse this is also perhaps the first batman film with major well crafted character arch spanning the story the batman we are introduced to at the beginning is different than the batman at the end for comparison the nolan film batman begins had great character arch but majority of it occurred before bruce wayne became batman1.0\tthis adaption of batman is certainly different to others portraying bruce wayne as more of an outcast and almost gothic was ambitious in my opinion but they executed it wonderfully pattinson brought the emotion layers and angst of this character to life selena kyle was written artistically complex providing us with strong portrayal of catwomen we are able to empathise and understand her decisions and the way she thinks the film soundtrack was spectacular the suspense and mood it brought to each and every scene was impactful and integral to each scene as someone who loves hans zimmer and his work on the dark knight trilogy equally loved this music but for different reasons you will be rewarded for reading the comic hush as there where multiple references to that comic and clear inspiration the smaller details of gotham was very well explored showing us this beautifully messy city filled with red and black the cinematography was outstanding displaying many beautiful creative and meaningful shots the lighting choices accompanied the camera very well helping drive the darker tones some very creative and visually appeasing angles the fight scenes are well choreographed and feel smooth you feel every punch and kick unlike lot of fight scenes in films today all the movement of the actors and the camera felt very smooth and natural there is much more to talk about with this film but instead of telling you about it encourage you to find time in your week to watch this film instead of reading about it my final notes if you love the character of batman this movie will be different perspective but certainly one you will thoroughly enjoy1.0\tthe batman couldn be darker at least that what thought by the end of it the caped crusader and bruce wayne epic donning in clothes could not have thinner bridge between one and the other in regards to how it dawns upon us people to witness an epic opening of this new version of the batman character robert pattinson surely nailed it as the world greatest detective albeit with slight sloppy here and there which makes sense since he is still becoming and the journey has only begun catwoman stood the test of time as one of the best for taking the role with her both humane attitude and warrior like appearance the batmobile chase sequence felt suspenseful at first and great seconds after with its fresh engine revs and great take on finely designed tank robert pattinson bruce wayne and the caped crusader had this dark appearance that made it look so gloomy yet real the movie gave away visual comic like vibe it felt more like bruce and batman were the same person with costume in or out even though it was not supposed to be that obvious when he donned in that suit it made the scenes gritty and real his voice was not unrealistic as nolan batman movies made them out to be but just little low on the voice sound the sound effects during the few action scenes left me with an aura of invincibility and kept me hooked into the action as if batman life depends on it every punch or kick in the various combat scenes made me think whether batman would prevail or not definitely making the dark knight lot fresher into the world of vigilantism and vulnerable than he could ever be jeffrey wright plays his wits as gordon and decides with all the weight of carrying the law on his shoulders and accommodating the vigilante with everything he can when was going out noticed people humming silly vocal gestures comparing it with the action induced avengers the thing is we are watching dc classics in post marvel world what avengers did was they brought out the justice league thing before it even did in screen time the weird thing is colin farrell was in the movie and yet he wasn cause his face and voice were different which begs the question that he was just cast for his acting and nothing else impression my impression may not be accurate as missed the first half an hour of the movie however for now my initial impression stands at solid for keeping up with the expectation and delivering yet an insightful and damaged bruce wayne and the batman perhaps the perfect comic based superhero movie that consists of reasonable action scenes leaving us with dark and precious gotham city that we all love0.0\tdon understand how everyone is raving what happened to acting batman isn just one person the vampire can be bruce nor the bat and don get me started on cat woman we thought hallie didn do it justice but lenny daughter as pretty as she is fail is it just because they are famous mean even the script was weak thought ben dropped the ball but no this has to be the worst one by far even the villains had me laughing and not in good way super disappointed0.0\tok so everyone is giving this such high praise but it doesn even feel like watching batman movie you could have renamed the characters and not even been batman trying to hard to be noir movie that and looses the whole essence of batman strong fearless smartest person in dc always does prep for everything and shows on time appears and disappearing at random then this movie has the penguin correcting batman on clues and him saying don know more then adam west knocking on doors to get in and constantly to late to save ppl and as well as getting his kiked1.0\tyeah wow just wow amazing characters beautiful cinematography and epic music can wait for the next one please don take too long1.0\thad so much high hopes reading the reviews about the movie don know what these people watched but it definitely not 10 10 movie gave it and that probably pushing it would say this probably my least favorite out of all of them including the silly late 90s ones it way to dark and emo hardly any action once half way through and at the end didn like alfred at all catwoman was not convincing the riddler and penguin were the only highlights of the movie it worth watch but that about it1.0\treally enjoyed this new take on the batman great colours and music three hours long but worth it robert pattinson did great job and colin farrell was unrecognisable1.0\tjust watched this in the theater about week ago and all can say is wow this movie might have just taken the top spot as my favorite superhero movie of all time beating the avengers it dark scary witty and action packed everything that wanted this movie to be it thrill ride of time also it just jam packed full of great moments the whole batmobile car chase scene was thrilling and awesome and the opening sequence was perfect setup to the tone of the whole movie all can say is this movie is well worth your time in theaters or at home paul dano as the riddler just sold this whole movie for me his performance was albeit smaller part in the movie but for what screen time he had he killed it and hope to see him return in future movies my only critiques of the movie are that got little lost in the story halfway through but it all rounded back at the end also sometimes the movie gets so dark and shadowy that it hard to really see anything but that very rarely get what they were trying to go for with the dark aesthetic it batman mon overall excellent movie great characters and awe inspiring visuals and sequences go give it watch if you haven already1.0\tperfect batman movie loved every single second of this whole entire movie best on screen riddler ve seen ever and zoe catwoman brought new side to the character that rarely shown1.0\ttrying to figure himself in gotham city years passed and he still in that dark place while people of gotham city calls him the batman he calls himself vengeance0.0\tthe most boring batman movie ever seen pattinson he was the worst vampire now he is the worst annoying batman and there is nothing about bruce wayne0.0\thardcore batman fan slept in the middle of the movie movie have no flavor and try its best to be deep every aw screaming clapping moment was let down this batman did not do any training the way he was fighting no character development just sad0.0\tthis was the worst and most boring batman movie have ever come across it had the worst build up and ending and the actors that played batman and catwoman had the worst acting for those characters that have ever seen would rather have saved my time watching another movie1.0\tit was just rly ing awesome go see it on the big screen edit imbd says my review is too short so rundown of epicness amazing combat action wonderful sound editing on point cinematography that was illustrative gritty and dramatic lots of suspense great story arc and great job juggling the character arcs and the tone of the script dialogue visual composition harkens back to the comics excellent villain excellent bruce wayne excellent batman dc really got it this time0.0\tconstantly see reviews on imdb from people saying have never written review before but was so appalled by this movie feel compelled to and am now in that camp we all know imdb is full of fake reviews and the fact this film is at makes that fact more definite then taxes this film stands alone for failing on everything that makes film cinematography acting music script chemistry and visual stimulus the batman films have been rebooted so many times and while some may have been less successful then others and may not have been as liked each one has stayed true to several of the above and to what makes an entertaining extravaganza can not express how awful this movie was on every level and if any of the 10 10 reviews are true think must have been hoodwinked by my local cinema in to watching different film labelled batman please save yourself mind numbing hours of dreadful torture and watch paint dry instead1.0\tif you have read batman comic then this is the style of storyline liked it you draw your own conclusion if you have never read the comics this is how storylines go0.0\tthe movie was going fine until the racist slur against white people was thrown in please do not put racist slurs against anyone including white people in these general entertainment movies have told everyone know that the movie is bad and they shouldn see it1.0\tpattinson is fantastic as batman and paul dano is superb want more goddammit loved every minute of it wasn sold on the batmobile at first but it speeding bullet of wrecking ball now love it best batman fight choreography yet even tops the warehouse scene riddler has been redeemed in the cinematic universe and penguin is fantastic can wait to see more of them catwoman was awesome but batman returns still holds the mantle of the definitive version can wait for the second one amazing that they put batman first and foremost over bruce wayne0.0\tif you re looking for storyline in this movie then you ll be disappointed pattinson as batman was skinny boyish version of the comic character nothing dynamic in his portrayal the story content very weak to say the least afraid nothing redeeming full of special effects deviating from any story sad1.0\tthis movie is by far the best interpretation of live action batman the acting is great the music is great and the cinematography is top notch director matt reeves really put his blood and sweat into this film and you can see it in the film1.0\tdidn know about the nearly three hour runtime going in but it surprisingly well paced feeling more like an epic saga than the protracted dress up stunt show it could ve been colin farrell is unrecognisable as an unstylized very human looking penguin robert pattinson would ve been more convincingly tough looking in his bat suitless scenes if he bothered to put on some weight and work out bit more maybe he _vampire_ batman who being immortal doesn need to be as muscular to whack people around lol the bit with the seawall seemed gratuitous like they worried the film scale wouldn seem big enough after all that romping around huge city though but hey you re practically getting movie and half here so it hard to complain imho _the batman_ is solid darkly wacky entertainment with an excellent balance of angst brooding fighting urban blight car chasing and people flapping around in black garb with tiny hidden cameras you know what winning combination that always is if you re like me you ll also come out of it grateful to live in place where it not always dark and rainy day and night and where there don seem to be more criminals and wackos roaming the streets than normal people bonus1.0\tthe first of this film was blown away some say the pace was too slow but argue to the contrary it was 10 at that point in my opinion the last just fell apart for me probably dipped to 10 think there definitely potential for future instalments to improve upon this but great start to solid new iteration of batman1.0\tit not only exceeded my expectations but also turned out to be one of my favorite films of all time it my second favorite batman movie trailing only the dark knight had already known that robert pattinson would be great batman before watched the film but damn his performance was truly something else in my opinion this version of batman was more precise interpretation than christian bale not saying christian bale was bad christian bale was better bruce wayne while robert pattinson was better batman believe pattinson will be one of the greatest actors in his era if you think pattinson is the only highlight in the film then you re totally wrong the direction from matt reeves love planet of the apes was out of the world paul dano john turturro and colin farrell were perfect casts the cinematography and musical score were oscar worthy the only flaw was the catwoman without getting enough character development felt like the character of catwoman was little unnecessary please watch this film in the theater it would make better watching experience can recommend enough of this masterpiece thank you warner bros thank you mr pattinson thank you mr reeves1.0\tthis movie won my heart robert pattinson acting michael giacchino music and that awesome sound effects and matt reeves direction realistic action scenes everything is next level this movie given me everything what wanted love this movie1.0\tlove how the character is finally seen more as fragile version of batman the scenes and images are dark and reflect the imaginative of the comics one of my favourite versions probably the one1.0\twow this is not just an incredible batman movie not just an incredible superhero movie no it is an astonishing film in general after looking forward to this movie for almost years since the first trailer came out in dc fandome have to say that this did not disappoint on single level it passed every expectation could of ever had on this film since that first trailer it demonstrated how well crafted and how much matt reeves cares for the character of batman you can tell that matt reeves did not want this to be standard comic book movie and so thankful for that it allows for the actual character of batman be portrayed exactly as he should be having this new dark and gritty take on gotham and batman creates for an incredible experience it new bold take on these characters we know and love and allows for the movie to differentiate between the blooded genre the acting in this film is also incredible all these characters feel like that character and you buy every second of it they all put everything they have into portraying the characters everyone stands out because of their acting paul dano makes the riddler an incredibly creepy character and really makes this movie what it is paul taking massive inspiration from the zodiac character really sets the character into reality and makes the riddler believable robert pattinson takes new take as the batman and bruce wayne by instead of being the philanthropist playboy that the character was in the nolan trilogy this film sets the character up as broken person trying to get over their grief while not promoting him self to anyone and for the most part staying in solitude it allows for such unique and interesting version of the character colin farrell as the penguin is incredible he completely changed into the character the makeup on him was phenomenal and you couldn even tell it was colin ferrell he also did great as the character and am very exited to see him carry on in future projects zoë kravitz also does great as catwoman and her and robert have great chemistry also loved the relationship between batman and gordon because it showed that the police do not trust batman yet and gordon does because he sees that batman is something good which also presents the fact that gordon is not corrupt while lot of the government is they work very good together in the film also the technical aspects are incredible in this movie the cinematography shows that the comic book genre does not have to look so stale and it can be filled with life the cinematography presents gotham in such unique way and while also being very appealing to the eyes very great colors and almost every scene could see being on someone wall also the sound design makes it an incredible theatre experience having the great affects and score mixing together create an incredible experience the dynamic between riddler and batman is amazing because it shows that both sides think they are the right thing and they are trying to get stop to corruption even though they are on opposite sides this movies direction and creative decisions allows for it to be one of the best comic book movies ever made and compete with some of the best films ever made1.0\tthis is not for everyone as said in the title but it is truly amazing this is very dark and gritty compared to other movies and loved it this is how batman is batman is more on the dark and gritty side of the superhero platform guess you could call it this movie did not feel like it was pg 13 it felt like it was movie and think that good thing about it can stop thinking about this movie and how good the cast was feel like the cast was almost perfect robert pattinson was really good role for batman zoe kravitz was good for selina kyle and paul dano was spectacular as the riddler personally didn think that the riddler was intimidating villain per say always thought he was goofy but in this movie he was actually scary the only thing think its lacking is bruce wayne he wasn in the movie too much and he wasn very different from batman bruce was very sad but also do know that this was earlier take on the batman so that is fine would love to see more of this batman and what matt reeves has in store overall fantastic but it is very dark and gritty and depressing compared to other movies1.0\tbeing much more of fan of marvel in movies games and comics had only watched the dark knight and the joker film before this both of which were amazing movies but neither of which made me love the character of batman both movies were held up by the performances of joker mainly this movie was so different felt so much more emotion for batman than in any other movie and all the characters in this film were well thought out and accompanied by amazing performances no complaints meaningful sociopolitical commentary and it made me fall in love with the concept of what batman could be1.0\tok so watched this movie this weekend and at the end of it was mildly disappointed but that was at first this movie is one that you got to really process if you like it or not after you watch it now that ve processed most of it think it gets little better everytime think about what they were doing with it going to watch it again this weekend and update this but for now it gets better every time think about it1.0\tfinally godd mn good movie from dc since zsjl great acting from robert pattinson and zoë kravitz colin farrell was phenomenal and this movie showed us new batman which is focused on detective scenes0.0\tthat the worst part have seen ever for batman the casting was extremely bad no one was persuading in their playing role the movie was too long and boring batman was not using his car or motorcycle as usual for an unknown reason many people left the movie before the middle1.0\tfirstly this sounds looks and feels like the world of batman gotham city is beautiful with modern buildings showing it evolution whilst maintaining historic gothic architecture straight from the comics robert pattinson completely destroyed all doubts within his first scene he is batman realistic gritty detective showing contempt for the criminal class whilst also unable to walk away from the city he wishes to protect the action and thrills are perfect for the tone of the film and are on par with previous action performances from christopher nolan the dark knight overall the casting and performances were spot on my only gripe and unfortunately the reason this is only 10 is the riddler yes he is unhinged with deadly fascination with puzzles as well as obsession with the batman but his role is over played he comes across less as evil genius and more as an incompetent psychopath feel the story denied his true genius from the comic books but overall his performance is enjoyable until about of the way into the film still it an amazing film that lovers of comic books thrillers and gritty detective stories would enjoy1.0\tnot actually though but the quality of storytelling equates that of the dark knight am highly critical of films and seldom give 10 10 reviews0.0\tfell asleep twice during this movie robert pattinson does not have the demeanor nor the ability to play batman the movie is dark and very emo his acting ability is just not there they tried good supporting cast to make the movie but the directing and main character were just not up to it the riddlers costume as well as batman apparent leather mask and stitched on nose reminded me of some sort of bdsm type outfits will not watch again0.0\tthe film is badly scripted drawn out crime drama with few kung fu fights thrown in it starts off slow and maintains that pace for what felt like lifetime don mind darker spin on super hero movie but just because it dark doesn mean it has to be no fun at all was looking for bit of escapism but the only thing wanted to escape from was the cinema an hour into this snooze fest0.0\tbatman looks super weak and even the other characters are very uncharacteristic the picture is too stereotyped there are countless black rainy nights the picture is very dark and some scenes are even difficult to see the main storyline is very very boring just watching riddler solve puzzles batman solving puzzles and then it endless boring the three hour viewing process was very torturous there was no laugh at all and the plot was even worse1.0\tpatterson was surprisingly good as an emo batman kravitz storyline was boring but the heat between her and patterson was there dano was the worst riddler but the saving grace in this movie was ferrall he was the most interesting person to watch on screen everybody else was bland in comparison and serkis has disappointing amount of screen time also wasn fan of the score just didn seem to fit the mood of the movie honestly thought nirvana was brilliant0.0\twhat terrible choice for such an iconic and loved character nothing about him is dark or menacing horrible choice making vampire into someone he could never be those boots could never be filled with such non sense1.0\tthose who whines about movie is too long is only telling their inability to watch fantastic film because of their short attention disorder maybe for me the movie feels real and grounded this is the batman honestly feel engaging and true to the mythos of batman the whole theatre was gripped till the end the movie take its time to tell gripping crime story the era of tiktoker it is understandable why some people have issues with movie length but if you are true movie fan this is treat and fresh take of the superhero genre must watch1.0\twell done start end music acting story telling directing editing it is tough to follow after what nolan and group have done but this lot have done great job and they did it their way1.0\tthought the movie was pretty good some of the graphics or the pictures were pretty dark and hard to see the graphics emonded me of an older movie and were not as vivid as the christian bale movies wasn glued to the screen like normally am at one point fell asleep wasn as action packed as the other batem but did enjoy it but prefer the christian bale movies with had which has more graphics some scenes were so dark when was struggling to see the cast some of the acting was little off but did enjoy seeing robert patton and different role other than vampire the christian bale movies will always be the best1.0\tlike every other person in the world was massive fan of the dark knight and wasn sure from the trailers of this film that it could really be anything other than letdown it wasn the performances in this film are excellent robert pattinson makes an excellent batman and matt reeves gives us really unique take on the character and some of the backstory the rest of the cast is great but other than pattinson and kravitz colin farrell as the penguin stands out for me he was unrecognisable and perfect for the role adding touch of light but not ridiculous humour to very dark and gritty film he isn overused but he isnt underused either some people have said that bruce wayne is emo in this film and whilst they re not entirely wrong it doesn quite give the portrayal justice the plot and riddler puzzles in general are really well done and the film uses it to throw up subtle but somewhat meaningful commentary about corruption the use of counter violence to fight crime and radicalisation these aren the focus of the film but they re present themes there no super camp riddler no jim carrey nonsense it modern interpretation that stays fairly faithful to the character the riddles puzzles make sense and help guide the plot in way that raises questions reveals answers and keeps the audience slightly on the back foot but put simply this film is fun it got unique style the cinematography is of quality you expect from 150 million budget film this version of gotham city itself is probably the best so far it looks and feels real and more importantly is as run down and depressing as it should be without spoiling any of the plot simply say it must watch and if you re big chris nolan fan like me go into this with an open mind won compare this to the dark knight because it would do neither of the films justice enjoy them both and don worry about the near hour screen time it is earned in its entirety1.0\tmany historic actors have portrayed the caped crusader from keaton to bale the list of actors to take up the role could be its own hollywood mount rushmore robert pattinson more than filled the shoes left by those before him it was one of the first times that we could truly feel emotion from batman and from bruce pattinson truly portrayed broken man man that would decided to wear bat suit in crime filled city loved the movie and hope can see it again soon1.0\tthis was such an intense and immersive experience think the display of gotham was perfect it shown the dark and filthy side of the corrupt city the pure emotion of robert patinsons batman was outstanding this storytelling by matt reeves was genius1.0\tif you got hours to kill are willing suspend your disbelief for bit and see batman do some real detective work like in the old comics then this is great film for you loved it0.0\tthe batman if you re expecting fast paced action packed film this ain it if you re expecting characters reminiscent of your childhood this ain it what it is is butt numbing hour slow paced star wars soundtrack stealing dark lit movie that could have ended at one of different spots but kept on going until you realize bruce wayne oddly resembles brandon lee from the crow before he finally rides off into the horizon1.0\tbefore all ll just say this movie is in tdk level one of the best cbm ever felt like it live action adaptation of that classic batman animated series sometimes arkham games too it more of murder mistery type of movie than action movie kind of has little bit of dark horror this movie has brought us chance to see batman detective skills which is something we ve never seen the action scenes in this movie are more realistic than others also robert pattinson is the best batman for me his performance in this movie is too good his chemistry with catwoman perfect best batcat couple ever as we know riddler is the main villain in this his character is just horrifying personally thought they could have just polish those action scenes in ending still very good ending movie is on point from the start to end it fair to say this is absolutely masterpiece0.0\thave no idea how this movie got imdb rating it must be ether warner bros paying off people to give this movie high rating or it adhd preteens and teens 12 to 15 who don even have the attention span to sit through the movie and are only thrilled to see robert pattinson in this movie but was so confused with the boring and slow pace of this movie and the strange jump backwards with the story of batman thought it was branch of the tv show gotham it felt like more of long boring tv series with small amount of over the top action scenes thrown in am so tired of these movie companies taking these dc movies and always changing the stars and resetting the story lines am so sick of watching the origin story for batman the theater was in was full of 12 to 15 year olds with just small amount of 16 to 50 year olds almost all of the 12 to 15 kids were so loud and bored they would leave the theater frequently because it was so boring they seem to miss most of the movie and it seems the majority of people raving about this movie are very young teenage at the end of the movie when batman comes to save the day the only people clapping were were these young teens but the scene was not impressive it was so predictable other than bunch of explosions there was no surprise in the scene and the rest of the movie was pretty much all night scenes raining or in the dark there was one scene where batman was attacked by three people shooting sub machineguns in pitch black he was being hit by point blank spray of rapid fire one of the teenagers asked if we were watching superman movie or batman movie not only was the scene so dark that the only light was from the machinegun fire but the fact that batman seem to be bullet proof and didn have any random bullets hitting his face was miracle it was so obviously unrealistic it was insulting the entire movie was in low light with yellow tinge to everything robert pattinson and all the stars of this movie tried to do their best with such lack luster script truly feel sorry for these actors as they all have been victims of terrible writing don trust another dc movie they are only interested in making money and leaving the real fans of dc comics out in the cold it was such disappointing hours of wasted time1.0\tfinally dc film worth talking about with the exception of joker this is fantastic insanely well cast all the leads are worthy of award nominations as for the writing direction and production it was all flawless and version of the bat we ve never seen before this is defiantly batman movie and not really bruce wayne story it has the key bits we need to know about bruce but ultimately this is all about the bat which is fantastic in my opinion so different from nolan and bales interpretation that it would be unfair to compare them they are in the same league though that is for sure go and see this film in cinemas before its too late1.0\tclassic in its own right more grounded version without all the unrealistic superhero fluff gritty and dark look on the realities of corruption within the power elite great detective thriller from beginning to end1.0\tone of the best batman and comicbook adaptation movie the cinematography scoring music plot line characther all of those things make this film soooo much cool fr1.0\tthink that unintentionally funny describes this movie perfectly this was the second batman movie ve ever watched after the lego batman so maybe that why my expectations were so high there were so many scenes where genuinely burst out laughing know this isn marketed as comedy but really should be in the best way possible there were too many references or parts where they poke fun at things that are unbelievable in other superhero movies sure that one of the scenes very mind blowing to watch0.0\tthis literally was the worst batman movie ve ever seen it looked promising in the beginning but just went downhill afterwards the visual effects were lackluster fight scenes were bland some gunshots and fists being thrown around seriously save yourself time and don watch this hour long movie really don know how this movie got on imdb it really is more like or around there1.0\tit the best but the ending wasn really good but the rest of the movie was super amazingly insane in good way throughout the movie it has in ur feels1.0\tin this film we see never before seen side of batman in theaters detective batman armored and breaking down robert pattinson consolidates himself as the best batman in live action cinematography and soundtrack worthy of an oscar simply perfect1.0\tobcourse with the sparkly vampire cast as batman there were concerns however he played him very well would have been perfect 10 if there were not some slow story moments that made me want to got to sleep buttttttttt over all great movie great villains great movie1.0\tevery single shot is beautiful the plot is good and the characters man the characters batman and gordon relationship is perfect and like how much screentime gordon has it lot just go watch it don have any complaints and you probably won either1.0\tthere lot to be said about matt reeves take on the caped crusader one of the more common expressions surrounding the movie is that it is dark and gritty version of batman and while that phrase has reached point of being used almost in joking manner it not for nothing one of the movie greatest aspects is the tone within the first twenty minutes matt reeves manages to create gotham city that feels unlike any other gotham city to date it not just dirty crime heavy chicago with different license plates like nolan gotham felt at times this gotham is dangerous uncontrollable cesspool of crime too widespread to contain the film manages to make the city feel so hopeless that it feels almost justified that they would turn to vigilante in last ditch effort to bring some sense of order back it really feels like city where the government has lost control and it not just the city itself or the criminal activity or even the quote strong violent and disturbing content that makes this world feel real and intense much of the credit needs to go to the characters and their respective performances every character feels so grounded within the established world so much so that these characters couldn simply be picked up and placed in any previous rendition of the batman franchise rather every character is written and performed to fit the world that the film creates so that everything feels realistic it almost universal suspension of disbelief even if there are things that may be unrealistic for characters to do or say the characters are so engrained in the world and the world is so clearly established that we don even need to consciously suspend our disbelief the film almost does it for us one can really talk about this movie without bringing up the gold standard for comic book movies the dark knight many people have been comparing this movie to the dark knight given its prominence in the world of movies and especially comic book movies there have also been number of comparisons to batman begins since it was the first of its franchise as well overall feel these comparisons are understandable but unrealistic the only reasonable comparison between the films is the fact that they are part of the same ip other than the characters the batman can fairly be compared to christopher nolan batman films because they are so incredibly different the batman isn sequel to nolan films it isn in the same universe as nolan films and it isn even trying to one up nolan trilogy this is new fresh take on recognizable character other than the fact that this is comic book movie the batman is hardly the same genre as nolan films nolan made exciting comic book thriller style super hero movies matt reeves has created serious detective thriller starring batman there simply no real comparison to be made overall reeves manages to create an enormously entertaining film with impeccable tone great themes an amazing soundtrack incredible performances and some of the most beautiful cinematography to come from comic book movie if you like batman detective thrillers or any of matt reeves previous work go watch the batman you won regret it1.0\tthis movie was masterpiece it was dark yes but also seemed more realistic than any other batman or comic movie really amazing visuals my husband and both loved it0.0\tzoe kravitz did really good job think solid acting otherwise an unecessarily long movie for such basic plot was just waiting for all the things knew was gonna happen to happen don see why people describe it as particularly dark perhaps they mean it in the literal sense because it has little of the rawness and scary elements of the nolan trilogy sorry but pattison feels like cheap parody of bales take on batman too many scenes that shouldn feel parodically cringey does the cinema is one of my favorite places to visit but this time just wanted to leave1.0\tyou can make perfect movie but this is as close as it gets there is wonderful no beautiful lighting and framing throughout as we follow the story which is actually perfect the actors are the characters and everything that happens serves for character growth it is almost excessively entertaining parts certain car chase has me cheering in the theater because they were so freakin well done no cgi in that entire scene it is insane highly recommend probably my new favorite movie also superb soundtrack from michael giacchino and use of the nirvana song something in the way1.0\tcould be recency bias but this is my favorite batman to date robert pattinson and zoë kravitz have great chemistry together all the casting choices were great and really felt uneasy whenever john turturro was on screen the atmosphere and dark tone really make you feel sense of hopelessness throughout the movie it grounded in reality and is how you would expect depressed orphan vigilante would act feel look enjoy the action sequences in this movie there aren many but when they do occur the combat is clean and isn reliant on jump cuts to make it look better there are few clichés in the movie that you have to roll your eyes at but it doesn take away from the experience recommend both to people who are into superhero and people who are just looking for captivating story1.0\twas an amazing batman great take dark and gritty and think the best batman rendition since christian bale however the movie was bit slow paced it took it time in parts but overall was fantastic and kept me on my toes1.0\tabsolutely amazing this is real comic book batman movie hours passed like without even noticing from the first minute of the movie to the credits roll eyes could not be moved from the screen pattinson is the perfect match for the dark knight cowl and cape he has changed the whole impression that he had earlier and converted it in to an iconic bat legacy all the characters are perfectly who would have thought world greatest serial killer zodiac killer can be inspired to riddler and become bat greatest enemy one think need to say is this not tech movie with all the gadgets of batman this is original detective comic book movie and if you don have idea about gotham city characters you better get some idea before watch the movie can not compare with nolan batman inspiration but definitely one of the best have ever seen in dc movie it dark real dark1.0\twent into this movie with an open mind hoping to see fresh take on batman on similar line to the christopher nolan movies almost three hours later had to conclude that for me the batman has never been better with strong performances from every member of its cast fantastic score from michael giacchino and rapidly paced plot that never felt rushed matt reeves has delivered film that expertly balances its character moments with its strong visual aesthetic gotham oppressive atmosphere has never felt so dark and foreboding the hand to hand combat is visceral and the new batmobile is vicious and unstoppable character in it own right although every actor pulled their weight jeffrey wright owning the moral heart of the story as the incorruptible jim gordon zoe kravitz delivering stellar and emotionally complex take on selina kyle paul dano impressively bringing the riddler to life with unsettling parallels to the zodiac killer and colin farrell being almost unrecognisable as the penguin through the combination of prosthetics and an acting masterclass it robert pattinson that excels in the titular role his take on bruce wayne tortured psyche reduced to reclusive phantom who rarely emerges from his gothic abode is particularly effective in expressing the character motivation without the need for heavy exposition upon donning the cowl however his impressive physicality is matched by his intellect in the best theatrical portrayal of batman abilities as detective to date for me it is incredibly difficult to fault this movie and eagerly await future instalments from this latest iteration of comicbook legend1.0\tif one can binge watch ott series then one can watch this gritty moody movie too and mon guys it batman the world greatest detective and the director made an effort to take this movie in that direction and also it psychopath serial killer with twisted ideology making the moves to be established in between the arc so that people can experience the instability of the villain which will inturn help batman of year two to further investigate and take appropriate actions for halting the madness and also it the mood how the batman walks looks observes talks feels and deduces all the information gathered during his investigation partnering with gordon and selina it is long movie no two ways about it as it can be felt but wouldn take away anything from it can be overlooked for the quality and authentic material on which this movie was tailored 30 of the audience will not like it but the rest 70 will be awestruck for sure for the sheer feel of this movie the batman of the comics for real1.0\tnot to fall pray to the confirmation bias but this instance of the batman is very well directed most actors presented their skills to the highest degree using their natural talent to emphasize the narrative this movie is homage to many others but it doesn seem like it was copying them more like it drew energy from the original source and transformed it into something else0.0\twas entertained but batman did not solve one crime or prevent one murder from occurring this movie would have reached the same resolution with his absence from the film1.0\tpeople started to fall asleep at the movie theater people started to fall asleep at the movie theater people started to fall asleep at the movie theater1.0\tthe riddler does what the joker does for the dark knight they took page out of that movie and didn disappoint with this one the movie is bit long but with as much history to explain in movie it necessary0.0\twas looking forward to the darker nature of this film but damn it was terrible pattinson should have never been chosen as batman and can we stop already with the death of the wayne riddler was good but the story was all over the place this is by far in the bottom half of batman movies bring back bale1.0\tit was great the riddler was really great villain he doesn just kill he also plays tricks with your mind the music was really tense and good robert pattinson is good batman this is how batman should be like how raw and dark the movie feels riddler in my opinion is better than joker the clues riddler gives it just really spooky and gives me chills1.0\tfrom the beginning noticed the sad similarities between urban america and the details of the film thought pattinson was good but not great as batman zoë kravitz is great and the rest of the cast is fine the rampant crime and corruption depicted in gotham city could be modern day new york it was entertaining but definitely tough sell at three hours long1.0\tabsolutely loved it rob has made me eat my words he is fantastic batman and you get loads of batman as well everyone in the movie was great the depiction of the penguin and the fighting in the film was very like the arkham video games well loved those so loved this would like to have seen more alfred just because like andy serkis0.0\thours of no plot being stretched out first half is like detective movie with all that voice over narrating and dream journal stuff the whole movie is me waiting for something to happen while the plot is everything and stretched out so thin that doesn feel like the movie is heading anywhere over dramatic camera scenes to fill movie to make it longer creepy pervy batman watching people undress and dress up and builds romance after that so much filler with no real content took nap waiting for things to happen then woke up less than 5mins later and like still don know what going on why is this still not heading anywhere never got exciting they even essentially gave the butler butler robert paterson essential looks like scarecrow from the dark knight trilogy altho they probably tried to make him look like christian bale would describe it also like if adam sandler directed and made batman movie the cast is all random af and most don suit the roles its like batman doesn even know he batman alfred is solving things for him that the real batman would do the worst batman movie worst batcar and worst bike altho those things don make the batman really badly directed they make reference to thomas and martha death at night outside somewhere but also said how thomas as gonna blow whistle on falcone so he gonna blow whistle and destroy falcone then goes out the same night with bruce to what reference to going to the theatre cinema no one who gonna take down mob boss is gonna go do something like that worst script and badly thought of things don make sense the only good things can say about it is that the riddled had his own identity and wasn made to be joker type character which he is not and colin farrell make up was nice amazing1.0\tdidn want to leave the theater after had finished the movie looked for recent showings so can indulge in the city of gotham once more have always liked batman but always felt like the previous movies were always sugar coating the reality of how grimy gritty and corrupt the city of gotham is but after watching the batman can easily say this is the best batman movie of all time personal opinion of course1.0\tthe movie was success really enjoyed the aesthetic and the overall tone of the movie but with all superhero movies it comes down to the villain and frankly paul dano does not get enough screen time to feel like true menace understand that this movie was portraying multiple villains but dano is great actor just watch there will be blood and he should have had more time to put his stamp on the riddler that my only real gripe definitely worth seeing1.0\tthe batman is is masterfully done fincher esque serial killer movie featuring batman despite the cool all in camera action this is not really superhero movie paul dano riddler will haunt my dreams and pattinson made the batman effortlessly own needed more of his bruce wayne persona only drawback is that it lacks compared to its other serial killer movie counterparts plus the annoying use of anamorphic lenses took me out of the movie at times0.0\tnot enough time has passed since the nolan trilogy evidently dc still has no idea what to do with their ip and this proves it pattinson is just blend batman the directing is ok but there are so many things that make the overall product just meh paul dano isn credible as villain without his mask and while giacchino has done wonderful things in the past this clearly isn his most inspired work the main theme sounds like earth vader theme to me had this in my head during the whole movie1.0\tlet me start by prefacing that this was my most anticipated movie of the year and boy did it not let me down the movie was simply beautiful from technical standpoint with outstanding cinematography set design and thrilling eerie and intense score matt reeves is at the top of his game with his writing and directing successfully blending elements of thriller crime horror and action while never losing it superhero comic book ambience robert pattinson provides an original take on the character years into his role as batman as he starts to become doubtful questioning his purpose in gotham city zoe kravitz also stands as selina kyle her character is layered and given quite large character arch which zoe absolutely nails paul dano steals the show and is creepier than ever as the riddler right from the start his performance is unsettling and uncomfortable he is very disturbing while also keeping comedic campy element the character is known for colin farrell and john turturro are very good as well and deserve to be mentioned for their roles overall the movie is an intense thrilling experience from start to finish although it is almost hours long it is not boring in the slightest it remains entertaining and suspenseful throughout its entire duration amazing1.0\tdon go into this thinking you re watching the next great superhero flick dc shines where marvel misses the mark this is film and it watches like one it dark dramatic and cinematic yet still packs some heat with well placed action if you re looking for an mcu comparison you won find one instead compare it to entire seasons of gritty shows like daredevil or gotham than any recent superhero flick my opinion it validates trend ve been seeing lately aside from box office numbers dc is killing marvel right now making watchable movies instead of pop culture fads if this is the trend sign me up this film puts the whole universe solidly on the right track1.0\tthis iteration of the caped crusader is more involved in the story than all other batmen as we see very less of bruce wayne the story revolves around crime and gets you invested throughout the movie and you ll be left humming the background score for rest of the day one time watch is just not enough1.0\twithout any doubt this movie is not only the best batman movie ever made but it is now one of my favorite movies of all time everything about this movie is everything have ever wanted to see in batman film everything about it was fantastic and incredible of course there are people who love it like it and loath it but that should not have anything to do with how you perceive this movie watch it for yourself true batman fans will love this movie the only people that hate this movie are marvel fan boys that can watch movie without bursting out with laughter every five minutes at some dumb ass comedic remark because their attention spans are literally only five seconds long because they can take their little boy eyes off of tiktok for more than few seconds to get some damn air seriously the people that don like this batman movie are the same people that hate everything serious and with any meaning to it you know those guys that liked the new star wars movies yeah those guys and the guys that actually like ben affleck as batman but if you like dark gritty movies and if you are fan of the caped crusader then this will probably be your favorite batman movie too1.0\tthis whole movie just felt like batman like if you combined all the best batman comics and then turned it into movie when people were saying it felt like horror movie was skeptical but those first 10 mins really set the that tone overall loved this movie plan to watch it multiple times0.0\tit better than zack and afflek movie but it can reach nolan and bale masterpiece weak connection between alfred and bruce patissen without mask looks like heroin addict the suit from the torso down is good but the mask on the head is leather ok would watch it second time no1.0\trobert pattinson did complete justice to the role of the legendary caped crusader and delivered an impeccable performance mat reeves did an excellent job with his iteration of the batman the film was incredible and has the most accurate potrayal of how gotham should be thank you mat reeves and kudos to the creative team behind this film0.0\tthis is strange movie it doesn really conform to the normal dc movies although there action all the way through it mostly batman being shot and seeing the bullets bounce off his suit the joker is non character as he appears at the end and you get little information about him throughout the movie go if you must but be warned you might think that was complete waste of time and money1.0\tthis movie has all the ingredients to be the perfect batman movie for the fans to just love it and make it masterpiece yet it doesnt seem to reach that level of perfection at first was determined to pass this movie because thought it couldnt be much robert patterson as the bat couldnt be much thought then saw all of the hype around it and thought hey give it go as batman fan the perfect batman movie should be dark sinister like the comics with great build up and story around the characters the movie starts of perfectly with everything the fans dream off its dark it is sinister and batman starts off like nocturnal animal in dark gotham full of terror but what it lacks in my opinion is the depth of characters and storyline batman is just vigilante with some fighting skills but never shows his gadgets or brilliance that we love to see he never lives up to his potential as super hero alfred is just pass by and his sidestory doesnt get much attention gordon is what it seems an ordinary detective the penguin doesnt get much attention either besides great car chase the riddler is the main villain and he gets attention but more like he some kind of freak like the zodiac in fact this movie reminds me of the movie seven so none of these character were portreyed in full potential and it lacks depth in my opinion than there is something over the top about this movie every scene has theatrical bombastic music even when just nothing happens the storyline is ok till you reach the plot where you feel somehow dissapointed in the end think its descent movie with all the ingredients of masterpiece that batman fans like but it never is it is promising but in the end dissapointing that the whole dark edgy and sinister setting where fans are waiting for never lives up to its full potential1.0\tthis was definitely one of my all time favorite batman movies it was very well done love how the batman movies get more realistic each time new one comes out colin farrell did an excellent job as the penguin although would say that danny devito still did it better zoë kravitz made pretty good cat woman although would say michelle pfeiffer still did it better nonetheless this was great film it was definitely dark and showed the side of bruce wayne that is more realistic meaning he was reclusive and not some playboy rich guy who is banging all the hot chicks in gotham city and love how they did the riddler this movie kept my attention for the entire three hours bravo highly recommended if you are fan of batman films1.0\tfinally the long awaited matt reeves the batman is on the floor and we can easily say it has justified it hype the movie isn your typical super hero movie to be fair to say it probably as anti marvel or opposite of marvel as it gets the movie is slow burner mystery thriller with super hero in it along with your typical cops in murder thriller films the story is engaging throughout while the performances are the highlight of the movie the action setpieces are rare but they are as good as it gets talking about performances robert pattinson as the batman nails the head on the coffin with the rest of the supporting crew doing the justice to their roles collin farrell as the penguin steals the show while his his prosthetic looks is beyond recognition the only negative point about this movie is the length it could have been 15 20 minutes shorter and still would have done the job1.0\tmasterpiece brilliant directive and plot robert pattison really outdid himself in this work of art leaving doors open for the future overall movie left me with incredible experience1.0\tthe batman is stylish version of the caped crusader that breathes new life into an old tale it creative not the usual batman movies it actually serious crime investigation movie not superhero movie1.0\tthe batman is directed by matt reeves who previously directed dawn of the planet of the apes war for the planet of the apes and let me in it stars robert pattinson zoë kravitz paul dano jeffrey wright colin farrell john turturro andy serkis and follows pattinson as the caped crusader who is fairly new in the game investigating murders that involve gotham key political figures first things first this is without doubt very very strong batman film and it is way better than the four films we got in the 90s it is brutal gritty and has dark gothic noir flavor to it and like the majority of the audience have said this feels like batman is in zodiac or seven kind of movie there are things that love about this film but there are also couple of issues that want to address let dive into it matt reeves certainly got gotham city right in every possible way the way it looks and feels is magnificent he made sure gotham city itself plays an important character throughout the film another thing that appreciate about the movie is the fact that we get to see more of the detective side of batman it is an important aspect we did not see much in the previous films the set designs costume designs and art direction are fabulous and greig fraser cinematography is exceptionally gorgeous batman opening scene in this movie is probably the best one out of the nine movies that have been released so far when he showed up slowly in dark shadowy alleyway it just gave me chills to my bones the idea that the audience hear batman footsteps and see him slowly appear in the dark is not just brilliant but also refreshing to watch kudos to matt reeves and greig fraser for pulling that off michael giacchino score is so riveting that it contributes lot to create tension between the characters the film is tremendously grounded and this is the first time we see batman wearing black eye make up under the mask the way it is shot the tone fight sequences production value and writing take realistic approach and that something absolutely admire when it comes to matt reeves filmmaking style robert pattinson who plays the titular character has delivered stellar performance he truly shines in this role and proves that he fully understands the character ideology his combat skills are extraordinary and the way he portrays himself as an angry and broken batman makes his performance remarkable his performance as bruce wayne on the other hand does not quite work out for me he is for the most part stiff his facial expressions are pretty much empty which makes him character that is hard to connect with shortly said the balance between his portrayal as batman and bruce wayne could have been much better zoë kravitz who portrays catwoman is great addition she is not only elegant sexy and fierce but she is also strong character with great arc who works as significant sidekick of batman perfectly jeffrey wright is phenomenal as lt jim gordon his chemistry with pattinson is splendid and he has lot to do in this film wright truly shines as this innocent loyal and fair cop with conscience colin farrell is unrecognizable as penguin but he has also delivered an outstanding performance john turturro was probably the biggest surprise of them all his performance as carmine falcone was excellent and this is probably the best incarnation of falcone we have got so far now let us get controversial another major problem have apart from pattinson portrayal as bruce wayne is the riddler do not get me wrong love paul dano as an actor and he is terrific as the riddler the way his character was built up was also fantastic loved that his character maintained the mystique all the way towards the end of the second act and that is where my problem with this character begins the ideology presented around this character is not as significant as expected his reason and motivation behind his actions are not strong enough which results him to be another ordinary villain the purpose both joker ra al ghul and bane had in the dark knight trilogy made sense and were meaningful and that is why those characters are still considered as powerful supervillains today when the riddler reveals his true identity ideology and purpose it made him look like weak antagonist which affected the movie and my movie experience in bad way another negative aspect found with this film is the relationship between alfred and bruce andy serkis who plays alfred is barely seen in this movie he only has handful of scenes and does not have much to do except telling an important truth in the third act alfred is supposed to be this driving force that helps bruce balance his life as philanthropist and vigilante in this movie however this aspect is not explored at all overall the batman is gripping action packed adaptation that is faithful to its source material batman the long halloween it is unquestionably worthy entry in the dc film universe and it can be easily considered as one of the best standalone batman films that have been released so far1.0\tthis is what wanted this is what want to see in the cinema that is what could pay to see in cinema and also gotham city is blow my face woooow it the wors place to live in the dark the fear the thugs and the batman in this movie it is the best look suit have ever seen before also catwomen is iconic the best catwomen have ever seen falcon also is very good pinguin very good job the chasing cars is the best chasing cars had seen and finaly the riddler wooow man woow woow woow the mind fight between him and bantman was fenomenal very very smart from matt reevs and three hours is short want to mofr from this movie man also hob they will make troligy like the dark knight troligy oh my1.0\tlike black storm cloud the dark knight rises once again above the ocean of mainstream fan servicing super hero movies to transform comic book character into raw gritty almost industrial piece of art the batman is part moody psychological crime thriller part police procedural taking notes from films like se7en or insomnia from the production design to the soundtrack to batman costume and batmobile to the draculaesque wayne manor the atmosphere is dark damp hopeless at times giving hints of an industrial diesel punk world yet through all of this darkness robert pattinson gives us hopeful batman angry nirvana fan vengeful vulnerable morally ambiguious struggling with what batman should be and represent with the idea of batman yet his hopeful side prevails as he saves himself and his city both colin farell and jon turturo shine as gotham crime bosses zoë kravitz is broken catwoman fierce but broken and compromised also the sexiest paul dano riddler is smart and twisted individual weak yet menacing chipping away at the very soul of batman with his wits and mind games the perfect alter ego partly inspired by the zodiac killer both alfred and jim gordon stand as father figures pillars of normalcy and the best allies to the batman all in all the batman delivers reminding the world of who boss who the quintessential character to end all characters the bat0.0\tit official has finally dethroned wonder woman as worst movie ever let me be clear about the refund it the time want back you can keep my 181.0\tstill undecided whether or not it my favourite batman film ll wait till my second viewing but most certainly be in the top not going to compare it too much to batman films of the past but there are one or two similarities think compare it to the moody gloom of se7en or the crow which are of my favourite films which grabbed my attention straight away the casting is spot on and there not one that didn feel was bad choice the tone and direction that this film sets is perfect moving to crime thriller but reminding us that it is superhero movie in places already looking forward to the next film on this new take on the batman batman think we all needed masterpiece1.0\tthe batman was masterpiece robert pattinson is the best on screen batman ve ever watched paul dano was pure psychopath as the riddler calculating and cunning was concerned that he was going to be total rip off of the zodiac killer but while there were certainly similarities he brought out the riddler theatricality and unstableness zoë kravitz showed us true catwoman survivor an antihero and her chemistry with robert pattinson was pretty good loved the depiction of gordon jeffrey wright nails the dry wit of the character along with his authority and his loyalty to batman himself andy serkis while only having small role in the movie certainly made an impression and perfectly captured the relationship that him and bruce wayne have in what little time he has on screen colin farrell was one of the most memorable aspects of the movie he was unrecognizable in his makeup he didn come across as just generic gangster he brought out the showmanship of the penguin in this movie and we ll be seeing more of him in that tv show robert pattinson bruce wayne was someone who was dead inside cut off from everyone and someone who was angry but he was not invincible batman is human being and in this movie that was made very clear matt reeves direction and script were absolutely superb the themes of fear and vengeance were handled brilliantly michael giacchino score truly brought out the haunting atmosphere that batman brings with him wherever he goes greig fraser cinematography was like comic book brought to life this movie is true detective noir feature batman is also known as the world greatest detective and this movie shows us exactly why he is given that name he truly earns it in this movie this is batman who is not the hero that we know him to be he still has lot of growing to do and we see plenty of it in this movie all thanks to the riddler this was perfect and mean that ll give this 10 10 this is very rare rating from me0.0\twhen did action superhero movie cross the line and became this wasted hours of life on it once again pattison should play only vampires for those little girls who get wet just hearing his name still have feeling that ben affleck could do better job0.0\tthis was the most boring excuse of movie have ever seen three hours of my life can get back resent anyone who made this trash movie don understand how it is physically possible to not want to shoot your head with 9mm listening to literally anyones voice in this movie makes my ears bleed as you can hear their voices being forced 101.0\tdifferent from all of them very dark and unique batman this version of bruce wayne is also perfect just want more sequels this one is already as great as dark knight almost if not better lmao fact is that robert batman beil batman in all ways1.0\tafter having my doubts about whether to give this one watch or no decided let keep my hate for wb aside and give this film watch after all it is the batman now to be honest for me the dark knight will always remain the best live action batman film while ben affleck for me is the best batman on screen know most of you might disagree on this but his version of batman is the most misunderstood version now talking about the batman did like the film the answer is yes batman is known as the world greatest detective and none of the previous films showed the detective side of the bat however this one does that we see the detective side of the batman the film is not normal superhero kind of movie it has rather realistic approach to it this batman is new he is just in year two he makes mistakes and still has to gain trust of lot of people this one basically shows us that talking about the acting robert pattison has dawned the suit this time now we don see much of bruce wayne here but more of batman robert pattinson bring his own style this time but however wasn really impressed with his version couldn really connect with him this time around the character although written brilliantly felt pattinson failed to hit the right mark but for me the take away was paul dano as the riddler don know how it happens but this guys always manage to cast the right villains for the bat dano gave lot of heath ledger vibes here when it comes to sick and twisted we only think about the joker but the riddler here is twisted and his introduction is sign of that also wished to see more of andy serkis and colin farel maybe they have bigger parts in the next movie overall really liked this realistic approach from matt reeves he certainly proved me wrong and did end up enjoying the film now to be very honest would love to see the second part for this now however that doesn mean that don want the snyderverse getting restored want both to exist at the same time and now with the news of ben affleck batman not dying in the flash coming out there could be some good news for the snyderverse fans also affeck can also get his solo batman film mean both films can exist in their own separate universe can they1.0\tthis film is something have been waiting for when it comes to batman it feels like it was ripped out of the comics everything from the score to the cast was amazing robert pattinson is the definitive batman he is the perfect young brutal batman all of the supporting characters didn feel show horned in and had their own time and place that worked in the film1.0\tno say this movie surely should have played somewhere around honestly because it something that never been done before and with the references that it has its like more unseen reference so say it was so good in any way1.0\tthis film features commendable adaptation of an iconic batman comic run fear not won disclose which one of the best opening sequences to any batman feature film one of the most fleshed out detailed portrayals of gotham and its politics the most electrifying chemistry between batman and catwoman since keaton pfeiffer never before seen and genuinely convincing bat tech chef kiss cinematography from dop greg fraiser hat tip for the batmobile chase gcpd escape intimate close ups and choice of colour palette some of the best sound design and sound editing to come out of hollywood in recent years classic paul dano performance as terrifying and slightly over the top riddler hilarious turn from colin farrell as penguin who despite the hilarity raises some fundamental questions solid quintessential portrayal of james gordon by jeffrey wright the most complex portrayal of catwoman by zoe kravitz since the goddess herself michelle pfeiffer definitively the best live action batman portrayal of all time by the man of the hour robert pattinson downright masterpiece of score by michael giacchino that will be talked about for decades plentiful new additions to batman plethora of iconic lines and catchphrases this film also features some expository dialogue nominal amount not enough of andy serkis alfred alfred influence on bruce should logically be heavy in his initial years as batman final act that tapers off little bit still ends on satisfying note but the journey to get there raises more questions than answers not enough pay off from the riddler who also tapers off slightly by the end overall solid batman story with great acting interesting if little easy to solve riddles iconic music and fantastic world building that gets you excited for what to come next stronger final act and ending la the dark knight would have elevated it to masterpiece status fans of batman the animated series will love this film ps keep an eye out for barry keoghan1.0\tso watched it at theatre that has these new chairs that move and vibrate with the movie and oh boy was it worth it robert pattinson absolutely kills it as batman he does not over do it with the manly low voice thing all batman now must copy and he actually had some hilarious one liners throughout the movie the movie itself was dark and brooding but in an absolutely beautiful way have never appreciated director so much he had so many beautiful shots and amazing symbolic cuts that play so well with the dark atmosphere seriously one of my new top favorite movies was blown away was it long sure but watched it at 11pm until 2am and it still had my full attention catwoman was awesome too kudos to the director and cast such good film1.0\tbest batman movie ever made all due respect to tim burton michael keaton jack nicholson christopher nolan heath ledger and the like for me growing up in the 80s there was only one batman and there would never be another was nostalgic after all and we all know nostalgia sells ve never liked robert pattinson as an actor nor could wrap my head around the batman being cast by him well today stand corrected bravo to him and everyone involved is this epic love letter to gotham ve watched it times now since it just started streaming ve seen all the batman blockbusters but this this is an artistic masterpiece1.0\tmy favorite on screen performance of the caped crusader yet while don think this film is for everyone do think it perfect batman movie and love letter to fans of the world greatest dectetive astounding performances of the entire cast especially pattinson as sophomore batman who still finding his footing and kravitz as selina kyle dano is as menacing as ever as the riddler and the first batmobile sequence is scene for the ages beautifully shot and aided by an unforgivable score by giacchino this one is must watch0.0\tstruggling to see how so many people rated this movie so highly it slow moving too long and struggled to hold my attention sitting here wondering if the producer of this movie was maybe the film student mother who told them every little thing they did was amazing robert pattinson was fine young batman and the rest of the cast was great but the writing story and pace of the movie leaves lot to be desired it felt as though everyone involved adored the animated series from the early 90s and wanted to recreate it but failed miserably it tries so hard to be dark and intense but it comes across as forced and insincere the scoring attempts to lend an ominous feeling but it comes across as someone impatiently tapping piano keys while waiting for phone call want me hours back after watching this movie almost as much as did after finishing ai this movie was ridiculously overhyped and overrated1.0\tthis movie is amazing greatest batman movie of all time for me the action the way batman is very observant the characters around him are all so unique great cinematography and music1.0\tfinished watching the batman just have to say wow excellent movie it blends elements from seven and zodiac into its own setting really well pattinson is really good as batman he is completely in the role the villain riddler is both terrifying and hilarious at the same time the actress who played catwoman is pretty good collin ferrell is excellent for penguin the actor who played carmine falcone did fantastic job too and won spoil but there very special cameo at the end matt reeves has made truly unique and wonder movie for the audience to enjoy if you enjoy detective thrillers this is movie you can miss1.0\tsaw it on march 4th on imax theater and it was really awesome the sound is like getting into my heart there are really interesting quotes in this movie and the batmobile want to buy one of those first of all if had the money and second if this is an actual car or prototype was really hyped for this movie back when saw the dc fandome reaser and that hype just got increased after main trailer and best of all is that hype is well contained by the movie would love to see this movie hit billion in box office the cinematography and music was delightful what do studio want to do when they have budget of 200 dollars this exactly like this movie did not worry much about the new actors but robert pattinson was fan of him back from twilight also saw the movie again in dolby cinema with my friends and yes it was not at all boring would see this movie 50 times if want to this is masterpiece expected from wb this is the masterpiece that wait so long for like years this is masterpiece wanted from matt am really getting my eyes to see batman in the top of box office chart really this movie by weeks it grossed 250 million won it hit it in 45 days please tell me1.0\tat first was skeptical because of the length of the movie thinking that it was just going to run on and on with no clear ending but feel as though the length was perfect and told the exact storyline it should liked it alot and would go back tomorrow and see it again0.0\thad high expectations for this movie after reading many reviews thought this would be one to watch but overall was huge let down robert patterson didn play the batman well in the opening scene after the reveal of batman without his costume had no idea that was the batman as robert patterson looked more like homeless person than the batman felt the story dragged on and was 3hr waste of the riddler going back and forth watch the dark knight and then watching this sorry to say this was huge let down0.0\tgood reviews on here are definitely fake this movie is awful hate to see so many good actors take part in this garbage miss the days when they made good movies1.0\tdidnt rlly know wht was happening half of the time but when tell you that whenever paul dano was on that screen was gripping the arm rests in the theatre and shaking like rabid wolf good lord he should not be allowed in this movie because of the effects it has on fans in the audience dont even get me started with catwoman and robert too good lord anyways super good movie with the most bodacious actors in it 101.0\tthe batman in the contemporary cinematic landscape to which it belongs represents not only light and precious gem but also small masterpiece this film manages to be at the same time one of the most successful cincecomics it is to all intents and purposes and at the same time transcend from this genre to represent an excellent product in general because if the figure of batman returns to be central beyond any doubt compared to for example the second chapter of the nolan trilogy in which the joker was the main actor of the events and the fuse that exploded the potential evil and murderer in each character there are still many insights that the film offers and the emotions that it intends and is able to convey and they are reflections on society on corruption on redemption on the difficult identification of an incorruptible element uncommon reflections in production especially of genre aimed at wide mass and that winks at the fanbase starting with the assumption that this is film that we needed and that the superhero genre needed in my opinion to make and expose it also seems close to the inevitable to come to qualitative analysis of the batman and the dark knight then proceeding to comparison between the works first of all feel can say that they are both films that take themselves seriously ambitious and dark dark from the settings to the thin thread that animates and marks the relationships and the balances between the characters and their mysteries and secrets they are films of not indifferent duration but enjoyable and smooth able to keep glued to the screen and to take the audience breath away in the latest film by matt reeves batman is perhaps too easily and superficially assumed to be good as the hero who investigates to protect gotham and its ideals but clashing with the scars of the past and with the skeletons in the closet of the wayne house in the 2008 product batman is dark knight almost an outlaw to be hunted down but who is bait for the criminals who come to gotham to eliminate him no one is upright nor are any of the characters devoid of distortions in their souls that need to be activated and stimulated with sufficient little push therefore if plot and message although different can be equivalent in terms of script sensory and emotional impact and depth some particular scenes and sequences here and there in the second film by date of production and distribution have not convinced me for the winking at certain clichés which consequently have not fully convinced me in the dark knight reigns the unpredictability and to withstand the comparison you challenger must be perfect from that point of view even the pauses the timing of the dialogues the shots and the close ups found sometimes bit predictable and banal another aspect in favor of nolan is in my opinion the ability to entertain without real fisticuffs crazy and chaotic car chases fire here and there and especially without real battle or final action in my opinion reeves went too far with the destruction of the city and the psychopathic plan of the riddler he wanted to overdo it and the movie came out too long the result is reduction in realism and credibility of the context of gotham in which the viewer is immersed and which were also strong point in the second chapter of the previous trilogy on the masked hero the riddler is too superficial branded as psychopath and does not have the cunning and wit of the joker he just another madman but can be seen any other way as the chaos and illogic that creeps into society and dismantles its certainties by corrupting its cornerstones in the batman the corruptions and scandals are only revealed and brought to light the knots come to the comb in real investigation of batman while in the dark knight you can see how everything can be reversed and how scandals happen and take place in history and not only included in this one1.0\tll be short everything about this movie is epic the one thing for me that lands this movie on the top of all time is how immersive the audio design is it sucks me right in and feel included in the story line respected as an informed audience audiovisually stunning amazing fight scenes no fake gravity deprived cgi but rich canvas of believable images of universe not so far away from our own it winner1.0\tjust watched the movie and absolutely enthralled by it they ve nailed the detective aspect from the get go and this is definitely the most comic accurate movie ever it is slow moving film with quite decent plot but the pace complements the plot was especially reminded of the movie zodiac which had similar pace and plotline also it doesn at all feel like superhero movie more like police procedural brownie points for the batman winged suit and the muscle car reeves has really grounded the stuff and comic enthusiasts will get quite few references robert pattinson is the new favorite batman in town and kravitz well she is catwoman like how rdj is iron man dano farrel wright and turturro have given quite strong performances but felt serkis is the only weak link in the otherwise impeccable cast another huge positive of the movie is the cinematography literally off the charts had avatar not been slated to release this year this movie could have easily won the oscar for best cinematography however the last 10 20 minutes felt quite needless and it felt like the movie just slogged on after the finale and it could have done just as well without it but honestly it is not as good as the dark knight trilogy but still pretty decent maybe it can even be compared to the other two installments of the nolan trilogy apart from the dark knight definitely better than most mcu movies which rely more on comedy to cover up for their weak plot lines overall it is quite decent movie with gorgeous cinematography and soundtrack but rather long and needless run time1.0\trobert patterson was pretty good batman not very accurate bruce wayne but realistic one the movie could have done without catwoman and her costume was very low budget the riddler was great character but again costume was not it in my personal opinion overall it was good movie but they could have done little better1.0\twhy has it taken soooo long for an exemplary comic book movie to be made we finally have high standard to which all movies should be held am appreciative to everyone that made the batman movie possible this was clearly team effort made of love and respect from the source material the only people who will not like the batman are the ones who like to be spoon fed their predictable entertainment and the fanboys who have spent 15 years being jealous of robert pattinson this movie deserves every second of it runtime and more truly hope this crew has signed on for more batman movies1.0\tbatman the detective like we have never seen the fear of the batman we have never seen combined with great performance by pattinson and the best batman theme that is both haunting and awesome at the same time jeffery wright and robert pattinsons chemistry and true crime thriller detectives at work is just amazing zoe kravitz nails catwoman and collin farrell and paul dano bring fresh and chilling takes on penguin and riddler throw in great direction and story telling by matt reeves and you have in my personal opinion the best batman movie and portrayal to date felt like was watching graphic novel come to life1.0\tthe first 90 minutes of this film are near perfection then it starts to lose some of its steam especially with the final half hour that said the film noir dark gritty intense thriller esque tone of this film is welcome and effective recommended0.0\tacting was great and like that it was dark but it was beyond boring have to say how many times can the same characters be rebooted first time found myself thinking about the number of reboots instead of the substance of film really think it time to let these kind of characters die for generation old enough to have seen all the batmans all the way back to keaton and tired of the same formula and same old villains rolled out again and again plain old disappointed with the lack of imagination in hollywood1.0\twhen you compare it with dark night then its not acceptable because this movie from every angels is more realistic fascinating just for while remove joker from the dark night so it wouldn be able to create that hype class and collections example batman begins matt reeves proved that even without joker how can someone show the best of batman its best ever batman can imagin how much thrilling will be its 2nd part1.0\tsuch an amazing movie big time batman fan and grew up with bale in the suit and tdk has always been my favorite movie and think this finally dethroned the movie considered to be the best cbm of all time the riddler is terrifying in this movie the vibe is se7en meets zodiac and it works so well robert pattinson in the suit works so well everyone doubted him but after this he has proven that he is good actor worth the watch1.0\tthe movie was so good the mystery of the riddler was perfect starting from the plan till the execution of the plan but didn feel like the bat suffered to solve the riddle it was as if he had hints and clues would have loved if it harder for him but that doesn mean the movie was bad the suite was so good only didn like the bat mobile but for the 2nd year of being batman in gotham would say it was okay but rich person like bruce wayne could have done better with the car not going to lie so excited for the 2nd part of the movie if there is going to be one1.0\tthis is what real batman movie is the greatest detective ever it got everything what batman should be dark gritty brutal etc loved watching this movie the cinematography acting fight sequence everything was perfect0.0\thours of absolute rubbish it has no sense no soul just endless dramatics the actor just doesn suit as batman the director whoever is just put so much repetitive tsudf in the movie things that could have been said in minutes to hoyrs to project it is just super slow my advice save your money1.0\tleft speechless never left review but the film deserves it respect to everyone who managed to make batman film feel different and pay homage to thrillers that have come before it can get enough1.0\tthis is the batman wanted from the first live action version the acting of all the actors is very good especially for the villains can wait to see the sequel to this film1.0\tyou see him as troubled 20 something not the suave businessman playboy in his late 40 dynamite movie great story and re imagining of our favorite bat1.0\twonderful dark and entertaining take at batman and his origins thoroughly enjoyed the story cast and cinematography would elude to it being the best batman1.0\treeves and pattinson deliver stunning film delving deeper into the batman and bruce psyche than any other film completely different take on the dark knight than christopher nolan trilogy which adore and one that stands on its feet while building it world do yourself favor and watch it on imax the sound design is too good to be missed along with greig fraser incredible visuals on the imax screen1.0\tenjoyable movie portraying different perspective on whom bruce would have become after his parents death the soundtrack was great and added more emotional intensity on already thrilling action packed scenes superhero fans should definitely consider watching this one0.0\thours of my life can get back the only half way decent part was the car chase since when did bruce wayne walked around like homeless looking bum or with no confidence it self esteem horrible movie1.0\tevery batman fan will like this movie but just not sure they will love it it hard to put into words what don like about it but it just seems to be missing that special something that christopher nolan brought with christian bale as batman the relationship between robert pattinson and andy serkis just doesn feel right it doesn fit the build of the alfred character we all love and some of the other castings just feels off in this movie like the characters don belong in gotham while the story is engaging and keeps us gripped for nearly hours just felt towards the end it lost its mojo and found myself longing to see the credits instead of wishing the movie didn end at all as said at the start fans of the batman franchise will like this movie but not convinced they will love it1.0\tone of the better superhero movies in recent years due to the over saturation thanks to marvel yet the continued slight of hand with regards to political ideology is so tiring for once can watch movie that doesn promulgate their warped cultural political ideology have to be completely honest but the entrance and story along with the cat woman ruined it is it any irony that when women get ahold of something it turns sour enough with the constant lectures on how to think and live1.0\tthis is the closest thing we will get to matching the dark knight very impressive very dark refreshing it is obvious that robert pattinson cares about this role and wants to rival christian bale great stuff1.0\tthis movie is incredible not only do we get to see what think is the best and most different batman bruce wayne adaptation ever but we get to see completely new gotham disaster the atmosphere of gotham alone is horrifying which love because it feels like it gives the antagonist real meaning especially meaning for an antagonist like riddler riddlers plan was not necessarily to harm anybody but to unmask the corrupt and reveal to the so call good gotham community that they live in society filled with rats and singular bat to say paul danos performance as the riddler is amazing is truly an understatement he presents himself to be so realistically psychotic whilst also presenting himself to be true criminal mastermind this movie is insane and although it has long runtime which may cause people to get lost in the plot or the riddles it is still masterpiece and the best batman movie out to date1.0\tmovie is just amazing one of the finest adaptation of batman to cinema movie brilliantly explores the detective side of the batman screenplay is also great matt reeves really grapse the tone of the movie one of my favorite thing of the batman is the cinematography and sound track its 10 10 movie one thing didn like about the movie is its length 15 20 minutes can easily be cut off from the movie otherwise its great movie to watch1.0\tthis is the best batman movie ever watched beacuse it have great start with characters matt builed batman character so well excited about movie think this batman better than nolan batman1.0\twhat great and wonderful film watch after long time the story and the motive of riddler is so good and batmans motive too what great beginning of great story and character arc the best batman movie after nolan verse this is just great gift for every batman fan1.0\tsuck when it comes to reviewing movies but this is my second time doing it so this is more like first thought although watched this movie couple of weeks ago my reaction after watching this movie was the same after watching the first teaser this is superhero movie that ve always wanted while the movie is so heavy on the story some people may find it boring but honestly it didn make me bored at all rather find it interesting because matt reeves nailed it and this movie feels like crime thriller or detective type of movie such as se7en and zodiac which is two of my favorites movie ever and my other favorite thing is the actors performance especially paul dano as the riddler his performance in the arkham prison scene always reminds me of heath ledger as the joker and of course lot of people will be comparing those two in years to come not surprised if dano gets nominated for the academy awards next year and of course the cinematography and scoring by greig fraser and michael giacchino are extraordinary think personally this is the most beautifully shot superhero movie to date1.0\tcan easily say it was one of the greatest batman stories ever told this movie was like medicine to me after seeing ben affleck awfully represented batman robert zoe and others casting was on point cinematography was brilland can even have words for how good soundtracks was really appreciate matt reeves for making riddler the main villain of this movie instead of the joker am really happy to see real detective story and not some save the world mission1.0\texcellent 10 out of 10 movie if like mysterious sick crime movie full on detective young bat with good cinematography not cgi superhero movie1.0\tbeautiful cinematography and the roles and well performed by the whole cast creates many emotions for the viewers since the music used is too powerful1.0\tyou need to go to the movie theater and watch this movie you won be disappointed this is different type of batman movie not like the ones that were directed by christopher nolan1.0\tdon know if it was robert pattinson or matt reeves or michael giancchino just at loss of words probably the most realistic version of the batman different approach in terms of cinematography given that it superhero movie beautifully written script and no batman theme has ever failed us1.0\tso for little while lost hope in live action batman movies and such but this movie really rocked the dc live action franchise at the start of the hour long movie found myself little bored tbh confused on what was going on and wondering who the hell are these characters as they were unrecognisable so moments got me going what the hell but as it got on and the movie evolved it turned into an amazing final act watching everything come together after hours and 20 minutes as gotham falls into utter chaos due to the riddlers amazing final riddle batman going into full on worlds greatest detective is so satisfying the soundtrack is soooo good would give it solid 10 would love to see another movie1.0\tthis is the best batman since the dark knight and think it surpasses it also the riddler was one of the best villains in batman movie paul dano played the role of mentally insane person so well0.0\thow dare warner brothers even put out this garbage ve never been so bored seems 1989 was long time ago in three abysmally long hours you couldn develop anything of value wb for the birds1.0\tso yeah it was sick loved the way they gave the riddler horror vibe to him and let just say he played that well and the hole story was amazing and the actions could go on and on and on of how good the film is but have to go and see for your self and the last scene1.0\twhen this movie was announced with pattinson as batman and zoe as catwoman immediately wrote it off are you kidding me so many times ve seen one of my favorite comic characters portrayed on screen and the closest they ever get is maybe modest 70 to what batman feels like to read was wrong robert pattinson please accept my apology you knocked this out of the park really can put into words how well you did as batman zoe kravits you may have portrayed the best catwoman ve seen in decades you were perfectly subtle yet explosive all at the same time absolutely amazing writing superb it captures young batman who is starting out so well and gives him fantastic growth opportunities before the end going from vengeance to hope is huge shift loved it acting probably the best ve seen in superhero movie yet characters like gordon alfred and penguin were so well acted and written production was amazing love the focus on the simple sound effects for batman like his footfalls punches etc overall plot was amazing and so well organized this is easily one of the best batman movies ever made pattinson was so dang good in the role this from someone who though pattinson peaked with his harry potter role money well spent and stingy with my money1.0\tdie heart fan of this movie the best thing is that my best friend also like this movie that why watch this movie than fifty it characters are looks realistic and fit for every role1.0\tstory is great and unpredictable you cannot predict the story easily and the cinematic of this movie is great but what like most is paul dano acting become the riddler is very scary and psycopat1.0\tokay so am going to start this off with an unpopular opinion the dark night is overrated as is heath ledger joker ledger is better than the movie overall though okay done what this movie gives us as audience members that nolan never could are emotional connections to the characters real moments of human connection even when it is one mask in front of another even then we see the connections the characters have and make and we are pulled into that drama nolan dialogue exists to tell you what has happened what is happening and what will happen next reeves has managed to breath life back into the charcter no small part due to pattisons flawless performance but also because he knows how to tell story wthout telling you how he is telling story if you get me he uses plot to build the legend of his characters and to drive their personal journies it is dark it is fresh it is everything always wanted from batman movie and never got batman 89 came closest and was until this film my favourite batman but this film steals the show and by huge margin grew up watching the tv show repeated on morning tv in the 80s as small kid then later the animated series when 89 came out was and had to wait for the video but have seen every other itteration in the cinema this was the first one that took me back to the childhood love for the charcter and his detective work had and to the 89 version and the excitement had for batman then have that excitement for this vision of batman and the possibilities it holds for superbly realised version of the caped crusader pow1.0\tthe movie was good in general robert pattinson zoe kravitz and paul dano gave very good performance the movie is detective movie batman bruce wayne tries to catch him with the clues left by riddler the worst of the second movie could be the joker you will see scene with the joker in the movie barry keoghan will play the joker good day from me1.0\tbatman is dark fun action packed and almost little creepy film based on the comic books the characters the direction and the action are all perfect michael keaton is the perfect bruce wayne batman as is jack nicholson as the joker the rest of the cast is also very fun and bring colorful characters tim burton is also genius director making the setting gotham city look very dark and dreadful1.0\tthe batman is fantastic take on the character that we haven seen in live action before the acting story cinematography and score were all right on point most things that did not like about the movie are minor nitpicks am looking forward to watching it again1.0\tthe batman is the most different and most comic accurate batman to date we finally get to see the world greatest detective in action on the big screen it set in his early years year when serial killer the riddler tests his detective skills positives the cinematics in this movie were absolutely stunning was in awe of every single shot if you are watching this movie you have to go to imax every actor in this movie fulfilled their roles robert pattinson did really good for this role and paul dano was outstanding they nailed all the action scenes you will feel goosebumps in that batmobile scene the riddler scenes were executed perfectly negatives this movie was definitely too long they really could have cut off lot of scenes for the theatrical cut this movie held you till the hr 30 min mark after that found the movie slow and the 3rd act was bit messy paul dano definitely did not have enough part in the 3rd act slow aftr while but you ll enjoy1.0\tvery gripping film robert pattinson has an incredibly magnetic screen presence one simply cannot look away from him the film is visual treat and the story is very well written incredible cast and everyone had great chemistry the music is mind blowing the ending left me wanting more really hope there will be sequel zoe kravitz is great catwoman batman and catwoman had the chemistry that makes you wish they get together finally robert pattinson really killed it despite talented cast it was mostly all on him if he wasn good the entire movie would ve fallen flat but it doesn he makes brilliant batman and mysterious intriguing bruce wayne can wait to watch it again1.0\tabsolute weapon of movie would say great action all around completely different from nolan franchise pattinson is really good in the role very intimidating zoë kravitz also very good as selena kyle like the dark and grungy style of the movie the music and the sound of the movie is very good and not to forget the new batmobile which is unordinarily cool0.0\tit so bad for the title of batman as the sucked acting of robert pattinson which is nothing improving from decade ago within twilight think he is bad actor as same as kristen steward no matter how they could be promoted the script of this batman is complicated illogical and clumsy thumps down definitely0.0\tthis movie wants to be joker moive but it is not than it wants to be super hero movie but it is not also altough there is really superb parts pattinson camera work etc film is so slow paced without proper rhythm and with soooo much unnecessary dialog in it there is so much spoken words in this movie that is hard to belive it guess this script needed few more drafts too bad because there is lot of potential in this vision of batman0.0\tit was decent almost fell asleep few times the dark tones of the movie were enjoyable well done on riddler part and all the actors really felt like it should have ended few times before it actually did it dragged near the end it still worth watch hopefully the sequels turn out better1.0\tthis movie was so hot everything was sexual in the best way possible was unable to supress myself and beat up patrons outside the theatre afterward am vengeance1.0\tso like most dc movies it was full of dark backgrounds but bit better this time instead of speaking dialogues they like to whisper so miss out few punch lines but all of sudden the action sound is too loud the batmobile was not so sexy in this one everyone was like they dont like robert pattinson performing the batman but his face was shown like 10mins in the movie so should not avoid watching it because of him and he did good job performing the role batman was helping in police investigation so that was weird like why he is acting like detective or say consultant cat woman part was greatly inserted in the movie and the storyline was good with modern reboot the ending showcased there will be sequel in continuation with current story line so that would keep dc fans happy1.0\tpattinson is absolutely amazing as the caped crusader in this movie grew up watching batman on yes mean the original batman in the 60 and have seen every iteration since then will admit love them all each for their own unique take on batman but this one may already be my favorite the entire style of the movie cinematography is so gritty and raw was sucked into his world kicking and screaming with fear the whole way the riddler is absolutely the most terrifying batman foe thus far in any batman movie or show the only problem may be how they are ever going to be able to make the joker scarier than the riddler but am salivating at the idea it has been just over 30 hours since saw the batman and cannot wait for the sequel this will be the longest few years ever my only hope is that they make the movie shorter even as an admitted die hard fan of batman and especially this version would love for the movie to be more succinct my only problem with the batman was that thought they should have ended it 30 45 minutes earlier but am nitpicking if you love batman promise you you will love this movie0.0\tthe cinematography was really well done the riddle pretty good but then wondered how such low life guy has got access with such little resources to such an elite group of criminals that not even bruce wayne knew about that catwoman is in constant pain and knew where everything was gonna happen in advance before the very other people even were aware of it the motorcycling scenes terrible so frealing corny and over dramatic just the penguin and andy serkins were an excellent performance beside it felt overacted and over reacted ah and that batman felt as if it was not even sure of being alive so just not someone who inspires me to be better nor person can connect with super long felt longer than zack snyder cut really expected something much more deep and thoughtful from the movie but then it was just massive hold out until one figures out who the main villain is because it does not appear at all until it is unmasked so well1.0\tcinema at its finest the movie from the start was dark exactly how batman dc movie should be the acting in this movie of every actor was out of this world specially riddler and the soundtrack directing and the action sequences was just top notch for me this batman is more darker and the casting is way too good every actors played their role perfectly my currently favorite movie just simply out of this world loved it1.0\tthis film blew me away exciting fast paced surprisingly gritty and genuinely had an awesome story great music great special effects ve already booked to see it again again very different type of hollywood blockbuster that also sees batman taken in new and exciting direction when it comes to feature films the batman is an artistic and considered epic that sets in motion tale that can be continued soon enough1.0\tafter recent disappointments in hyped up films was pleasantly surprised with the batman after the dark knight trilogy it does so well to be its own piece when you think it may have no ideas of its own but it really does it well directed with some great performances featuring great score with some amazing action set pieces ll admit it very dark at times found it hard to focus in on the detail the story is very dark but it the first batman to really ink out the dread all around this may disappoint few fun fanatics but it helps with the tone of the film at times it felt like it was dragging but it really ramped up near the end there feel from films such as seven the crow zodiac pattinson really does his own thing as the batman it reminded me bit of the keaton version but at times there real power in his stare his physicality there lot that not so obvious with the performance but really felt it at times zoe kravitz is sleek and powerful too and think it one of her best roles to date paul dano is just off the chain as the riddler but is enigmatic to watch really like colin farrell penguin too so unrecognisable not just in make up but in his voice there tiny hints at times of the previous films not sure if intended but found that really nice reminder of what loved about all the previous works here and there the finale really lifts things up where you may think the film lags and is the most superhero moment where everything comes full circle in what the batman stands for my only criticism is the running time which ll admit did fly by but wonder how it ll effect other movie goers patience the lighting is so so dark at times it just kind of ruined the detail of the set designs it fine but might make you nod off but highly recommend this and curious to see more from this production1.0\tyes the film was dark but rightfully so the shadows were perfect the visuals so raw especially for blockbuster the cinematographer greig fraser ran the footage through film pass as part of the post processing to elevate the grit there also particularly awesome car crash sequence involving maserati and an angry new bat mobile from batman sweat streaked eye makeup to cat woman chic wardrobe alfred confidence in his role atop wayne manor against falcone calm demeanor the film took realistically grounded approach to highlight the kinds of people that would fill such broken gotham city its clear need of deep cleanse is forced to the viewer by the constant rain the riddler reasoning actually made sense while he did his thing making his presence even more chilling the fact that you almost want to agree with the villain is terrifying the film was held back by the lack of deep character relationships the wonderful acting helped to balance those problems since the casting was top notch really across the board surprising choices proved themselves however many characters were so lost in themselves that it made it difficult to see any genuine emotion come through when dealing with others maybe it was testament to the state of the city but doubt that christian bale bruce and michael caine alfred had the connection to potentially move you to tears at times that missing emotional interlocking made it difficult to really cling on to the high steaks of the film but there was enough to leave me satisfied at the end of the hour experience the batman is high on the list of comic book films taking risks with visuals staying edgy with its genre and narrative and not making story about humans feel so godly with that cast and crew they can afford to build on those emotional connections to make the second film truly something special the seed is planted1.0\tlove the movie can wait for the next one was blown away didn expect the movie too be this good robert pattinson did great job of been batman the director and cinematography was also great and editing want to see it again and follow the clues again also great detective movie1.0\twent into this film with very high standards considering the films we ve had before by the end of this film was left speechless my standards were met and exceeded can say anything wrong about this film other than maybe tweak the prosthetic on colin farrell face matt reeves knows what he is doing with batman ve always had this dream film where robert pattinson plays terry mcginnis and michael keaton reprises his role as old man bruce wayne so was bummed out to hear he was playing bruce wayne instead but was still happy for robert because feel he good actor that unfortunately lived under the shadow of stephenie meyer so it felt great to see him get big role like this that being said robert pattinson is first actor since michael keaton to nail both bruce wayne and the batman was so impressed and in awe by his performance some honorable mentions for me are falcone selina and gordan this film didn have as much action as the christopher nolan films but feel it had better set pieces overall could keep going about this film but feel ve said enough so ll end by saying this highly recommend you go see the batman in the best theater possible you don want to miss this experience it one of the best ve had standing ovation to matt reeves now let see if he can make even better sequel0.0\tthe screenplay and storyline were so weak it was also too long with lot of slow filler scenes the main soundtrack is also extremely boring and the nirvana cover kills the energy so many bad creative choices robert pattinson also had basically no acting to do at all so it like detective movie with some punching can think of single scene that stuck with me it really not with watching fanbois will love it because they love everything about batman this doesn even come close to the nolan movies1.0\tnot going to give long essay but really thought people were kidding when they said it was really good love it it isn the typical happy go lucky movie and the depth was great would definitely recommend1.0\twell made top actors great acting loved the work this and dark night is the best superhero movies of all time was not too sure of the main actor when the chose him but congrats what role he played definitely one of my favourite movies now1.0\tthe movie is very dark and intense and full of raw action the color tone of the entire film defins the movie that is the batman the film is very much realistic in action as well as in color contrast the background music and score gives goosebumps in short dc is literally on fire1.0\thonestly we needed this batman movie to show how dark the batman is and for robert pattinson performance is perfect for year two batman best teaser best soundtrack and best movie editing all though the movie is very long hour to be exact it worth you re time trust me1.0\treally good film and good batman all the actors do great job and catwoman was great and can wait to see part with joker and mr freeze and can wait1.0\tenjoy this installment of the batman franchise but still ranks behind the last two movies with christian bale overall the movie was entertaining and kept me interested all the way through to the end0.0\tin my opinion this movie is meager 10 gave it 10 because there is just no way so many people gave this 10 10 when you look at these reviews they all call it gritty and the best ever or straight up stuff like the batman this generation deserves which roughly translates to what up fellow young people said by sixty year old man wearing yeezy the film is okay but not worth watch went and saw it with two major batman fans who both fell sleep it is very slow and predictable movie the action scenes are too dark and the bad guy is just way worse version of kevin spacey in se7en robert pattison shouldn play bruce wayne because he just portrays him as an angsty teen going through goth fase zoe kravitz actually pleasantly surprised me she portrayed catwoman well combined with her role was this the only thing in this movie that scored 10 it probably best you don go if you re major christopher nolan batman fan0.0\tnever left the cinema in the middle of movie so boring movie fall in sleep so many times and woke up on guns sounds don waste your money on this movie0.0\tthere only one thing that sure about this movie is not worth 10 nor 10 10 rating and with that being said find it pretty much overrated1.0\tmust admit was coming into this film already hating it the idea of robert playing batman just didn sit well with me how wrong was at the start of the film was getting like crime thriller vibe didn even really feel like batman the solving of the mystery by following the clues it was brilliant best batman movie ve ever seen without doubt anyone that doesn agree just simply likes to disagree for the sake of it batman murder mystery film that my take and highly recommend seeing it didn want the movie to end1.0\twas pleasantly surprised by the film and really enjoyed it which had good plot and was visually spectacular the batman himself was very impressive as always as very underrated actor so definite winner1.0\tit been so long since enjoyed movie this much loved every minute of it the acting cinematography action characters everything was phenomenal paul dano as the riddler was terrifying and he delivered such an amazing performance it really doesn feel like hour movie because it just that enjoyable please go watch it everything about this movie is perfect you won be disappointed1.0\tthis version is one that batman comic book fans from the early days in the 80s and 90s will understand reeves borrows from batman yr1 yr2 long halloween and detective comics during the norm breyfogle alan grant years and brings the audience dark film noir detective story that makes you think and react throughout the film not your typical superhero movie but worth look at1.0\tlet me start by saying that didn think robert pattinson could pull it off when heard he was cast as batman but he did an amazing job there were numerous scenes that were had me awestruck am glad detective batman gets his run in the dc multiverse the exploding rooftop first glimpse of the batmobile open scene and countless other scenes were both cinematography works of art and story telling genius0.0\tif you like cringy overused monologues dialogues and very very forced romantic scene then this movie is for you this is the most boring plot and could have been done in under hours but they drag it out so long and add in very unnecessary romance scene like why the movie covers good themes political corruption economic inequality illegal activities but they tried to cover so much that they just butcher everything and the villain was barely in the movie and honestly the whole hours is just depressed dude solving crossword puzzles1.0\tim norwegian why do all the hollywood idiots put in the white privillige thing in their movies is it bc themself are white and privilligied and has to virtue signal1.0\tbatman is based in this movie ve never seen another batman movie but is this is the best one ve seen the cinematography is amazing and every performance is great the riddler is great and spooky villain while having great motivation1.0\thonestly must watch picture yup little dark in some parts but overall loved the theme batman gotham say they portrait batman as detective and put so much thoughts in solving riddler crimes his body language and the way they made this year batman so scary in the whole movie that really made criminal scared to death first they build the city where batman could fit and showed that its the city of bat criminals were so powerful that dealing with them isn child play he wasn just the vigilante but also the hero the city needs think every part of this movie was precious to the story and pattinson really put strength in the character batman1.0\tthis movie is incredible haven been this excited for film in long time the batman film has some of the greatest cinematography plot and soundtrack for superhero film this film is superior than spider man nwh endgame and infinity war because it is epic dark violent dramatic and horrific all at the same time this is highly recommended for fans of dark gruesome dramatic mysterious and detective films1.0\twhen they first cast robert pattinson as batman of course like most was very skeptical just like was when they cast keaton and affleck was completely wrong then as am now and glad was pattinson immediately established his presence underneath that cowl and made the character his plus we finally get to see him do true detective work in this film an element the previous films were sorely lacking1.0\tthe scenes and shooting angles of the movie are very rich in terms of cinematography it is very realistic to process the self knowledge process of character like batman you feel very much that batman is human and the scenes exist in real life1.0\tfinally good batman movie after dark knight series must watch movie great story and good acting by all start cast robert pattinson was at his best1.0\tvery promising start with extremely good cinematography paired up with gloomy vibe and some nirvana the inspiration from se7en is noticeable and brings new interesting take on the detective superhero character also enjoyed very down to earth batman playing with his gadgets and how these were used by the director to tell part of the story sadly after the first 30 40 minutes the movie starts becoming more predictable and some parts even seem unnecessary for what ends up being pretty simple storyline that drags for almost hours despite the above still worth paying the cinema ticket1.0\tthis is must see movie one of the best comic book adaptations ve ever seen and every aspect of the film story music cinematography tone etc will keep you engaged despite the runtime being almost hours great acting from the cast and great directing from matt reeves can wait to see what the future holds in store for this franchise1.0\twas very surprised when heard robert pattinson would be dawning the cape but it did not disappoint hours just flew by not saying it better or worse than previous batman movies it just seemed to fit for the now definitely enjoy seeing darker much angrier and troubled version of bruce and batman the music fitted perfectly and you can 100 see that pattinson based his bruce wayne look on kurt cobain the bat mobile muscle car firing up was one of my most favourite scenes and sounded great in the isense cinema paul dano riddler is far from the days of jim carey comedic still great riddler but more reminding me of jigsaw from the saw movies really felt there was good chemistry between selina kyle and the batman executed by zoë kravitz nicely would have liked to see little more of colin farrells unrecognisable penguin but feel it definitely won be the last time and we will be seeing him again in the future also outstanding performances from andy serkis and jeffrey wright look forward to seeing more of this films should it happen1.0\trobert pattinson nailed the role he was too perfect this is one of the best batman films of all time in the history of hollywood request every dc and batman fans to watch this in 4dx to have the best experience1.0\tsaw it twice in the movie theatre love this movie from beginning to end the direction from matt reeves the music from michael giacchino the performances from the cast including robert pattinson bruce wayne batman the action sequences the story the tone everything is phenomenal it not only one of the best batman movies it one of the best dc comic book movies of all time this is masterpiece can wait for future matt reeves batman movies1.0\tbest sound best picture best batman the real life one the movie shows mega city of sodom and gomorrah gotham an example of dark corrupt and sinful city which is waiting for the divine torment but there is one hero who wants to save it by vengeance from the crime and criminals ever one how is corruptive corrupt any way the version of the batman this actor gives the real life batman if he lives among us and how hard he would suffer not fairy tale that is all thank you for this great movie mr director producer all cast specially the music ones thank you you you love you too much love you love you love you love it when you are so beautiful so you may follow me on the same page as you are you can you add you love you can publish this blog with at least 150 characters this is so crazy annoying stupid and funny come on finally got time to sleep1.0\tthe batman is an enjoyable movie period really like the acting the story giacchino score and the characters am looking forward to watch it again someday1.0\tshows you how childish mcu fankids are when they try and give this film 10 after not seeing it because they know it is better than anything marvel has ever put out period dc marvel go cry about it kiddos1.0\tit literally hour dark noir film it perfect it has real substance something superhero movies have been missing the first three quarters are definately better than the ending but nonetheless it delivers it gorgeously asthetic grieg fraser has killed it in this film and dune back to back go watch it it worth your time1.0\texcellent direction screenplay and dialogues by matt reves paul dano as riddler nailed the character robert pattinson has given top notch performance of batman all the characters were excellent go experience it in the bigger screen1.0\teverything about this batman was great the cinematography script and theme was amazing do see one thing that lot of people say and totally agree on which is the distinction between bruce wayne and batman in this film you only see his batman side even as bruce but the movie does set up lot of developing points for this1.0\tin my opinion it was the perfect depiction of year batman was gripped the whole time and can wait to see what happens with this batman in the future1.0\tlike the film but it is not perfectyyyyyururuurururururueurueururururururururururururururureuueueueurururueueueueururururueurrurrururururururruueurueueueueurueueurururueurururru1.0\tamazing there were so many many moments that literally shivered the intro the music the plot highly recommend watching it absolutely worth spending three hours in front of the screen1.0\trobert pattinson and zoë kravitz did really impressive job portraying their respective characters matt reeves also have to get massive credit for both the writing and directing of this movie0.0\teverybody very liked the movie but this movie terrible just slept for hours boriiiing think they played the wrong actor and the subject was so bad there was no action scene in the movie1.0\tloved every single aspect of this movie see great potential to what they can do with battinson in this new saga the cinematography alongside with the score of this movie mix so well together it gave me chills every time batman appeared on the screen must watch definitely in my opinion the best batman movie have seen1.0\tthis movie exceeded my expectations it was everything wanted and more the stunning look of it matt reeves exceptional vision the cinematography the brilliant performance of the cast the captivating storyline the music the definition of masterpiece work of art almost hours long and still couldn get enough of it cannot wait for the future of this batman1.0\tmatt reeves has outdone himself in this movie we have seen few of his art work on the apes trilogy and others but this movie has it little touc of both nolan and fincher movies first of all don expect plot that that the batman going to beat out the villain and just won this is not that average plot of other superhero movies this kind of movie belongs to cinema few factors lead me to saying that is first the cinematography almost every shot in every scene was made carefully the color tone they were using just fit with the darkness of this movie and also the scoring every time batman appears and also in other scene was hell of ride it was just perfect and was loud that it makes our seats shaking besides that the cast has done very good job on their acting especially paul dano although with his innocent face he can still give that creepiness sensation to us the mystery driven story is very unique and was roller coaster keeps giving us surprise and made us wait impatiently on what going to happen next if your light story superhero fan that just want to see the ending of the protagonist defeat the villain this movie will not suit you this is not your average superhero movie also for kids it need bigger comprehension therefore recommend you to watch movies on imdb top list the movies example that similar to batman are se7en the dark knight zodiac and others and to understand what good movie is you should watch christopher nolan david fincher and tarantino movies1.0\tthis movie is the best batman movie ve seen since the dark knight this has the most badass batman ever you can expect everything you want in this film it is so good that you want to watch it again and again and again and again it is dark gritty violent beautiful in the whole dc universe1.0\tit takes lot for me to go to an actual movie theater when saw it was robert had to go it was worth every penny wow love the chemistry can wait for the sequel best batman since michael keaton1.0\tit was nice to see truly young and unexperienced batman who discovers himself finally truly dark knight it displays the darkness in heroes life and he is finally human not superhuman who can defeat whomever without even taking punch also nice way to explore the pre supervillain gotham and see how the city has evolved since batman began his activity there incredible cast great film1.0\tthis is for sure one of the best dc movies for my opinion can put this movie in the 2nd best movie after joker it very unique and dark and loved it0.0\tthis movie is brutally slow boring and is fraught with bad acting whatever effect the director is trying to achieve with this noir melodrama it is far from the mark not going to say anything further as have nothing nice to say may god have mercy on the hours you ll never get back after you inevitably watch this movie to spite this review1.0\tthis move just did something no one would expect its well writen story with no compromises overall amazing execution but little too long for audience to keep up with everything this would be better than the dark knight only if it was shorter and more dynamic in some scenes throught1.0\tthis is really true batman movie we all lnow that batman is greatest detective and this movie delivere it enjoyed it lot it fills my expectations and the story was epic the puzzle thriller suspense and last 50 min was awesome after the dark knight this will be my best batman movie1.0\tthe movie was really great this movie is not an ordinary superhero movie this movie is higher than superhero movies batman is more of detective than an unnecessary battle scene and blends with the action and the action scenes were pretty good there are some shortcomings in the movie but hope they will fix these shortcomings in future movies but mistakes are very few of the success of the film the movie is really good just people who want action won like this movie but if you know and love batman and want to see his detective side this movie is for you1.0\tthe batman movie feels like it is trying to redefine the character in bold new way but it falls short of accomplishing that goal in many ways there have been many iterations of the character from keatons extravagant dark knight set in the 80 to bales heroic savior and most recently afflecks grizzled batman who takes pride in his work yet there no one way to describe pattinsons bat although that might not seem like problem it is the initial feeling you get well watching the movie is enjoyment however hours after the film when you ve thought about it little more the curtain drops and your left wondering what message you were supposed to take away there is so much potential in this work reeves created hopefully in the next movie he can find his stride and make his version of batman more clear and distinct1.0\tthis movie has raised the bar can believe saying this but the batman has edged out batman begins the cast was phenomenal zoë kravitz colin farrell paulo dano are superb honestly can wait for the second part and the spin off series0.0\tdidn really like the movie great photography but didn see the actors acting except for zoe is more environment moro photo than anything there not dialogue and scenes actions it suppose to see young batman but is it 35 year old actor is ypunger than other versions and scrawny batman and didn like how he wear the suit sorry very emotional dark bur in the riddles are the only good thing in the movie1.0\tit was very good watch her with my 11 year old son was amazed of how good it was riddler is so scary and it thrilling but there almost no blood would watch it many more times0.0\tdisturbingly bad movie just got home and there is no way can recover from these hours of pure suffering for the first hour hoped something would start to happen but it didn so it was in the remaining hours pattison desperately tries to be some bad ass actor but he is essentially just depressed this role is not for him he should stick to romance movies don understand how film like this has such high rating1.0\treally enjoyed that there was hour movie with lot of batman think that was the whole point pattinson version of bruce wayne wasn meant to be the experienced playboy bruce wayne that well known he is too consumed with being batman alfred had to get on his case about it that it annoyed bruce bit that he told alfred that he is not his father in way like he was being nagged but alfred was concerned that being batman has taken over bruce life to the point that there is hardly any bruce left the mayoral candidate that he was doing nothing to help gotham as philanthropist like his parents did pattinson was doing what the role was written for him to be thought he did great with what he was given1.0\tit done in way that felt like great detective story with great story and characters action was good maybe little more action the ending1.0\twhat masterpeice this movie is it is good competitor to the all time great the dark knight movie robert pattinson has acted so well and fitted into the batman role perfectly matt reeves direction is superb action scenes story acting background music everything is just perfect will go to watch it in the theatre second time1.0\tpattinson as batman was the teet perfect kravits as catwoman was smokin good story everything was perfect accept think they forgot to hire lighting guy serious this was like watching movie with the brightness set to dark people in the theater where complanin as well what just happened couldnt see nothin was said by so many seems like every time they makes batman the film looks darker and it just doesnt work other then that it was so good1.0\twhy did it take them this long to deliver batman movie on this caliber this movie delivers everything ve always wanted to see in batman outing and more matt reeves contributes to make his mark in hollywood with special thanks to his master work on his two apes films the batman however takes his style and elevates it to level wasn expecting many can look at this movie and say that pattinson is by default the star but for me matt reeves is the star of this movie giving us iconic shot after iconic shot in gotham city that has never been more well realized until now the production design is off the charts and the mood is dour everything need for gotham want to see again and again even if you walk away not liking this movie highly doubt it would be because of lack of director vision can honestly say that this doesn feel or look like any other batman world ve seen before and that after over 80 years worth of batman content robert pattinson delivers the most grim fearsome brooding and brutal dark knight yet he plays this role unlike any other iteration ve seen before this is the first time ve ever pitied any of batman villains before and the brutal takedowns they suffer in this movie batman doesn necessarily kill anyone in this movie but sure several of his victims die later due to unrelated brain hemorrhages and this is all due to one specific thing that pattinson has brilliantly brought to the bat rage we ve never seen an angry batman before not like this sure he had outbursts in the past but ve never felt as though anger is what is driving this character before and that probably due to the fact that batman has always had his moral compass in check in previous iterations almost as screenwriters never wanted to get their hands dirty with the morally questionable areas of what oftentimes drives the bat rage and most importantly vengeance batman is called vengeance for most of this movie for reason it as though this batman enjoys beating criminals to pulp with his bare hands in this movie and that just something we ve never gotten in batman movie before and pattinson brings this to the forefront of the title character but something wasn prepared for was just how compelling he is as bruce wayne there only ever been one instance where actually felt that bruce would rather be the batman than mr wayne billionaire playboy and that was batman returns with michael keaton pattinson feels for lack of better word damaged like he can for one single second let himself forget the trauma he suffered as child and from trauma births angers and from anger births vengeance and from vengeance births brutality and all of this is something ve always wanted to see in batman movie and now we finally have it the movie is rounded out well with wonderful side characters each one perfectly cast in their respective rolls paul dano continues to for lack of better phrase freak me out his riddler was the stuff of nightmares someone who shows that all you need is enough motivation to bring city to its knees never saw dano in this movie saw only the riddler demented serial killer who personal motivations are only matched by the bat zoe kravitz delivers perfect catwoman and he chemistry with pattinson is off the charts she just as fractured as the bat and her motivations are just as strong jeffrey wright is someone never would ve even considered as jim gordon but after that original teaser trailer gave us taste of what he had to bring can now no longer imagine anyone else playing the roll if you had told an unknowing me that collin farrel is penguin in this movie wouldn have believed you his prosthetics and most importantly his voice make the man unrecognizable and 150 believed him as ozwald cobblepot michael giacchino music always elevated the material he scoring no example is truer of that than the batman being probably my favorite score he ever produced the batman simplistic theme is utilized perfectly building off of two notes to loud brooding and dark warning that is almost guaranteed to get stuck in your head the riddler theme begins eerily childish and then explodes into chaotic harmonies and brings it back down to something simplistic which is very telling of his character catwoman theme is probably my favorite seeing as am fan of jazz can almost see the cigarette smoke at jazz club at 3am listening to this track what more can say it stunning and biased being pianist myself so therefore it shouldn be any surprise that my favorite track is sonata in darkness which is an amalgamation of the bat and cat themes solely played on the piano it gorgeous piece that ll go overlooked as it the final track on the soundtrack album if you re fan of giacchino encourage you to check it out overall this movie really is the complete package if you re fan of psychological thriller horror movies you re in for treat if you re fan of batman you re in for treat if you re fan of cinema you re in for treat though it not for the faint of heart as someone who has been anticipating this movie for the better part of two years give it flying endorsement it three hour movie that feels like two and is easily one of the finest comic book movies ever made and running contender to be my favorite batman movie of all time0.0\tthis entire movie acts like social media and smartphones with cameras haven existed for the past 15 years while also leaning on pretend technologies that don exist what old person wrote this thinking it would connect with modern audiences all this while being as broody as high school play written by an overly dramatic 10th grader not good project for robert pattenson don even blame him1.0\tthe batman 2022 is thrilling detective styled movie that turns the world of gotham and batman into almost real world town the performance by robert pattinson as the batman is great in the sense that he is only years as the batman and is still flawed and in need of maturity and experience and you can see the arch that his character makes as he essentially goes from being vengeance to the batman symbol of hope the batman being great detective in this film pairs nicely with the riddler in this film who is best described as self righteous psychopath who is played by paul dano who really brings to life the madness of the twisted character in disturbing yet entertaining way this film is the kind of movie that gets better the more you sit back and think about it1.0\twriting was very weak directing was amazing batman presence whenever in scene has never been better he never felt so bad ass pattenson as bruce wayne was very hit and miss very emo kid with some terrible dialogue like your not my father like gtfoh lol cat women some bad acting at times but mostly bad lines like to see her again in the role jeffrey wright was the worst part of the main actors his over the top fake old school ny cop voices would have been great for kid movie or cartoon but for movie with serious seven type movie it was out of place and took me out of the scenes not to mention he felt dumb which is also due to weak writing end of the day movie could easily be with small teaks and different cut reeves is amazing the best looking and most bad ass batman we ve ever seen the sequel could be epic and believe in reeves to deliver some people talking nonsense about another fake woke movie just cause there black actors don make it woke lmao update seen again in dolby it must audio is amazing and completely different experience but gordon is the worst written and acted character still and all the cops corny lines and over the top delivers just razzie worthy take away from some great scenes but after watching again loved it even more1.0\tsimply speechless from what witnessed today the writing the characters music literally everything the investigation theme and the police station in sense is just great and loved the new clothes for the riddler and jeffrey wright killed it as detective gordon can wait for the new movies1.0\tthe movie begins riddler commits his first murder and then my soul enters the gotham the first half of the movie impressed me so much that couldn sit still an amazing cinematography and an amazing piece of work1.0\tfantastic detective movie batman is great bruce wanne seens autistic beside this bad bruce wanne really enjoyed all charades and suspense of the film excellent ending1.0\treeves and co have crafted comics accurate neo noir version of batman which in my opinion is great way to put the bat back on the big screen since his last appearance in nolan the dark knight rises the batman has tightly woven narrative strong visuals an ear shattering score and powerful performances especially from pattinson who plays batman as raw and desperate vigilante who by the end of the film learns to become symbol of hope for gotham while also maintaining his status as ruthless vengeance seeker is very commendable his bruce is recluse who must find the humanism himself again which is teased at the end of the film although the film suffers from plot that can become over complicated at times this criticism should dissipate if you see the film few more times and have film brain on you there also cameo from certain character at the end that is pointless and would have worked better as post credit scene in conclusion admist it minor problems reeve the batman is cinematic triumph that in my opinion sets new bar for the superhero genre in an age where all this types of films are cgi mish mashes matt reeve and robert pattinson the batman answers back with cinema1.0\tlove this movie in almost every way it dark like batman movie should be and all saying is that if you haven watched it you should definitely give it try way better than the dceu batman1.0\tthis is good movie with an good plot and story but one thing make this movie little bit bad yeah its about pg 13 if this movie got an rated think it will be better1.0\tmatt reeves not only delivers the best live action depiction of the long halloween comic for the nerds but true masterpiece of murder mystery crime drama that felt so grounded and horror like in real world that just happened to have batman in it robert pattinson brought one if the most emotional performances we ve ever seen in the lead of comic book film and that brings me to the best overall consensus of this review this does not feel like comic book film is it better than the dark knight would have to say no but that okay because it is still 10 out of 101.0\tsome may say the length was long but thoroughly enjoyed the movie and as always dc villains don disappoint us the riddler did great job penguin was fantastic we had the best catwomen and the main man robert pattinson batman was superb overall 101.0\tjust watched the movie and can tell that is one of the best movies of all time the acting the shots the music were phenomenal speechless of you are really fan of batman you will definitely enjoy this movie1.0\tthe batman movie we all have been waiting for ladies and gentleman how the movie depends on your expectations if you prefer superhero film with tons of actions moments full of hope deviaing from reality then this film is not for you but if you re fan of the genre of crime noir investigation and have been dying to see the detective batman in live action then this wiil exceed your expectations why is the movie three hours long well it had two important jobs to do create the environment around batman in way that it feels fimiliar full of life depressing life actually city that goes well the plot not some out of context city out of nowhere just named gotham and let each of the rogue gallary member time to shine remember why tasm2 failed loved the comicbook references in this movie the character development was at it finest the intrection among them was decent everything in this film was grounded the action the story everything battinson was great but cobblepot and the riddler stole the show for me really liked the zodiac killer inspired riddler the cinematography and the score was phenominal it has become my one of the most favourite movies1.0\twent to see this movie today and before that read reviews of people saying this movie is great and am always sceptical about those because usually people don know what they are talking about at all well this time they were right not many movies stay in your mind after watching it you forget them but this one is the one who stays in your head for very long time because when credits roll you think wow the best batman movie have seen way better than those nolan batman movies or the ones that came before1.0\tthe batman is an amazing psychological crime stopping movie the cinematics are so gorgeous that every scene can be used as wallpaper for device all of the fight scenes were captured and acted on well robert pattinson performance was top notch he my new favorite batman now the ending scene just makes me wonder what matt reeves next project have in store hopefully they introduce underrated villains like hugo strange or killer croc0.0\tactors was hmmm not there pattenson did really have any thing to say small lines jim whispered all the time bad guys did really have any power og bad attetude just bizz ppl trying to control others no purpose 10 music and sound loud then nothing and so one no them music action sounds diden bring the movie up whit sound or music 10 lighting effect dark in non good way grayish and dull action effect only when car burst out of flames was nice fight scene was dark 10 so overall bad movie to long to boring dc just disapoint again done with them0.0\tif someone has any respect for the batman movie legacy and the great actors starred in it all this years remove this homemade batman movie there is nothing of what we expect for batman character1.0\tfor years couldn understand why we kept getting mediocre batman in love action it shouldn be so hard to being this character to life and thankfully the team behind this was successful0.0\tve watched more than thousand movies this one is the worrrrrrrrrrrst have ever seen just don waste your time to see this sh this movie is just too noisy and slow1.0\tthis movie is amazing from the soundtrack to the cinematography to the characters and the acting to the writing this movie was flawless it brought superhero movies back down to earth and had much more realistic theme to it and was so dark and twisted which made the movie so much better didn think batman film could top the original bale movies however this one did and robert patterson absolutely killed the role as batman the bar was high after spider man nwh due to all the hype surrounding that movie and this film managed to go above and beyond that bar it has restored my faith in the dc movies and can wait to see where they take this movie1.0\tmatt reeves is genius and the cast acted very well because what he made from the comic book it is totally different instead of starting the beginning he started after years he became batman brought my sister to the show she was so interested with the story plus robert pattison hot body0.0\tthis has now been the 8th actor to play batman and now just feel like this is getting old know they tried to give different and spin on him this time but honestly did not do it for me also robert pattinsons performance was sub par it felt little over acted and just boring another point creating spin off tv series for the penguin just seems like money grab milkshow all in all just save your money and time and do not bother watching this movie unless you are looking for hour nap session1.0\tafter years of waiting the batman has finally arrived the review is right after the screening so do not know if it will be objective and cool the direction and photography of the film is amazing every frame is really for poster in the room it shows you in such beautiful way gotham rot it has better aesthetics and atmosphere john turturro as falcone is very good andy serkis as alfred is very dignified and more in the time given to him colin farrell as penguin is fine even very well although would love him for longer jeffrey wright as gordon is the big surprise of the movie he is very different gordon we have never seen before zoe ravitz is great as catwoman it still too early to tell if she better than michelle pheiffer paul dano as the main villain of the movie riddler is incredible found this zodiac version great at times really felt fear and dread watching and listening to him he really was excellent robert pattinson as batman can now say with confidence that he is for me the best batman and the favorite version of the character yes he is the most violent batman the wounds are not closed yet he looks so angry and that why love him the music of the film is amazing it dresses the scenes so nicely giacchino begins and slowly becomes one of the leading composers now all the accessories like uniform batmobile how he uses the hooks and so on are all awesome finally dc you let director show his vision and the result was seen1.0\tfor all those who ve reviewed to complain the film is too long this is what well paced character centric movie is supposed to feel like don get me wrong love the avengers and all the marvel movies sadly though they ve robbed us of our ability to enjoy proper film this doesn feel like superhero movie at all yes he dressed as bat but if he wasn the movie would still totally work as standalone noir detective thriller it really would you could have made this film without batman and just had bruce wayne colin farells penguin is great character hope to see more of him zoe kravitz has been receiving rave reviews but felt she was adequate the absolute star of the show is pattison absolutely 10 10 superb he is generational actor and him and timothy chalamet are the best actors we have right now moving forwards pattison is better batman than bale this adaptation has the best gotham the best score the best batman and the best cinematography of any other batman notwithstanding an era defining heath ledger this would be my favourite batman movie but the dark knight still pips it but only because ledger is better joker than dano is riddler not to take away from dano performance truly creepy incel serial killer if hadn seen there will be blood then he have absolutely blown me away but feel like already seen dano do pretty much the same act so it tempered his performance only ever so slightly this is paul sunday in gimp mask overall just fantastic movie with pattison being the reason why will definitely go back to the cinema to watch second time in the coming weeks1.0\tpowered by matt reeves masterful score and respect for the source material the batman is triumph in every sense of the word it not just gritty but sometimes downright scary the riddler is unlike anything we ve seen before in batman villain performances across the board were superb specifically pattinson as batman and zoe kravitz as selena kyle wish the third act was more satisfying and that alfred had more screen time but other than that this is perfect batman film taking inspiration from batman year one and the long halloween comic storylines this film weaves all those tales together to craft something really unique that we have never seen before in comic book movie yes some people are going to say it too similar to seven or zodiac but actually enjoyed that aspect made it feel believable almost as if any one of us could become batman if push came to shove1.0\tcoooll gshnejdisjdj very amazing liked it very much holy cow it so good like omg jsnsbjsuabshsua9nq wiainajwwunwnwnwowown isisnejhehrbbdhdjrjdjdhsususususuudyd6 djjdjrbdhehdhejenjehhrhrhhrhrhrtrh1.0\tthe batman is perfect example of how to bring comic book to life there being so many great things about this movie the casting of robert pattinson as batman paul dano as riddler jeffery wright as commissioner gordan and especially colin ferral as the penguin was totally unrecognizable the cinematography is out this world truly amazed and bgm was spot on and right now nirvana something in the way is stuck in my head even if you don know much about comics you ll love the movie for many different reason but if you are dc fan or especially batman it treat from matt reeves to fans and thank god wb didn mess this up1.0\tfirst of all the batman is an amibitious movie from the beginning of the movie the batman starts to hype you the movie starts with murder and then quickly shifts to batman narrating this movie does good job of striking fear into the heart of the criminals when the bat signal lights up people who have titans season will find major easter egg in the movie the movie also does good job of hiding the identity of riddler till the very last hour the movie does job in striking fear in the hearts of the people of gotham about the riddler the movie revolves around revelations murders and distrust among the people of gotham of batman this is not spoiler if you have seen some non spoiler videos about batman but in this movie in his 2nd year the movie revolves around some of the most famous batman stories like the long halloween hush the dark knight returns etc catwoman in this movie drives the plot forward and is major help for batman she also forms relationship with gotham the batman movie has very good pacing and good musci and for the full movie the hype builds around batman the movie batman brings some major elements from previous batman movies and also brings something new my review 10 why because the movie is very slow and the movie can cut 20 30 minutes and the music is repetitive at lot of times you will get what are you expecting from this movie and much more also was looking forward to one major thing but it was not ther you will be shocked on what is there and what is not also nothing in the batman trailers tells the final fight scene which is very different from what expected this movie in all is thriller gory and noir film with hint of comedy if you understand all the time you will be in the edge of your seats and some major revelations will change your viewpoint about batman and this revolves around one major arc which you will notice after hours of the movie the movie is way longer than you expected this completes my review if you want something more please tell me also there are some easy and very very hard riddles there are ciphers too you will get everything you want and more1.0\twent into this movie with the highest of expectations and did not come out disappointed this is complete new batman to the ones we ve seen in the past this was dark and thrilling film one that be watching many times again although there wasn much backstory unlike the nolan trilogy this is fresh perspective as it skips straight to two years after he became the batman this makes the film more original compared the previous ones yet inspired from the classic murder mysteries we ve seen in award winning films like se7en1.0\tthis is the definitive live action batman in my opinion although not the definitive live action batman movie that still tdk pattinson tortured batman still very much scarred by his trauma doesn have the playboy bruce wayne persona he just wants to be batman all the time wants to help others but honestly is kinda suicidal first and second acts are perfect third act isn necessarily bad just could ve been better the resolution to the mystery is bit underwhelming probably needed big plot twist to finish on high note that said it still great movie1.0\tthis is the best batman movie so far so much detective work action fight scenes and chemistry this movie is must watch for superhero content or action movies in general each of the cast member killed their role if you re thinking about watching this movie please go ahead and watch it you re definitely missing out if you haven seen it already0.0\tjust an awful movie like to go into it but there just too much just total collapse of the batman idea really hate what woke hollywood is doing but sure won be the only one saying this movie is total garbage crumple this bag of dog sht up and throw it away1.0\twatched this expecting to be boring 3hrs movie as am more of marvel fan but this is was amazing robert pattinson did really great job and zoe kravitz was amazing great movie all over1.0\tladies and gentlemen present to you masterpiece the batman is the best batman movie ever made the plot develops at pace that makes the viewer feel the anguish that dominates gotham character development especially batman bruce wayne is masterfully done it requires the viewer to watch the film with an active posture in order to understand the plot in its nuances warning anyone who expects to see hero movie using the saturated and cliché formula children humor simple story practically non existent that screams everything you need to know may be disappointed1.0\tsince the first trailer was skeptical about the batman as someone who likes batman but can do much with superhero movies that take themselves too seriously the movie seemed to go in the completely wrong direction for me after watching it however my impression of it is better one despite its length the film has good level of suspense and is all in all simply an entertaining movie but the qualities of the batman lie in being good thriller not in being good superhero or batman movie the film would work just as well and wouldn lose anything if it were rewritten and regular detective was used as the main character all the batman specific stuff is among the weakest parts of the film for me the opening narration seems more like parody as if teenager wants to sound meaningfull dark and edgy robert pattinson as batman is the biggest miscast in this role so far or rather robert pattinson as bruce wayne because he plays him like an emo teenager as batman he has little impact because you could have really let any actor play this wooden emotionless portrayal of batman thanks to the costume no one would have noticed difference either kravitz as catwoman delivers solid performance but not much more the lack of chemistry between catwoman and batman is certainly not her fault but pattinson liked the portrayal of riddler while the penguin seemed wasted for this movie and his portrayal was more like that of random mobster all in all film that lives entirely on its exciting plot but introduces what found to be very uninteresting portrayal of batman more in line with dark and edgy teenage hero fantasy1.0\tgo see this movie if you haven my 17 year old is making me go see it for the 2nd time not really recommend for kids under 13 it little sppoky1.0\t10 10 movie surely one pf the greatest batman movies ever robert pattinson killed it with the acting matt reeves is goddddd the audience went mad here the dialogs are on point must watch movie1.0\twas afraid of hours as usually think two hour movies are long but it was not the case with this movie loved it it was dark real and scary it is not typical comic movie with laughs unrealistic characters etc this is real world corrupted polititians psychopats and people who make mistakes and above all it was detective movie so if you go into it expecting comic movie for kids this is not it but if you want dark masterpiece then this is for you it masterpiece1.0\tit completely different batman movie but can say that the end of the movie is like this masterpiece as cinematography they did their best can say that this movie is very good crime thriller know this is the first movie in the series but the ending could have been better it seems to me that some part of riddler character motivation is missing think the character chosen by the director for the new movie was unnecessary we dont need it there are some nice little details in the movie watch carefully like this movie it was worth it1.0\tif there one thing that we get from dc movies it how they keep missing the mark on most their films but not this time this movie will stand amongst the very few dc movies that actually good what makes this batman stand out from all the previous batman films is that we actually see batman the world greatest detective actually solving crimes rather than just knocking bad guys out robert performance as well as the other casts all did excellent job with colin performance being unforgettable the visuals are outstanding and makes the size of gotham larger than you can imagine this movie hits all the right spots sure it hours 56 minutes long but you don mind it when you get lost in this amazing film it non stop crime solving butt kicking action film with amazing wardrobe and performances1.0\tthe batman what do we think when we hear or see this name masked vigilante in cape fighting crime and getting justice for the victims or masked freak who is disrupting the plice officers and performing illegal activities like coin has two sides batman also has sides people who love batman love him people who hate him call him freak this is batman movie but not bruce wayn movie so dont expect to see bruce wayne doing his playboy act by day in order to blend in the society but instead this movie focusses on the batman who deals with crime and solves them this is the first batman movie where we are not shown the death of the waynes and it let us assume that we know they are already killed and as the team said this is batman in his second year of crime fighting so dont expect much about the past and flashbacks now let me talk about all the major details about settings tone and characters in the movie one by one gotham city this is the first time where felt as if am in this city itself these neon lit streets and those vibrant displays amazing lighting and dark alleys made me feel alive as was watching the movie this version of gotham is one of the best we ever got music michael giacchino has completely blew my mind and soul away the music is soo great and comforting that every moment the music plays made me feel alive and felt sense of relief listening to this music even in the credits too now lets talk about the cast this the crucial points that people talk about in the entire movie penguin aka oz if say to me that this is colin farrell would reply by saying are you drunk or am blind how can this be colin farell oz looks like someone else oz just made mind blowing performance his role is less when compared to others but he stood out and his jokes were well timed and he was the one who gave the best chase scene in the movie carmine falcone john turtturo played an amazing role he always reminded me of the carmine falcone from the long halloween book his role is also one of the most important as he is the pivotal role in two of the best twists in the movie don think he is dead though selina kyle zoe kravitz is the perfect actor for selina kyle she just rocked man she plays vital role in getting all the info to the batman we see her as person who likes to play disguises and work in the club to get what see wants loved every scene with her and batman and the tension between them was great hope see comes back for the sequel jim gordon jeffrey wright is the best gordon ever period this man is the next most important person after the batman in the movie jim gordon acts as companion and friend to the batman he just rocks as jim gordon no more words man just watch him in the movie riddler paul dano dont know who this guy was and didn watch any of his movies but gotta say he rocked this version of riddler was one of the best versions have ever seen either from the comic books or from the movies he was genuinely scary and amazing at the time he is my favorite character from the movie next to batman and gordon he is just amazing alfred andy serkis potrays alfred as good and intelligent man think he is not much shown in the movie hope he gets soem more screentime in the sequel but the less time he was he acted good batman words for robert pattinson batman best batman ever that it am not gonna say anymore you watch the movie this movie is one of the best movies ever this is one of kind and the one of the greatest comic book movies ever made hours of time made me feel less tbh wanted more this is not normal superhero movie this is comic book and movie for comic books fans please don compare this movie with marvel movies otherwise will be hugely disappointed this my friends is investigation crime thriller and scary movie which heavily reminded me of court of owls long halloween and arkham knight game ps this is cinema martin scorsese1.0\teverything in this movie is so well thought people behind this movie are oscar winning geniuses it is absolutely phenomenal in form and technicality you must definitely watch it1.0\tlove the film the action is amazing and the fighting seen and acting is so good love the new batman suit and the new gordon love the ridder loved the ending and the first scene we see the batman and the song something in the way and the film is so dark that loved and1.0\tdc has finally embraced their role in the superhero stratosphere as the darker and grittier comic series and did so without any unnecessary gore or over complication right off the bat ll say robert pattinson was thrilling in spite of my premature doubts in his ability to fulfill the role he is the most believable batman character to date aspects appreciated about this movie no wasted screen time on foundational story lines this movie assumes that you understand bruce wayne and his ascent into becoming batman so the full movie directly relates to the present timeline they didn make this love story between batman and catwoman and good god zoë kravitz did the damn thing they made batman fallible and more of recluse he truly gets rocked few surprising times and it reminds you that batman really is just human who doesn do everything perfectly they also stay away from the flashy bruce wayne in this movie he is rarely in public and love the long unkept greasy hair dirty face bruce wayne it very believable in tying his appearance to his emotional state throughout the movie robert pattinson stays away from settling into simply being emo batman he shows bruce as an extremely emotional and fragile character without succumbing to the twilight edward cullen type of brooding that lets be honest we were all afraid of for this movie great casting for every single role bought into every casting choice for this movie did mention zoë kravitz wow her and rob are electric together enjoyed myself so much during this film didn want it to end1.0\trob os fantastic reminded of christian bale though this theme is lot darker ben affleck batman is kinda funny comic in wholesome way guess this is movie that deserves praise catwoman is fantastic and sexy as always1.0\tthe story is good long but not boring dark the most handsome batman his opponent is very clever music is very good the ending was full of despair and hop catwoman is beautiful looking forward to the next one like batman he doesn have super powers he just person1.0\twas very good ill have to watch again in 4k on the tv as the film is very dark but exactly what think of when think of batman the film seven came to mind few times watching it im not sure if loved or liked dano performance exact score is for me1.0\trobert pattinson played his role as batman perfectly critics say that this movie is close to the dark knight but think that it is completely different from the dark knight trilogy the cinematography is 10 10 this movie is worth watch1.0\tthis movie is batman at it best the way it should be from the original series very good job make sure not to change batman again you have the right guy now just keep him with this role and you have your star amazing on all levels batman need to return in two years make it happen1.0\tthe effect of this batman character on me was that gordon was like watchdog he was chasing after gordon when they called him freak gave them the right batman shouldn be portrayed as masked freak despite everything there is lot of effort so 100.0\tlove batman loved the chris nolan trilogy this new batman movie am not so sure was not alone after the movie ended the whole audience was left wondering what it was an average story and extremely slow and boring timeline of the movie it was not engaging at all went to the movie looking at all the 10 star imdb reviews but seems like have to be careful going forward do not understand these 10 star reviews at all0.0\tnever thought batman movie could be boring but his one proved me wrong the pacing just drags think they were trying for tension but it was really just bunch of guys standing around trying to figure things out it is three hour long movie which could have been done in 90 minutes1.0\treally don get where the hate for this movie is coming from enjoyed it mean it solid movie its clearly the start of trilogy thought batinson did great hes playing year batman hes not supposed to be bad ass yet cat woman was great the movie really highlighted batmans detective skills the movie was too long and could of had little more action and stuff for batman too do but overall it was good stop comparing it to nolan trilogy nothing beats that1.0\tthis is the batman film we ve been waiting for since our generation was pulled into tas all the way back in the 90 whereas nolan epic dk trilogy thrilled audiences by grounding the universe into tense gritty reality reeves outstanding direction thrusts the character into crime noir thriller with the batman himself often stealing gasps as ferocious intensity emerging from the shadows this batman is still young still angry and it used to great effect it genuinely brilliant and fresh spin on the mythos which does well to address the motivations of such character in the modern world justifying the caped crusade for another descent into darkness the supporting cast are fantastic in their respective roles we are presented with an unhinged and fractured genius in the riddler an ambitious brutal gangster in the penguin and special mention must be given to the most faithful portrayal of catwoman to date overall if you like any batman film if you enjoy any crime thriller this film will pull you into its heart pounding dangerous setting so easily and so deeply that you won even noticed that you ve your pants after ignoring your bladder for three hours see it in the cinema for the best experience1.0\tthis is the best batman on film so far and the film is near masterpiece instead of retreading familiar ground it expands on 80 year old history of batman and even questions his true motives for fighting crime the director actually addresses the complaints and nitpicks by moviegoers about the previous incarnations of batman like his detective skills being barely addressed apart from tdk him being sidelined by the villains and his limited screen presence in his own movies1.0\tbeautiful and dark an astonishing work from matt reeves and robert pattinson displaying the batman in brand new way on screen loved the gloomy mood and the investigative noir nuance that characterize the film1.0\tfantastic movie impeccable performances plot that hooks you from start to finish the soundtrack is simply epic script that doesn weigh you down the batman has managed to establish itself as one of the best movies of 2022 watch it now1.0\tit literally everything you ll ever want in the batman movie the plot is fascinating with some horror mystery that will excite you for what next with the riddler plan this film doesn just exactly represents bruce wayne but it also represents the true form of gotham city robert pattinson take on the caped crusader was great along with zoe kravitz phenomenal role as catwoman colin farrel andy serkis and jeffrey wright all done an amazing job with each of their respective roles the director matt reeves killed it with amazing shots visuals and the lighting of the film that shows how serious every part of the film is1.0\ttim burton batman and chris nolan dark knight love child if this movie doesn earn oscars for it phenomenal cast demand recount matt reeves serves up dark gritty and comic bookesque realism that leaves you wanting fourth hour in gotham city the performances by the entire cast are epic and oscar worthy if you doubted like me robert pattinson donning the cowl of the savior of gotham we are left choking on our doubt mr pattison is the batman zoe kravitz is hands down the best catwoman ever to appear on screen sorry halle you have my undying love but colin unfreaking recognizable farrell is an absolute chameleon in his expert depiction of oz aka the penguin and paul dano riddle me this how did you come up with this unique and genius take on the riddler andy serkis as alfred just makes sense and jeffrey my favorite felix leiter wright is as you can expect my new favorite jim gordon how can you possibly be this good at the craft without million oscars all hail matt reeves the savior of the dc verse1.0\tnobody does it better robert pattinson is the darkest knight ever und the dc universe it more detective story than comic movie the whole mood and the sets remembers seven and little bit of blade runner must see movie0.0\tshall start with who the hell is vengeance came to see batman saying batman it was my first provocative bad story the narration was very bad robert pattinson and zoë kravitz hits high level of bad acting the script was very poor the sentences weren even connected the original soundtrack was the reason why gave you star although the sound was over high as batman fan since saw the light this movie is 2022 biggest failure wish ww3 happened before watched it1.0\tultimately still prefer christopher nolan batman films this latest entry is strong fourth on my personal batman list here why realism make no mistake the batman looks and feels like comic book think greig fraser is really talented but his cinematography is not invisible foxcatcher felt like it was filmed inside sepia drenched polaroid from 1986 killing them softly looked like chiaroscuro painting the batman is absolutely drowning in so many layers of black and rain that it loses any sense of realism fairness reeves said this was intentional they deliberately used suboptimal lenses and blurry images he wanted gotham to be immersive it is but it immersed in muck it lives in an admittedly beautiful but ultimately surreal gotham nolan gotham traded the goth part of the city name for more modern settings his gotham felt like straightforward blend of chicago and new york which it pretty much was along with pittsburgh in rises an endless metropolis full of corrupt politicians where the bruce waynes of the world live quite comfortably and the rest of the city struggles the director rarely shows the full city skyline try to find one instance where you can see the top of the tallest building in frame in the dark knight ledger bullets echoing off the city buildings downtown sound real locations felt like real places not sets effects felt practical even when they weren and yes lot of this is because you can actually see what the hell is going on startling amount of the dark knight trilogy joker blowing up hospital the final showdown between bane and batman takes place in broad daylight the dark knight trilogy felt more grounded in reality to me which helped keep me invested in the characters consequences felt heavier villains scarier stakes speaking of consequences don think cared about single one of the riddler victims in the batman and maybe three characters in total say what you will about how thinly sketched the katie holmes maggie gyllenhaal character was in nolan movies when you see the burst of air hit rachel face seconds before the explosion in the dark knight it shocking harvey dent character was foundational part of tdk and his demise set up the entire plot of tkdr alfred being in the hospital after two scenes in the batman is way different than gordon being in the hospital after two full movies of character development in rises there were no stakes in the batman the threat was flooding city full of nameless strangers ambition nolan movies always border on pretentiousness but you have to admit his batman movies all had something to say begins was partially about fear and how it used and abused by those in power tdkr at least tried to address disparities between the ruling and working class of gotham before finally succumbing to the typical league of shadows thanos killing lots of people is good actually supervillain nonsense ledger joker forced batman to engage in high minded high stakes debate about human nature it was ridiculously ambitious filmmaking for comic book character everything in the batman has been said before the idea of villain being the other side of the same coin as batman has been done to death including nolan version of the joker we get it he an anti hero one step removed from villain all that said pattinson batman is believably damaged more than growly voice or tattooed forehead could ever convey his chemistry with kravitz selena kyle is real speaking of selina kravitz steals every scene she in there plenty of promise for future movies and excited to see where reeves takes it just hope it more fully realized vision next time1.0\tthink this is 10 because of how well crafted it is and the dedication that was put in the making of this film you can see how the cinematography storytelling and acting were so well handed through the consistent running time of three hours even though it solid piece of filmmaking it still doesn match the achievement of the dark knight it doesn have the same tension and pacing that kept you hooked to the seat instead it takes it time to build up magnificent crescendo to great climax in which the stakes ended up being higher the editing was one of the best things in this movie and pattinson actually made us care about the character and follow him through all the film paul dano as the riddler was something else he embodies the criminal mind in such clever and disturbing way that makes you respect him as villain feel like they made better storyline for catwoman this time around unlike in the dark knight rises where she was just side character in convoluted plot this is definitely great way to start new franchise but it also complete movie on this own instead of just focusing on doing the next sequels by reaching the three hour length it also reminded me of blade runner 2049 also because of the noir style matt reeves has made his best movie so far and glad it was the new batman movie hopefully they keep bringing fresh ideas for the rest of the movies1.0\tthis is great movie but certainly not the best batman movie out there robert has played the part of bruce wayne perfectly but not my favourite batman portrayal costume design ever the riddler at first gives lot of heath ledger joker vibes in his plan of killing but falls short in the second half as his plan does not make lot of sense the visuals are great but sometime sjust too dark in my opinion still definitely worth watching in my opinion1.0\tloved tdk when it came out it was in my all time favorite top 10 great cinema so have to compare these two directly and the winner is the batman have watched tdk again since watching the batman and it just doesn match the gothic feel that really enjoyed from this new movie when you compare two incredible movie that use the same subject matter you see 14 years of cinema evolution it is surprising how quickly movies age these days that doesn mean the old movie is bad god no they have used lot of what was great in tdk and gone in different direction with it can recommend it enough cinema exists because of movies like these1.0\twhen heard that they were making batman again first thought was they cannot match the dark knight trilogy and should not attempt it too but they did it and did it well will have to watch it again couple of times more to decide but think like this one better then any dark knight film0.0\tunderwhelming acting that is only matched by the way the bad guys acted in the dark knight video games true disappointment after seeing the ex vampire deface batman for about 30 minutes or so couldn take anymore and exited the theater batman died with the christian bale series at least until the next 42 batman movies come out val kilmer did better job1.0\tthis movie exceeded my expectations the riddler was so scary and pattinson for sure was the best live action batman the action was amazing the cinematography was amazing and the theme songs were incredible everything about this movie was amazing for me and never thought any hero movie would be able to beat the dark knight1.0\tgorgeous film from beginning to end reeves deserves every amount of praise that comes his way the costume designers and set designers are the real heroes to me though gotham has never been more thoughtfully realized steering much closer to comic accurate depiction and not the boringly realistic chicago of nolan fame don worry like those movies too incredible breath taking and overall masterful cinematography by greig frazer this cannot be understated undervalued every image was painting editing as well was really good if little uneven at times zoe kravitz puts in great performance as catwoman as does colin farrell as the penguin great prosthetics work for the latter but robert pattinson as the brooding bruce wayne and paul dano as the unhinged riddler absolutely steal the show honorary mention to barry keoghan for his role in the deleted scene seen after the premiere he did an incredible job in his extremely short time and excited to see where they go with that my only qualms with the movie were that it has trouble with batman power level in my opinion as well as riddler turn into sociopathy not really making any sense riddler is taking out politicians and crooked gangsters but then suddenly decides that the city got to go too if there had been bit more of an inciting incident scene where we could have seen that particular decision be made and more importantly why it was made think it would ve gone long way into making this true 10 10 and would ve given the transition from the second act to the third act more smooth it comes across as another form of law enforcement societal propaganda when the villain motivations and actions make lot of sense to them but because they need to be truly bad guy they suddenly turn into genocidal maniac at the end of the film and think that it not necessarily out of character but we didn see why he would go that direction if that makes sense one last strange decision that completely broke my immersion in the film was the set design for wayne manor it didn look much like place that people would ever build or live in really strange and over constructed in my opinion small but an important mention especially when seeing the movie at premiere overall nearly flawless batman film great to see batman as more of detective the world greatest at that1.0\tcommenced gravity one that can divide me but my cherry bears sins as to those attained by eve of the

intimidating but it honestly flew by so much better than having two sequels 1001.0\tnot to be that guy that feels cross media all has to be the same but as die hard batman fan and lover of the comics that are quite categorically the definitive batman stories was incredibly pleased by this film trying to think of things that would fault it on when considering that rating didn feel it was too long but like dances with wolves and wolf of wall street happy with long haul don want to give it lightly but when realised was tense the whole way through paul dano genuinely freaked me out the grime of penguin seedy underworld unnerved me and batman still had plenty of those batman moments satisfaction abound saw its inspirations running throughout not as nod or an off point for director wider vision but as the core construct that went deeper than synopsys this is detective batman batman that has to realise he can punch his way through every threat batman that has to deal with people that kill with pausing for james bond plot explanation it almost unfolds at comic pace it tangles web and carefully unravels it the action with all its heights is still grounded no special fx are there seemingly for the sake of exercising movie making technology no brash moments of over characterisation to say hey superhero movie right here have joke on us instead it confidently leads you through tale of dark corruption that so happens to involve three dispositioned people in costumes and gotham looks like for like lifted from the arkham video games which made me feel right at home1.0\thonestly still don know what to think of the batman it good movie it entertaining darker and more violent than usual but don think it great wanted it to be great of course then realized what was missing in my opinion emotion want to be emotionally invested triggered shocked to absolutely love movie for example ve seen joker times at the theatre in time span of months masterpiece because of the emotional rollercoaster you get sucked into by joaquin phoenix so that was bit lacking in the batman and because it was also feel the run time was way too long it has some great scenes though and one really funny one haha you ll know it when you see it pun intended1.0\tthis movie was definitely darker than any other batman movie but that made it even better 2hrs 56 min was just bit too long though they could have cut about 15 min but the casting was excellent1.0\tthink it was very good batman the thing have to complain about is the time its just little bit to long some conversations were just boring but all in all it was very good batman1.0\thad low expectation for robert pattinson as batman but wow did he deliver instead of hardcore metal batman we got with bale here we get more grunge rock batman kinda psychotic depressing looking bruce wayne but still really good would have loved to see more andy serkis as butler alfred he did play him really well paul dano plays the riddler well and and jeffrey wright aswell on gordon do think this is better then the nolan batman no but is better then ben aflack batman and the 90s batman hell yes it is the movie is not perfect feel the story is dragged bit to long and at sometimes think some of the scenes are bit back and fourth and hard to keep up with but still this well done and would love to see more of this batman should you watch it yes you should this is the best dc hero movie have seen in long time1.0\tthis is the closest batman movie to recapture the cartoon series that grew up watching the dark knight is still the best of the lot and then comes the batman1.0\tbeautifully shot fantastic cinematography really stylistic and has fantastic tone that it the acting dialogue and plot are all poorly done in execution especially the plot which is paper thin and has no tension whatsoever it meanders and fails to have any emotional impact zoe kravitz is honestly terrible as catwoman she cannot act at all there is also no chemistry between her and batman at all which makes it drag unfortunately this film is above average and it is nowhere near as amazing as half the public would lead you to believe it not even in the same stratosphere as the dark knight trilogy disappointment indeed but an above average film 101.0\tloved the movie it seems to be going inline with christopher nolan sequel vision showing the humane side of batman there are so much diversity in the cast and it seems to be intentional the movie is close to three hours but never felt bored loved the shots the sounds the music is epic the colors every thing is great highly recommended to watch1.0\tnever in million years would ever look at pattinson and say to myself he would make fine batman if it ever came to it and here he goes taking my breath away he did an amazing job portraying bruce wayne that have never seen on screen before zoe did an amazingly wonderful job at playing selena aswell the plot was gripping it had you on your toes and the feel of gloominess and darkness made the whole movie itself suiting and tolerable to it whole concept really did enjoy this movie and recommend it to anyone didn want to say much for anyone who is looking forward to watching the movie there are million other things would love to mention here but won see it for yourself think you might just faint1.0\trated it 10 on imdb that was absolutely beautiful wow seriously can wait to watch this again detective batman so well done had so many beautiful elements to old detective film noirs not like other batman films lots of little details they put into this that fit so well seriously kept thinking this needs to be nominated for awards just beautiful yes it long film robert pattinson is batman see why matt reeves wrote this specifically with robert in mind before even reaching out to robert to be in it pattinson did superbly amazing job handling this role seriously 100 want to see more of him as batman zoë kravitz was awesome casting choice she held her own brought depth to the character helped development the strained relationship with certain character in great way that left me wanting more kravitz also made the character her own she took the characters ground work that was laid by others and ran with it adding her own take at the same time paul dano as riddler is just tremendously perfect he demands your attention when he is on screen he shows side of ridder that we all know is there but have really only seen as lessor joker outside of the comics and the gotham tv show we get to see brilliant yet broken and unstable person someone who like in the comics is steps ahead of batman absolutely want to see more of paul dano as riddler colin farrell as penguin was also wonderful to see we get to see the sneaky sly lurking around but also always plotting penguin we know absolutely want to see more done with this character because it sets something up in great way walked away 100 wanting to keep watching and following each character would absolutely watch stand alone film of each character that was in this film be warned it heavy film the subject matter is heavy there are some incredibly uncomfortable situations that take place it also long film but worth it wouldn be surprised if change the rating to 10 10 after another watch hope this makes all the money and more1.0\tit pretty hard to match or beat the standard set by the nolan series for batman but matt reeves version in some ways matches and in some ways surpasses the nolan vision this film is clearly inspired from the grittier arcs of the batman comics like year one and the likes and the cinematography makes it seem like you re seeing comic panels come to life pattinson turns in convincing role as bruce wayne batman and while it takes time to get used to over the course of the film his take grows on you1.0\tdifferent angle to batman than in recent movies and it worked very well it is my new favorite batman movie the detective aspect worked well the sound design was spectacular1.0\tafter long time watched true batman super acting from all the actors music score and brilliant direction won compare dark knight trilogy though this is brilliance in its genre1.0\tokay went to watch the new batman to see what all the frenzy was about and have to admit this is the best version of the masked avenger story ve ever experienced and both fan of keaton and affleck creations had huge doubts after the trailer and promotional materials that appeared on the web and not only in terms of the cast but also the visual directions of certain elements that all comic book enthusiasts and in particular bat man adventures know and you know it hard for the fandom to get used to any changes in the brands they know and love from the cradle here however must admit that dir matt reeves took matters into his own hands threw away comic book elements even infantile although so far identified with batman and gave us heroes and world tailored to the expectations of the modern viewer and instead of another comic book mushroom about super heroes we get detective film in the atmosphere of noir in the style of the zodiac or seven yes know that place this film next to solid competition where few images can be compared but ladies and gentlemen the batman brand has undergone metamorphosis here comparable to the one that the 007 brand underwent with the advent of daniel craig era as the next actor to the role of james bond the heroes here are three dimensional characters driven by motivations with which the viewer can identify or at least understand the actors are perfectly suited to their characters whose stories do not necessarily coincide with the previously known canon nevertheless it is the mix and small twists that make here taste that is appreciated all the time visually the movie is delightful gotham is presented in similar way to the one we saw in the first installment of nolan trilogy although it is just more more and nicer although it is gloomy dark and full of dangerous alleys and scum that better not to look straight in the eyes the universe is created with incredible care each element fits the picture and nothing seems to be substitute for nolan obvious use of the chicago street scenery this is gotham to god damn gotham the city as always imagined it how does it relate to the story batman as mentioned is not typical action game although the action is quite enough and the corpse is thickly littered where it is required on the other hand above all the new batman is detective movie noir full blown where the plot seeps slowly and the viewer along with batman and det gordon becomes entangled in an intricate plot the successive clues of which are discovered step by step although sometimes there are more of these steps before reaching the next clue there are no shortage of surprising plot twists and action scenes fights or chases are woven in the right proportion and provide an injection of adrenaline where the average kowalski accustomed to marvel pulp would start to fall asleep will repeat myself but the heroes themselves are fact worth emphasizing and strong plot element the director takes his time with introducing new characters and devotes enough time to the viewers to care about their fate even in the secondary ones each character has its own introduction development and closure which gives the viewer feeling of great satisfaction especially compared to similar productions from dc or marvel is there anything to hang on to sitting in the room heard comment that the movie should end about half an hour earlier because everything looked like we were watching the ending and it turns out that it was only the introduction to the third act do not want to spoil it so let me just say that do not agree with the above view because the last 30 40 minutes is the culmination of the plot the master plan of the evil one and if the film ended where we thought it would completely undermine the influence of the main villain on the story history leaving lot of dissatisfaction what can cling to is the character of zoey kravitz somehow she doesn suit me for the role of selina but perhaps because it impossible not to compare her with hale berry who filled catwoman shoes and costume much better imo anyway had lot of concerns about the new batman although they concerned artistic choices with which did not quite agree however went without expectations and can boldly say that tim burton and christopher nolan gave us movies about superhero but it was matt reeves who provided real batman movie tailored to the detective stories that are his genesis reeves took handfuls of el burton visual duologies and the realism of nolan films while focusing on action and characters robert pattison himself is doing great admittedly it took him 14 years to pupate from vampire to bat although it was seemingly easy trick for vampires however it was not waste of time and pattison himself honed his talent and acting workshop showing what he can do with the next after edward cullen roles in such films as the lighthouse devil incarnate or good times here he provides us with bruce wayne torn by unworked trauma struggling with the effects of sleep depravation character withdrawn not only from social life but from life in general as his alter ego he is ruthless to villains and deals with them in an effective but very brutal way he also shows great insight in solving the main mystery and the scale of pattison acting skills complements and lifts the plot to new heights that few actors playing this character have achieved so far in general returning to the previous comparison think that you cannot compare the existing batman movies with this production because it has undergone the same transformation as the adventures of british agent 007 once in conclusion if you haven yet gone to the cinema strongly encourage you the new batman is piece of solid noir cinema in the style of the maltese falcon or the aforementioned zodiac and seven despite the projection time reaching hours the plot is captivating and it is complemented by amazing views of the surroundings taken alive from fritz lang metropolis and first class roles of talents such as jeffrey wright andy serkis paul dano and john turturro about collin farrel who plays great penguin not to mention wish there were more such superhero movies chapeau bas1.0\tthe batman offers different take on well known story it does not so by twisting the plot adding different moral dilemmas or introducing brand new action scenes with cutting edge technology contrarily it inherits only the basic characteristics of its predecessors even the bat mobile went back few decades to more modest form but tells us detective story in genre more noir than action or superhero look at its natural comparison what nolan series did is to tell the original batman at its best form the dark knight had been and probably will continue to be the ideal example of superhero movie in the upcoming decades it established bar that is very hard to surpass the movies that followed it although achieved some success still couldn get to the place where scorsese sees as cinema the most successful ones such as deadpool are the ones that tried to force the boundaries of the genre what the batman does it seems to me is to completely abondon this quest its attempt is courageous and this should be enough for any regular movie watcher to give it try its success is well more moderate in three hours long movie we see maybe twenty minutes of dialogue and forty minutes of action the rest is pattinson looking at his surroundings with his manly chick and half covered face there is very little acting even compared to above average superhero movies but especially compared to the last two batman series although the villains are more realistic and relevant to the west current socio political situation than the standard storyline which also means giving up the poetic villains we are used to the overall content is much less sophisticated we are not presented almost any background it is assumed that we know the batman universe we are also not presented any inner conflicts any moral dilemmas almost nothing that we can emphatize with or think upon one first suspects this serve the fog that must be present in noir movie but classics such as bladerunner show us both purposes can be achieved at the end the batman is dominantly noir movie that is not interested in its characters whether this be their background motives moral dilemmas or room for acting it relies on us to have knowledge about them beforehand but then what is left for the audience to watch is only the suspense and an opportunity to look at batman from different lense for three hours decent first attempt to make superhero movie more than its genre allows but it falls short of competing both the great movies of its genre and of its origin1.0\tthe seven vibe is working well with the plot but the performance of robert as batman wasn giving the vibe in my opinion generally the movie is good not too chewy after 3h but still the batman title puts you in certain state of mind didn got from the movie the darkness is so made it kills the edge1.0\tgood version rpattinson portrays bwayne well jturturro is worthy adversary other players are questionable photography great but script is slow very much work watching1.0\tdidn expect much but this rendition knocked me off my chair by far the most realistic encapsulation of the batman story we ve had by far the grimy scenes encapsulates gotham perfectly city slowly sliding into chaos the batman wasn some omnipotent superhero he was human he got hurt beat up and though he somehow managed to escape everytime it was not always pretty sight just guy some money trying to do good with his own two hands if you like realism this is your batman movie0.0\tthis is real disappointment this is not the batman it just another action movie with guy who wears batman mask even the mask is not real mask it joke the real batman is christian bale with christopher nolan1.0\tshort review after just seeing it brilliant adaptation this is triumph which to me feels like scott snyder batman in the new 52 series has come to life at the hands of matt reeves detective early years reclusive dark obsessive borderline mentally ill raw and depressive batman no playboy bruce wayne here and brilliantly mostly centred around batman not bruce and some brilliant comic book narration too with gotham city descriptions and narration very scott snyderesque perfect dramatisation of gotham and it characters seedy violent and corrupt police force and politicians cat woman was great strong character playing her own angle with great connection to the mob and perfect connection with the bat without becoming an overly distracting love interest penguin looks like deliberately growing project and the car chase scene was phenomenal this retro petrolhead bat mobile was superb also loved batman riding around gotham on an old steve mc queen world war style motorbike year zero while looking for leads the riddler portrayal was stroke of genius and acted superbly the mystery was brilliant detective storyline and the artistry and filming painted picture of gotham as it should be stylish dark the perfect gotham really did want an affleck batman film at some point and still do an older stacked aggressive bat with awesome fights and continuation of storylines we still hope might happen but really was very impressed with pattison brooding rendition and am absolutely loving what matt reeves has superbly kick started and am eagerly looking forward to the progression of this series absolutely loved it at times overwhelmed by how well it was portrayed and score was superb nirvana touch of class1.0\tdifferent perspective of batman into thriller movie really love it can wait for the sequel but the dark knight is still my most favorite batman movie1.0\tok to be honest was big fan of nolan the dark knight trilogy because he saved the sinking dc universe but as comic book reader non of the batman movies showed this cape crusaders like matt reeves did well come one dc stands for detective comics and this year batman just nailed it the batman directed by matt reeves starring robert pattinson as bruce wayne batman zoë kravitz as selina kyle andy serkis as alfred and paul dano as the riddler matt reeves is one of the best film maker in recent times when heard the news that he signed up to do batman movie was so exited but then was kinda disappointed when heard the other news that robert pattinson is going to play the lead role as the batman was like wait what just like the minions and he totally proved me that was wrong judging him this is batman just have seen it and wow the expectations were high as love matt reeves vision when it comes to storytelling and directing the most realistic batman film ever made ve never seen batman struggle that much the script was really tight and even though it hours long didn see any superfluous details top notch visuals sound and acting the soundtracks of the movie were really good after watching the movie it just stuck in my head very dense dark cold totally devastated dirty criminal city bruce is quite tormented gordon and bruce play detectives investigating all the rottenness of the police politicians and millionaires it very reminiscent of se7en this is probably the most intelligent batman script on screen everyone who matters is complex it endeavours to convey something about the character that doesn reek of edgelord or boring moral relativism world building is very smart and rolled out with impactful moments believe great things will happen after discovery pitching in warner media here is trivia matt reeves wrote the batman script with robert pattinson in mind without doubt would recommend this movie who likes to watch slow crime thriller investigation movie the batman director matt reeves reveals that he wrote the dc movie script with robert pattinson in mind before knowing he wanted the part joshua wilson1.0\tcan tell without further re watch if this take is as good as nolan the dark knight or better it at least as good props to giacchino for the amazing score greige fraser cinematography is filled with call backs to burton batman run1.0\tthe batman is my favourite film ever it has everything and the best things were that batman and gordon were working together as detectives to solve the riddles and every scene has batman also cat woman was amazing and batman and cat woman worked well together the riddler was interesting bad guy because he was menace in his suit then with it off he just looks goofy which thought was good the fight scenes and were 10 10 and robert pattinson played his role amazing1.0\tpossibly the best action amongst all batman movies great batman but awful alfred there are some flaws in the story and there is no chemistry between batman and catwoman but it entertaining if you are fan0.0\trobert pattinson does not display strength as the batman should he always looks shy scared brittle and certainly not intimidating meanwhile cat woman looked like she borrowed her mask the kick ss movie it very slow and extraordinarily long movie dc needs to up their game with their characters1.0\teverything was topnotch in this film not the greatest ever but the most realistic and most batman movie that we ve ever gotten dano is chilling as the riddler and this movie excels at creating gotham that so dark dirty and helpless that it seeps into the viewer psyche as they watch0.0\tone the worst film ever watched in my entire life here it is edward cullen becoming the batman disgusting one of the worst acting performance by pattinson and in general the film is huge1.0\tthis movie was so intense and dark great detective work and duo it had overall very good movie the almost three hours made it better it is now my favorite superhéroe movie marvel has done very good movies but this batman is just in another level of trying to be more realistic and relatable of gotham1.0\tit was the best story ever told in any batman movie ever made this movie was mix of die hard meets saw if there was pg 13 version of it and it needed to be as long as it was to get the story out there1.0\tabsolutly amazing the two storylines keep you glued to the screen and for true batman fans just stunning theres so much attention to details regarding charakters and the plot the first scene alone is cinematic masterpiece was worth the wait0.0\tanother steaming hot pile of woke absurdity excreted through the licked raw sphincters of the anti christ wretches who infest the hell mouth known as hollywood and the halls of power everywhere as sat down to endure this hour torture session wondered immediately not just if they would blaspheme our dear lord jesus but how many times they would attempt to use his holy name as worthless cuss word the diabolical tribe did not let satan down one little bit as they sandwiched in as many derogatory exclamations as they possibly could it not coincidence by the way the careless actors were paid well for their blasphemy no doubt and the creators too will reap nice reward from the horde of media addicted zombies stomping around our decaying world zombies they themselves have raised by the way so back to the drivel in question don expect anything good from this travesty the whole film is slanted towards the decayed and corrupt there is no hope for any of us monkeys is the message everything about the storyline and characters is an evil inversion can you not see that the good guys have nothing but contempt for god son he means nothing to anybody and he should mean nothing to you no to be good you must ooze unctious liberal or progressive values use them to lubricate your stealthy slide downwards into the very pits of hell where your eternal judgement awaits you along with everybody else who was involved with this video vomit not to mention the entirety of hollywood itself truly no good person would choose to breathe the same air as these reptiles the movie is as putrid as they themselves are my advice don pollute your minds with their filth0.0\twarning if you are true batman fan then don watch this movie total waste of time and expectations watched this movie with true fan enthusiasm but it was totally opposite to the previous movies of batman stories1.0\twent to see this movie without setting any expectations am fan of the dc universe not necessarily the movies and have seen all of them including the animated movies so far if you re looking for word to descrie this version think the best one is different you can say that it is bad movie nor that it is great movie in my opinion it is unique in his own way pattinson and reeves portrayal of batman is more anchored in reality than the previous versions we see batman that is very much flawed and that has very visible traumas from the past which is kind of new for this genre even his gadgets are less the james bond type and more like point break type from this point of view it has similarity with the last joker liked the detective point of view expected to see more of paul dano as riddler especially without the mask he was great cast and think they could have done even better job at developing the character even more in the battle of the brains there are virtually no limits to where you can go the visuals are also great they reminded me of tim burton version of the batman in any case strongly recommend that you watch this movie sleep on it and then think about it enjoy0.0\tmeaningles action movie for hours hard to call batman movie and can be the worst batman movie ever robert pattinson should be the last person in this role the story is boring and not flowing waste of time1.0\tmust watch the best superhero movie ever just wow is word to describe robert pattinson has acted with his eyes in this movie that looks so so great just how actor can show his emotions through his eyes that unbelievable he is the best batman from my point of view don listen to the critics who say it too dark movie could have been better man it not marvel movie that kids like it dc man it is dark and awesome which is the best way to show batman because he doesn hide in the shadow he is the shadow movie had everything emotion rage fear it totally different detective genre real comic fans of batman are gonna love it cinematography is 10 10 everything shot is insane it was like visual treat1.0\tunique take on batman leaning heavily into his iconic detective skills which none of the previous films even thought to explore pattinson is like man that is being held together by duct tape pain killers and madness then he puts on the mask and he like demon from hell an alien brutality and the atmosphere of gotham is just so cinematic and beautiful the batman feels like natural progression from what we ve come from with the dark knight trilogy the joker he transcends from the vengeance of gotham to the hope of gotham when that light hits the sky it not just call it warning1.0\twas not expecting this film to be as breathtaking as it was definitely blew my expectations out of the window when robert pattinson was announced as batman did not think he could live up to the character but he certainly did out of all the batman films have seen have never witnessed batman who is so open and interacts freely with the gotham people riddler character has definitely been redeemed from jim carey version and performance in the 90 turning him into sadistic serial killer he is showing his power his relationship with jim gordon and his actor throughout the film is also beautiful to witness what performance and what film the score for the movie was very impressive1.0\tbatman has always had the distinction of being the most realistic superhero but this film takes that trope and turns it into the full fledged noir thriller that we only got taste of in the dark knight but which was never completely developed until now with the batman the filmmakers made the wise decision to pick up the action in medias res and they also made the brilliant decision to make the riddler not crackpot doing the mafia bidding as the joker was in the dark knight but principled foil of batman with compelling though twisted sense of justice though the dark knight was milestone in the batman franchise for expanding the gangland noir element even that film appears dated when viewing the gritty thriller elements of the batman that have appreciably matured the central character and the entire world of the story ironically the dark knight significant weakness is that its strength lies almost entirely in the shock value of the joker character whose aim really is just joke in the batman however the riddler not only has shock value but also crucial in an effective villain plausibly justified aim born of compelling sense of justice with every murder he making gotham city and batman more aware of the corrupt nexus between organized crime and politics he really is the perfect foil for batman fellow clever orphan but one who grew up in poverty and who uses riddles to reveal criminal plots planned well in advance it great to see batman returning to his roots as detective that why robert pattinson brooding style makes sense because that how real investigator behaves the gorgeously immersive cinematography meanwhile makes gotham city into compelling character in its own right1.0\twatching the batman was like seeing visual narrative poetry to my eyes the story itself was really good you can feel this year two batman are very ambitious and conflicted at the same time the darker version of every batman movies1.0\tlet me first start by saying that loved this movie don get me wrong am huge batman fan ever since remember so let us first talk about the positives the vibe definitely love this dark grimmy serious vibe that dc once was it stood out from the usual colorful childish superhero movies every character fits perfectly in this world just like batman batman the looks of batman is cool like the batsuit and if this is just his second year than am excited for what is coming like how he doesnt have many high tech gears ans therefore the movie as whole was very grounded definitely like how this movie truly makes you understand why batman doesn kill and that alone was 10 10 catwoman thankfully this is not feminist movie where woman has to take over the show instead you get powerful side character that was an incredible bonus to the story and zoè performance was great is she my favorite catwoman am gonna avoid this question for now lol riddler interesting villain with unique riddles and traps but was kind of expecting the movie to show his brutal deeds not just skip over gruesome parts but he was still good memorable villain negatives unfortunetly there are also things didn really enjoy in this movie even though overall liked it as whole the story if you are not familiar with villains like penguin falcony and others you will probably get confused af like my wife the movie tries to tell so many stories in one movie that it will either make it boring for you or complicated it tells the story about bruce and history of his father the story about an orphanage and the city itself the story about underground criminals the story about dirty cops now mix all that with mystery riddles from riddler if all that doesn sound too much than you will enjoy it also hated bruce wayne not batman he looked like rich psychopath and also acted like one so imagine it should not be hard for someone to connect the dots together alfred was only in scenes and he was in my opinion wasted they could have kept the story more simple and use alfred more because he delivered nice emotions and heartwarming vibe fight scenes and fight choreographies are quite weak the wearhouse scene from bvs alone is better than this whole movie in that aspect all the good fighting scenes are already in trailers so you wont miss much if anyone had trained some martial art techniques they could probably beat batman the fear factor of batman was shown but didn feel it it shows you how criminals run away when they see the bat symbol in the beginning of the movie and then 30 minutes later no one has problem calling him freak to his face and pick fight with him that just felt stupid to me there are some nit picks about his car and other tiny problems but as first movie in the trilogy am invested to see more but as standalone batman movie would rather watch nolan batman begins than this one overall not bad movie but feel it had lot more potential 100.0\tve enjoyed every batman movie up till this one worst batman worst catwoman boring dragged out movie never have walked out of movie but did for the batman with 10 minutes left these 10 stars ratings must be from emo teens or die hard obsessed fans of pattinson0.0\tthis work was bad work about batman it was the first time saw batman weary of being batman and it was the first time saw myself tired of watching batman movie and in the conclusion the last laugh of the prisoner on arkam hospital hope this gay isn joker great regards to christopher nolan hama kawa1.0\tthebatman been waiting for this one and experiencing it in imax is 100 the way to go ohmygod to have the sound design and music score soundtrack reverberate through you for that visceral experience is unmatched engulfed by the massive screen the captivating art of cinematography is undeniable my guy robert pattinson that suit and batmobile only elevates what he brings to the man behind the cowl from the getgo was intrigued with reeves vision the noir grit tone that this superhero film grounds itself on shows how such genre can be rejuvenated an enthralling three hours of worthy fun really the energy lingering with you after the event is over really hope for sequel or even better trilogy from this production team1.0\tgreat cast choices dc best quality production in recent years finally dark knight level batman movie there were minor problems in the storyline but overall it was great directing and cinematography were absolutely stunning1.0\tloved robert pattinson batman certainly more than ben affleck and perhaps bit more than christian bale though say they re both brilliant in different ways watching batman detective work and hard hitting action sequences brought me back to the days when was really into the arkham games was most disappointed with the film length and paul dano unmasked riddler edward nashton the runtime could have been cut short by 20 30 minutes as some scenes felt little redundant also while dano was much more menacing underneath the mask his unhinged portrayal of edward did not seem convincing enough think he tried to pull off heath ledger the riddler was reminiscent of the joker from the dark knight in many ways but could not think he good actor am unable to put finger on what found amiss really also loved the other cast like zoe kravitz as the catwoman jeffrey wright as lieutenant gordon and especially colin ferrell as the penguin could not recognise him behind all that prosthetics1.0\t10 10 casting visuals music settings matt reeves has done brilliant job staying true to how the batman story should be portrait grounded gothic with some nice twists pattinson kravitz dano farrell delivered first class performances this movie has laid the foundations to push on and make an iconic trilogy1.0\tthe batman is back and with hours of movie it seems too long when you think about it but when it ended you will want more the dark mood of this film is amazing with all the colors the beautiful cinematography and the thrilling score the comparisons with zodiac and 7even are absolutely spot on as we get the mood and the tension of 7even and the riddles of zodiac add that to the batman and you get one of the best batman movies ever just behind the dark knight in my opinion robert pattinson for me is up there with christian bale as the best batman ever zoë kravitz finally gives some meaning to the catwoman and to the romance between her and batman the people who have been following paul dano career know that he would be brilliant as the riddler and he is jeffrey wright and andy serkis are really good too although wanted to see bit more of alfred colin farrell also delivers with an amazing transformation if you are expecting remake of christopher nolan batman you won get one instead you will get dark gritty raw detective batman with really well made fight scenes and the best chase scene with the batmobile in the history of batman movies it hard to find wrong things in this movie and for that reason ll need to watch it again maybe ll find one but doubt it1.0\thigh quality production and great storyline watching in 4dx really adds to the experience this film is very promising start to potential trilogy and batman is badass af1.0\tcaught this movie at an early screening this is the best depiction of gotham by far love the characters no one feels shoehorned in except for certain someone at the end buti guess they had to do it at some point paul dano pattinson kravitz give excellent performances as does the rest of the cast felt andy serkis was underutilized cannot wait for how the battinson trilogy goes1.0\thighly anticipated film which ends up feeling like project that could have done with better direction and better editing the story seemed to be going to where however in the bargain we do get very nice batman who is very unique compared to all the batman we have seen so far good job but could be better1.0\tif the previous batman movies were dark this batman is deep loved it not fan of robert pattinson as bruce wayne thought he looked too young and insignificant however thought he nailed the batman1.0\tthe batman really deserves all the praise it gets couldn take my eyes off the screen for one minute it was captivating and just so different compared to other batman movies in good way will definitely watch again1.0\tenjoyed this movie but the one major criticism have was it reminded me of too many other great not batman movies and its paced very slow laughed out loud at parts that weren intended to be funny particularly the batman and jim gordon back and forth whispered dialogue that seem to go on for hours when discussing the riddlers crimes patterson is fine batman but the penguin is done in masterclass fashion the riddler performance oh how hated the riddler so much in this movie the reason went not is that truly interested in seeing more of this new gotham this movie stays in my head despite not loving it so much was done well here cinematography and tone of the movie was amazing can see why people would love this film and why one would hate it going again to positive is do appreciate that this movie does demonstrate hero film does not have to be cookie cutter though they did sort of do the oh no big catastrophe coming near the end of the movie maybe mini series format with this sort of storytelling would be better could go on about some long cuts in the film that could have been easily cut out entirely or resolved with quick line somewhere else in the movie to reduce runtime this movie cut down to two hours could have been near perfect1.0\twhat batman 2022 movie wants to express is really good the terrorists shout down injustice save mankind rebuild the world long live revenge and then shoot at the crowd with machine guns the real hero will only silently hold those outstretched hand watching batman movies in combination with current events is bit more ironic no matter how nice you say it no matter how many excuses you use to be forced and helpless you can change the fact that you invade other countries and indiscriminately shoot civilians0.0\tthe movie so bad we walked out of the cinema can imagine this mediocre movie having rating of the only explanation have is that most reviews are fake or bought therefore don give but all the people know who watched the movie disliked it even the radio station listen to rated the movie badly but unfortunately already bought tickets therefore an imdb rating of is ridiculous1.0\tthe start was bit slow but once you understand where the plot is heading you will be eager to find out who the riddler is the thing liked most about this movie is the way it was not predictable overall really solid would definitely give it1.0\twhy is this movie so damn good this is more like really excellent film noir with truly frightening serial killer shrouded in mystery conspiracy and corruption with batman characters in it rather than batman film the fight choreography is the best ve ever seen in any batman movie ever pattinson captures the year batman with brilliant subtlety the entire film you can see his bruce wayne batman is struggling with tremendous rage and pain not at all sure who either bruce wayne or batman is or how either one can continue to exist at times he brilliant confident and fearless other times you see flashes of doubt uncertainty and even little bit of fear zoe kravitz the moment you think things are wrapping up but then realize there still like 50 minutes of movie left and you think where the hell else is this movie gonna go and then it takes you there as swiftly as the batman rocket propelled tank car all the expected but well executed batman standards dope gadgets awesome tank car grappling hooks plenty of actual detective work etc there alot more than that to praise but again no spoilers and colin farrell as the penguin is insanely good he just wrecks that role and mean that in the best way possible1.0\tmaybe 3h is little long for those who don like the whole experience of watching movie but for me was the best the movie the action actors especialy robet pattinson was great1.0\tmatt reeves grabbed an unspoken side of dc comics he and robert forged away an amazing cinematic fantasy direction story acting and the intense scenes are at their best in short what master piece1.0\tnot much of person that favorites movies easily only have couple of titles that hold up to that and this is officially one of them maybe because another very strong title in my personal collection is fight club and this movie reminds me so much of that classic it hard to explain due to the fact there not much of similarities when you look at the plot but the overall feel got the way it made me think and the impact it left on me as left the cinema utterly amazing rarely anything pings my soul that hard but this movie managed to do it1.0\trobert pattinson is perfect as batman he has shown his ability this movie is also good but for the fans of batman this is very important want to see it next part the batman beg to warner brothers for it sequel ve become fan of robert pattinson don why people didn agree with his casting but now he replied to his hatters1.0\tthis movie felt different the cinematography was very good some shots were so creative and satisfying to watch musical score is ummmmmaah the plot was also good twisted but it not worth to hours long this movie felt different the cinematography was very good some shots were so creative and satisfying to watch the plot was also good twisted the influence of the taxi driver and zodiac felt really amazing bruce depression was normal but think this type of continous depression was too much or wierd to me personally the riddler given riddles cyphers clues encryption was not that intensive to me there are some specific moments that were unnecessarily extended specially in the first half of the movie these unnecessary shots created bit of distraction for me that could ve been avoided matt reeves detailing was really good but the attempt of putting too much details led him to put unnecessary extended shots from this point of view it was failure to find middle ground between detailing and boringness the coloring was great at night but it wasn that good at day time1.0\tjust watched it tonight and really enjoyed it as batman fan and movie fan this had lot of batman definitely more than in the past movies which was great because rob pattinson played him so well under the cowl it was near perfect movie but sadly it had its flaws long runtime wasn one of them though it was rather the slow parts that it had lots of scenes involving talking and investigating were dragged out feeling like filler that would bring down the tension the transitional music over the scenes became interruptive and excessive many times overwhelming the moments that could ve had their own breathing room with just sound effects and dialogue lot of batman movements while not in combat were inconsistently slow compared to fighting like walking and grabbing things during investigations many of the same locations introduced were revisited throughout the movie lacking in city and setting exploration and feeling repetitive and visually boring alfred very brief presence and the falcone arch towards the end had too much time dedicated to it that it took away from the tension of riddler murders and dived into more political and cliche route as well as having that not so subtle sprinkle of political correctness also falcone had this weird strangling fetish and catwoman girlfriend annika took too much time away from the main plot the best things about the movie batman action scenes riddler scenes while masked in costume penguin scenes and batman and gordon investigations at riddler crime scenes amazing epic sequences perfect camera angles aesthetics sound effects and music those are what pack the punch most when you watch the movie and you replay those scenes in your head after huge fan of the arkham games and this definitely had the vibe of arkham knight mixed with batman year one pieced together as crime thriller similar to se7en btw riddler scenes felt very reminiscent of heath ledger joker from the dark knight and loved that batman theme is also incredible and resonates with you after hearing it the movie just needed some trimming and corrections to its pace and plot it was hours it could ve filled in lot more it needed to focus more on riddler it needed more alfred it needed more penguin whereas catwoman her girlfriend falcone the election for mayor those aspects could ve should ve been much more brief the tension in the movie would basically fluctuate riddler did something it went up batman dealing with catwoman problems and figuring out the corruption behind his family it went down going to new locations it went up going back to those same locations it went down it didn have that escalation aspect like nolan trilogy had where each scene was taking you higher and higher but that wasn surprising because this is matt reeves film as he did in dawn and war for the planet of the apes his filmmaking is more slow burning more thematically socio political more narratively repetitive and more stylish with the camera regardless matt reeves still did great job overall with the batman enjoyed watching it and definitely watch it again specifically the epic scenes that it had because man did it have them is this on par with the dark knight no the dark knight trilogy still surpass the other iterations but the batman certainly comes right at as one of the best batman movies ever made and more is yet to come1.0\tnot too much action but fighting is brutal and good more of detective type of movie entertaining and vary grounded in reality no superhuman abilities and such did enjoy it music is spectacular and movie overall have that dark tone all over it bit slow but nevertheless captivating nice job robert we got new batman zoe is the goddess nice pair and chemistry1.0\teverybody should watch it grim gritty and gripping super noir the batman ranks among the dark knight bleakest and most thrillingly ambitious live action outings1.0\tgonna make this review very brief awesome dark noir version of the legend but in my opinion too long and could have had bit more action actors and acting were great must watch in the movies for batman lovers dark soundtrack was great too1.0\tthe batman has to be one of if not the best comicbook movie out there the cinematography the worldbuilding the scenography the effect and the acting all come together to create and absolute masterpiece the highlight of the movie is by far paul danos perfomance although robert zoe and everyone else did an amazing job 11 100.0\tjust mix between twilight and fast and furious this is just normal action movie with bit of romance with no good story behind boring hour movie trust me would like to unsee have see lot of rating movies and this is not one of them it deserves tops1.0\tthe batman is love letter to all batman and comic book fans matt reeves did it he delivered what the previous directors could not as huge batman fan can say with big confidence that this is by far the best live action batman we have ever seen probably the best comic book movie of all time too the whole cast is amazing and robert pattinson kills it delivering the best batman and bruce wayne in the history of cinema before this movie believed that nobody will be able to top the nolan films but after watching this movie realized that this is the real batman we always wanted to see the cinematography plot soundtrack all are indescribable this is masterpiece that must be experienced on the big screen more than once1.0\tthis is one of those movies which will be talked about for long time to come from the starting it just suddenly takes you off like you re on road trip an entertaining one perhaps bruce seemingly vulnerable and unstable conditioned although he in his early vigilante days the action scenes are roof blowing and top notch all those night flights sort of remind me of marvel daredevil even thought it somewhat similar to it still it seems to differ in many norms altogether massive masterpiece it is indeed cause of the ending which was shocker for many some were like what the hell is he doing he batman well it was one of the most batman things he did in my opinion1.0\tit was full of beautiful shots and every minute had batman bruce you could feel the emotion in every scene also the actors played every character perfect except zoe kravitz she was iffy0.0\tprobably the worst batman film ever been and most likely ever will be batman is like one of us who is riding the bus almost no tech no nothing robert didn even work hard on the voice the goes everywhere by walking the only great actor is the riddler alfred is too detached skip this one if you can this is like documentary that shows batman is human being who rides busses who can be afraid have nightmares etc1.0\tthis batman film is for those fans who know batman not only from the nolan movies or dceu but are familiar with the comic depictions the video games and the telltale series robert pattinson batman is truly masterpiece in terms of bruce wayne image as detective when robert pattinson was cast as the batman was skeptical about it thought he won be nearly as good as bale batman but he has exceeded my expectations he is the batman of my era in other roles zoe has killed it as the catwoman she was top notch throughout the movie another character that should be recognised for the performance is the penguin world class acting the score to the cinematography to the presentation of nirvana something in the way everything was on point in my opinion the film should have been atleast rated it could have made the movie more abosorbing can understand why some people are leaving bad reviews about this movie because they aren familiar to this kind of batman going to the movie with different expectations thank you matt reeves for this beautiful movie cinematic masterpiece1.0\tto start off am huge batman fan this movie provides everything as fan wanted to see from batman character was getting bored of the james bond esque masculine fantasy characterisation of bruce wayne this depressed and unhinged batman definitely made him the most interesting character within the movie unlike in previous films were he was easily overshadowed by the villains the acting and casting was perfect everybody captures the essence of these characters and it was extremely encouraging to see loved batman relationship with gordon and alfred the villains penguin riddler and falcone were all really great gotham looked unreal it looked so gross and grimy loved it very reminiscent of the burton movies had my favourite batmobile so far the detective element of batman on the big screen almost felt liberating to witness as comic fan do have my gripes with this movie though it was way too long hours for movie is unnecessary and it could have easily lost 30 mins the pg rating was huge detriment could feel it holding back constantly and it was very noticeable unfortunately it also suffers from what call covid movie pacing the disruption in filming believe heavily impacted the final edit and it seems pretty obvious in the films sometimes janky pacing and length catwoman was way too involved in the plot personally already don like catwoman as character basically in all media including comics movies and cartoons she is two demential and overly sexualised overall find her very uninteresting and that wasn any different in this film honestly don think this depiction of batman was even ready for love interest so the quick progression of their relationship was quite jarring felt forced and didn suit the tone of hermit batman though zoe kravitz worked well with what she was given and she looks exactly how imagine catwoman to look wish the riddler was in it more and that his character wasn obsessed with batman bit too joker rather that he was solely obsessed with out smarting him all in all really exciting to see what to come next was of rating but literally cannot stop thinking about this movie for some reason so for that ll give an1.0\tvery interesting movie they likened this film to being the heir to the nolan trilogy the road is the right one but with all due respect the nolan trilogy is at the level of perfection pattinson very good at playing batman looking forward to the sequels1.0\teverthing in this movie is what young batman should be the art direction is so good that it makes you feel gotham atmosphere the scenario the acting and the choreography is on level that matches in my opinion the greatest representation of batman ever arkham game series1.0\tthis is new take on gotham hero really enjoyed the storytelling the cinematography is worth the song storytelling overall really great view the cast and creative narrative is different from the existing batman genre so this opens up new audience segments in addition to the existing fan following of the cult1.0\thalf an hour too long not everyone can sit for hours to watch even the best of movies moreover the plot is bit over complicated the music is great cat woman even better1.0\tthe batman is the most complex and unique superhero movie have ever seen this movie is technically superhero movie but in truth it detective noir that has heavy inspirations from zodiac and se7en and with detective noir mystery is key component that the batman nailed perfectly and that was prominent by the riddlers riddles which created an atmosphere of suspenseful chase between him and the batman and in this movie we finally get to see batman detective skills he really is chasing after this serial killer and properly investigating this whole case as detective would and because of that this movie is mostly starring batman and its from his perspective for around 90 percent of it the batman was an incredibly acted movie robert pattinson in my opinion is one of if not the best batmen we have ever had on screen he perfected that role and seemed like batman effortlessly his silence and demeanor throughout the movie spoke louder than his words paul dano was phenomenal as the riddler he gave us one of the best villain performances in long time and in certain scene without spoilers his acting was beyond incredible zoe kravitz was perfect as catwoman she is honestly my favorite catwoman in any batman movie and her chemistry with batman was great jeffrey wright as jim gordon was great casting choice and he also had great chemistry with batman andy serkis was also great alfred and he had really heartfelt scene but would ve loved to see more of him have left the most surprising one for last collin farrell as the penguin honestly no could tell it was him playing the character he was phenomenal and he stole the show every time he was on screen but there is another character that needed to talk about separately and its gotham city itself the way its portrayed in the movie how it developed and how it was exposed throughout it changes the perspective of the viewer and batman himself this city is difficult to live in its dark and gritty and that is where greig fraser is key component his cinematography in this movie is stunning every shot was colored to perfection and it complemented the tone of the movie very well another strong aspect of this movie was the music michael giacchino gave us his best ever work in this movie the batman theme gives me chills every time hear it its honestly incredible the way he composed the music for this movie was phenomenal the songs enhanced every emotion you felt on screen from fear danger sadness and mystery the action in this movie was phenomenal it had some innovative action sequences that will keep you engaged or even have your heart pumping and this movie also has the best car chase scene have ever seen in my life cant stress enough how good it was the batman never failed to keep me engaged or on my toes it was thrilling and gripping even though its almost hours those hours are filled with suspense mystery drama incredible dialogue with memorable quotes and breathtaking opening 20 minutes that gave us one of the best introductions to batman character in movies this movie had my attention so easily that forgot to eat my popcorn completely also loved that this movie did not force comedy like lot of superhero movies it had tone and it stuck with it its was dark mysterious and psychologically challenging this movie also had great character development every character was able to discover something about themselves and adapt to their new situations and on top of that all of the character decisions are reasonable even the antagonists you were able to dive into their thought process and understand where they came from and what made them who they are everything positive just said would not have been possible except for the real mvp of this movie the mastermind behind it the director writer and incredible filmmaker matt reeves who did beyond phenomenal job in his directing every frame he chose every angle every shot were artistic and perfect he innovated and took risks that and made passion project that am thankful for when watched the movie had few nitpicks which were that the movie 3rd act was not at the same level of the first but after sitting with it there is meaning behind the 3rd act and it serves purpose that cant discuss because of spoilers another thing that wish was the that the movie was 18 plus think it would ve served the movie more and made it an even better experience as some scenes were affected bit by the pg 13 rating overall this movie is immersive gripping complex multilayered and psychologically challenging its not movie that everyone will be able to grasp and appreciate but the ones who do are in for one hell of movie my final score is 10 100.0\tit doesn matter how good movie is written or directed if you pick up the wrong actor it will always fail in this case picking up pattinson as batman the movie deserves to fail0.0\tone of the worst and longest movies ve ever seen almost hours of annoying music and awful play looks like batman as an idea and concept has died1.0\tthis film had everything that expected plot twist action and an incredible batman don know if it is the best batman film in my first impression yes need to rewatch it to have final opinion but one thing is sure robert pattinson is the best batman loved zoe kravitz interpretation and jeffrey wright too paul dano was incredible for colin farrell like his penguin now have hype for watch the penguin and gcpd series1.0\tjust casual viewer but this movie had some really good looking scenes with stunning sound for example the batmobil scene and really liked the insight in bruce thoughts and the detective approach1.0\tdefinitely keep an open mind going into this one personally didn think robert pattinson could be great at portraying the caped crusader but wow am glad to be wrong on this he absolutely killed it it totally original take on batman that isn anything like the classic bruce wayne or the prime earth depiction his performance of the character has him being very introverted it doesn do classic origin story which is nice change up but it implied that rich orphan boy who grew up alone in mansion would develop this exact introverted personality robert pattinson has said he finds bruce batman to be bit of freak and it perfectly captured don want to spoil details so go and watch the film for yourself anyone who is comparing this to the dark knight trilogy or marvel you can this is completely different take on batman and this isn your typical super hero story if majority of comic book live actions are called movies then this film this has the potential to win many awards in my opinion this is the best comic book film since 2008 the dark knight nothing in the last decade comes close to this unless you re looking for something that isn dark and you want happy comedic disney type of hero movie1.0\tthis is by far my new favorite batman movie even my favorite superhero movie in general the nearly hour runtime flies by while you get completely immersed from the cinematography to the score everything is amazing when the score kicks in as batman creeps out of the shadows it amazing don know how else to put it1.0\tworthy reboot after the horrendous attempts of batman superman doj justice league matt reeves deserves respect just like chris nolan for his vision of the batman drop everything and just go and watch the batman can wait for the sequels robert pattinson outstanding ensemble supporting cast wonderful1.0\tthis is the batman we were looking for finally matt understood the direction of the dark knight recommend this to watch in imax 2d you will love it for me it0.0\tif you like being bored to death and need to get hours of sleep this is the movie for you nolan batman was good you liked the characters this movie batman could die be improvement you don care if he lives are dies for that matter not one person in the movie do you really care if they live or die the long hour movie has maybe good scenes in the whole thing while did like they tried to make cat woman better character you really didn care about her either so you want to film movie where is extremely dark like at midnight with no lights on but 12 watt bulb and everyone whispers and think this is good idea movie was waste of film im glad they don use film anymore they can erase it use the digital media film something better garbage would call it only it would give bad name to garbage story was bad filming was bad directing bad and the acting was subpar if this hadn been another well known action fleck with the name batman in it it would have bombed1.0\tthe batman amazingly adapts many visions of batman from the pages of earth one ego year one and long hallowen to the character on our screens like arkham games batman and the telltale batman to crate the ultimate dark knight1.0\tbatman movie that is actually about batman that questions the core aspects of the character without disrespecting his roots beautiful thrilling and with one of the best movie scores of the past 10 years1.0\thuge fan of the nolan batman series but don expect this to be anything like its predecessors take it for what it is dark sometimes flawed version of batman the cinematography and dark vibe to the whole movie gave it an eerie mystery thriller vibe much like the movie se7en saw it this afternoon and ve been thinking about it all night replaying the scenes over and over in my head can wait to see it again to find out what missed the first time around it long movie but found myself checking the time because didn want it to end go see it now1.0\tthe batman is absolutely breathtaking and it can be said that the best movie of 2022 so far robert pattinson also did his best performance in his career he proved that he could be better batman even better than christian bale great cinematography with great story but the only drawback was that some of the scenes in the film were slow and boring but nothing less than the value of this film the fight scenes were badass and amazing and the end of the film was one of the best endings in the history of cinema even better than the end of the dark knight in my opinion this film should win an award in the best screenplay and best actor robert pattinson category1.0\tthe overall plot and character choices were perfect was peak movie good way off explaining the plot and the riddles you have to watch this movie robert was an amazing batman it felt like if batman was real this is what it would be like he made batman feel so real which is something the other batman did not give1.0\tperhaps not better film than the dark knight yet still masterpiece and comparable the batman shaded with filter of se7en is in my mind better or truer batman film than any of nolan gotham is perfectly corrupt and dark colin farrell obviously sensational1.0\tsorry but the batman so epic in cinematography and show us the real batman so mysterious and noir not bored for every scen in this movie people say so boring and long reply bro you not understand the art of films and just watching anime lol1.0\thaven watch dc movies for long time but the batman was really good the script and the visual effects are above the dc average since the batman 2003 would suggest to have the joker next batman1.0\tbest batman yet reeve and pattinson take on batman is fantastic and not something we ve seen before pattinson and kravits have great chemistry too1.0\tthe batman absolute incredible it includes all the things the previous batman movies won have the batman detective side cool gadgets incredible batmobile and obviously the catwoman mean was in love with michelle pfeiffer catwoman but after watching this zoë kravitz deserve standing ovation the camera angles nd the swift moments were upto the mark great direction and screenplay paul dano top notch acting with colin farell character built up last but not the least you gotta give it to robert mean he poured his acting skills into this movie great expressions especially when he gets angry and develops fear in the criminals heart of gotham1.0\tthe batman is the first live action adaptation of batman to really enter in his mind and with bruce being on his second year with serial killer it gets really interesting this film shows how bruce is broken in the inside and detective part of batman that it is done perfectly congrats to matt revees and his crew the movie is fantastic1.0\tmust watch from the first scene itself it is made clear the amount of thought work and creativity that has gone into the making of this movie this movie will scare you indulge you in its mystery excite you with its action and amaze you with its commitment to telling truly dark and gritty tale about the corruption in gotham matt reeves has done masterful work in directing each scene he is point of view driven director there are many shots in this movie where he puts you in the character shoes and shows the world from his point of view and how the world perceives him as batman enters the crime scene you are put in his pov and can see how much each and every police officer sees him as menace and doesn want him to be there this really helps establish the world and the relationship within in very subtle way he also has wonderfully implemented some scenes of horror and thriller which were unexpected and had given way to some nailbiting and riveting scenes think forgot to breathe during the batmobile chase scene all the matt reeves direction has been enhanced by greg fraser camerawork gotham is very dark and gritty but never feels dead unlike so many other movies he allowed blacks to be actual black and not shades of grey and then dialled up the contrast allowing the colours to pop orange and blue colour has such amazing interplay between them and completely suits the dark depressing setting of gotham michael giacchino score for the batman is his best work yet as the film picks up in terms of action you can start hearing little hints of dum da dum dum pick up and you just know things are going to get intense other than the adrenaline filled main theme he through his soundtrack is very well able to showcase moments of mystery emotion and romance yes this movie has romance this might have been the least amount of talking done by the batman in any of the batman movies because robert pattinson is so well able to display emotions through his body language and expressions pattinson brings in different take on bruce wayne who is depressed and little eccentric billionaire who has travelled the world to gather knowledge and is always analysing his surrounding is bound to be an introvert and kind of recluse and this is very well showcased by him robert has done an amazing job talking about side characters there were loads of them and each one of them has done an amazing job for me the stand out was definitely penguin and catwoman the story is straight up murder mystery thriller where batman and gordon are sent on hunt by riddler which reveals the deep dark secret of gotham elites including batman own past without spoiling much the story plays out very much like se7en zodiac and the long halloween comic book this allows the world greatest detective to actually do some detective work and you get lost in that journey to trying to piece all the different puzzle pieces the batman is not good story because it an indulging murder mystery but because it allows the characters within to grow as well as batman catwoman alfred and penguin are caught in the middle of these murders they all grow as character in their own way which makes me excited for the sequel finally would like to say in world where most of the comic book movies now seem like painting of scenery you have seen thousand times being sold in walmart here is movie that is something that is hung on the entrance of downtown museum brought to life by picasso 255 people found this helpful helpful unhelpful1.0\tloved it knew robert pattinson would kill it he is so great at expressing emotions in his eyes and jaw the casting for everyone else was also spot on glad there wasn much on back story that we all know and love it was gritty and so much like the comic books it moved fast for an almost hour movie lots of characters but not over the top1.0\tpersonally really loved this darker down to earth style batman when first heard robert pattinson was the new batman didn really think anything of it but after seeing the movie robert definitely blew my mind as batman showing batman darker side and detective side beautifully zoe nailed it as catwoman colin was terrific as penguin and finally paul dano was freaking terrifying as the riddler every scene he was in made me on the edge of my seat absolutely crushed his role loved this movie so much really looking forward to the sequel and seeing that special someone1.0\tfrom the start of the movie till the very end this movie is filled with mystery and intrigue fantastic set pieces and action sequences the menacing noir batman score the haunting riddler theme sends shivers up your spine when they first kick in robert pattinson develops brooding grunge batman which suits him perfectly and truly delivers at every front paul dano gives us chilling zodiac esque serial killer which will go down as one of the best on screen antagonists in superhero cinema the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking each frame is beautiful and poster worthy just when you think you ve figured everything out about the plot the movie has huge plot twist where you genuinely do not know what events will happen next all fans of superhero movies don miss this one1.0\tare you fan of the batman cartoon series in the 90s it for you guys this movie is so amazing it reminds me of the cartoon series it gritty it dark it violent it murder mystery film noir detective thriller1.0\tphenomenal very dark and quite different movie compared to previous versions the actors are very good especially robert pattinson good story the duration of hours is fulfilled so that in the end you have the feeling that it lasted even shorter1.0\tgreatest movie of all time greatest riddler of all time and greatest batman of all time everyone giving it star have nothing that backs up their little accusations of it being bad please do not lie1.0\tdark gritty detective story the look sound mood all come together to make this truly memorable batman story impressive performances especially from robert pattinson and paul dano wow1.0\tprobably going to watch it again because it so good from the music to the characters everything fits so nicely if were to change one thing however it would be the riddler1.0\tthe detective element of potraying batman as world greatest detective and the cinmatography with the story flow sort of reminded me of arkham city game1.0\tas batman fan had too much expectations from this one and it delivered everything could ve expected without wasting any time movie starts right on and clearly in my opinion it has one of the best opening sequences talking about robert pattinson he has evolved more than any actor ve ever seen he nailed it as batman and am intrigued to see what he is gonna do next with the character the cast of this movie is so apt and perfect all the actors ensemble together so well mentioning zoë kravitz coming from person who not catwoman fan zoë kravitz clearly killed as catwoman she and pattinson had great on screen chemistry overall in the whole movie was in complete awe of it cinematography the colours and dark palate of movie is freaking awesome my eyes were glued to screen the length of movie is debatable if it long but for me it gave me everything wanted so big thumbs up frm my side go watch it rn1.0\t10 incredible movie best batman movie and best batman yet would ve been 10 10 if the movie was 30 minutes shorter at one point it felt like specific scene was going on for too long either way knew robert pattinson would kill it as the batman but wow did he blow it out of the park the one thing can tell you is that this batman really is the world greatest detective1.0\tawesome movie pattinson did wonderful job more of detective than superhero movie goose bumps to batman and dc following the same ethics throughout rather than tilting for commercial benefits unlike mcu dc has proven their own prestige once again hats off dc the days are yet to come1.0\tofficially getting tattoo of robert pattinson that half edward cullen half batman the movie was way more than expected and already knew it would be good the music zoe kravitz fight scenes acting villains all of it 10 10 every time1.0\tthink that this is movie which contains all the necessary details to be the best hero movie for the last years hero just one hero to create lot of emotions nice written scenario perfect costumes an amazing music incredible cast performance last but not least couldn believe that the twilight guy robert pattinson could play the batman impressive loved his acting in tenet movie christopher nolan and now justified me excellent work matt reeves\n"
